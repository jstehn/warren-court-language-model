UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 430\nArgued: May 2, 1957Decided: May 27, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was indicted, convicted and sentenced under 145 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for the felony of willfully attempting to evade federal income taxes by filing false and fraudulent returns. Held: Section 3616 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which makes it a misdemeanor for a person to deliver to the Collector \"any false or fraudulent list, return, account, or statement, with intent to defeat or evade the valuation, enumeration, or assessment intended to be made . . .\" does not apply to this offense; and the felony conviction and sentence under 145 (b) are sustained. Pp. 373-379.\n\n 234 F.2d 797, affirmed.\n\nPeter B. Atwood argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Rice argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Philip Elman, Andrew F. Oehmann and Joseph M. Howard.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae supporting petitioner were filed by Peyton Ford, Alan Y. Cole and James C. Herndon for Davis, and Jacob Kossman and Frederick Bernays Wiener for Binion, in Nos. 430 and 834, and Carl J. Batter, pro se, in No. 430.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner was charged in a three-count indictment under 145 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 with the felony of wilfully attempting to evade federal \n\n[353 \nU.S. 373, 374]\n\u00a0\n income taxes by filing a false return.\n1\n Upon conviction, he was sentenced to concurrent two-year prison terms and was fined $2,000 on each count. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the conviction on count one, but affirmed the convictions on counts two and three. 234 F.2d 797. We granted certiorari limited to a question of general importance in the enforcement of the income tax, namely, whether petitioner could be prosecuted and sentenced under 145 (b) for an offense claimed by him to be punishable also under 3616 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. \n352 \nU.S. 1023\n.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe threshold question is whether the conduct for which petitioner was convicted was an offense under \n\n[353 \nU.S. 373, 375]\n\u00a0\n 3616 (a). That section made it a misdemeanor for any person to deliver to the Collector \"any false or fraudulent list, return, account, or statement, with intent to defeat or evade the valuation, enumeration, or assessment intended to be made . . .\" and provided maximum penalties of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine, together with the costs of prosecution. 53 Stat. 440. If the wilful filing of a false income tax return was not embraced by 3616 (a), petitioner's case falls, and discussion of other issues becomes unnecessary.\n\nUnlike 145 (b), which appeared in the income tax chapter of the 1939 Code and was specifically and restrictively designed to punish evasion of that tax, 3616 (a) was placed among the Code's \"General Administrative Provisions\" and was general in scope. Failure explicitly to exclude evasion of the income tax from the scope of 3616 (a) is urged as ground for its inclusion, thereby making it a misdemeanor to file a false return with intent to evade the income tax, despite the specific felony provision of 145 (b).\n\nAs long ago as 1926 it was the Government's position that the predecessor of 145 (b) effectively repealed 3616 (a)'s applicability to income tax evasion. See brief for the United States in United States v. Noveck, \n273 \nU.S. 202\n, pp. 16-19. To be sure, during the last five years, the Government prosecuted a small number of minor offenses, we are told less than seven per cent of the criminal income tax evasion cases involving the filing of false returns, as misdemeanors under 3616 (a). More recently, a series of cases brought the relation of 145 (b) to 3616 (a) into focus and called for an interpretative analysis of the history of these sections in order to ascertain their respective functions. And so now, for the first time, has the Government made a detailed survey of the problem of alleged overlapping between 3616 (a) and 145 (b). \n\n[353 \nU.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 3616 (a) goes back to the Act of 1798, 1 Stat. 580, 586, when excise taxes and customs duties were the main sources of federal revenue. Being general in scope, this section, as successively re-enacted, was applicable to the first federal taxes on income, from 1861 to 1871, and again in 1894; there were no separate provisions for punishing income tax evasions. See, e. g., the Act of 1861, 12 Stat. 292, 309; the Act of 1894, 28 Stat. 509, 553.\n\nA different story begins with the income tax legislation that followed the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment. Section II of the Revenue Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 114, 166, contained its own criminal sanction. Section II (F) proscribed the making of a false return with intent to evade the income tax, an act that would otherwise have been punishable under what was then 3179 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, the immediate predecessor of 3616 (a). The offense would have been a misdemeanor under either statute. But II (F) provided a maximum fine of $2,000 while 3179 only permitted a fine of up to $1,000. It seems clear that II (F) displaced 3179. Such implied repeal, pro tanto, is further demonstrated by the fact that 3167, 3172, 3173 and 3176 of the Revised Statutes, related provisions in the enforcement of the revenue laws, were specifically incorporated, as modified, into II, but 3179 was not. Nor was it incorporated by reference; II (L) made applicable only those administrative and general tax provisions \"not inconsistent with the provisions of this section,\" and 3179 was obviously inconsistent with II (F).\n\nThe Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 775, and the Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 300, 325, offer further evidence that Congress withdrew the income tax from the reach of the general provisions of 3179. Both of those Acts imposed income taxes, proscribed the making of false returns as a misdemeanor, and punished that offense more severely \n\n[353 \nU.S. 373, 377]\n\u00a0\n than did 3179.\n3\n In addition to its specific prohibition of false returns, the 1917 Act made it an offense to evade or attempt to evade taxes imposed by it, thereby using for the first time language similar to that subsequently found in 145 (b).\n\nIn an effort to escape the effect of the scheme for punishing income tax evaders set forth in the 1913, 1916, and 1917 statutes, petitioner claims that the Revenue Act of 1918 made 3179 again applicable to the income tax. Section 253 of Title II, the income tax title, provided in pertinent part:\n\n \"Any individual . . . who willfully refuses to pay  or collect such [required] tax, to make such return,  or to supply such information at the time or times  required under this title, or who willfully attempts  in any manner to defeat or evade the tax imposed  by this title, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and  shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned  for not more than one year, or both . . . .\" 40 Stat.  1057, 1085.\n\n\n Despite 253's addition of the words \"in any manner\" to the \"attempts\" clause of the 1917 Act, petitioner contends that the failure of 253 to single out the making of false returns with intent to evade must be attributed to a congressional determination that this particular mode of income tax evasion should be punished under 3179. Plainly enough, such a reading of the Act is untenable. We cannot hold that the classic method of evading the income tax, the filing of a false return, did not constitute an attempt \"in any manner to defeat or evade\" that tax. This would empty those words of their most obvious content \n\n[353 \nU.S. 373, 378]\n\u00a0\n and would produce glaring incongruities. It would mean that Congress, having manifested its desire in the previous revenue laws to punish this offense more harshly than did 3179, inexplicably reversed itself in an Act that heavily increased the punishment for all other forms of obstruction to the income tax. And it would mean that Congress provided a lesser penalty for the making of false returns with intent to evade than for either wilful refusal to file, which is usually considered to be a lesser offense, or refusal to file when combined with affirmative acts of evasion such as keeping a double set of books. An explanation of the omission more in harmony with the rational system of tax administration that was the congressional design is that Congress merely tried to speak economically in 1918 and, having prohibited \"attempts in any manner\" to evade the income tax, found it unnecessary also to proscribe the major kind of attempt.\n\nThis interpretation gains further support from the Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 343, which made the last significant alteration of the statutory scheme prior to the 1939 codification. Section 1017 (a), subsequently 145 (a) of the Code, continued the wilful failure to make returns, supply information or pay taxes as a misdemeanor carrying a penalty of up to one year in prison and a $10,000 fine. Section 1017 (b), the future 145 (b), made it a felony, with a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine, to attempt \"in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this Act.\" And 1017 (c), later 3793 (b) (1) of the Code, created a new offense, which made it a felony, with a maximum penalty of five years in prison and $10,000 fine, for any person wilfully to assist in the preparation of a false return. Thus the 1924 Act, by increasing the punishment for affirmative acts of evasion, made even more pronounced one of the indicated anomalies that petitioner's view would impose. In addition, 1017 (c) requires petitioner to impute to Congress \n\n[353 \nU.S. 373, 379]\n\u00a0\n a desire to punish one who assisted in preparing a false return much more severely than one who actually made the return with intent to evade.\n\nOur duty is to give coherence to what Congress has done within the bounds imposed by a fair reading of legislation. In Spies v. United States, \n317 \nU.S. 492\n, the dominant consideration in the Court's unanimous decision relating 145 (b) to 145 (a) was the avoidance of incongruities analogous to those that would result from petitioner's reading of the sections before us. The evolution of those sections makes clear that by the time the unconfined language of 3179 became 3616 (a) of the 1939 Code, its scope had been shrunk by a series of specific enactments that had the potency of implied repeals. Due regard for appropriate statutory construction calls for such a conclusion in order to harmonize an earlier, generalized statute with later ad hoc enactments expressly directed to the collection of income taxes.\n\nIn view of our conclusion that 3616 (a) did not apply to evasion of the income tax, it becomes unnecessary to consider other contentions advanced by petitioner.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE CLARK concur in the result.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"SEC. 145.

The 1917 Act provided, in addition to the maximum penalties set forth in 3179, a penalty of double the tax evaded.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\nI do not see how we can say that Congress withdrew the income tax from the reach of 3616 (a). In the 1939 Internal Revenue Code that section was part of Subchapter B, \"Determination of Tax Liability,\" which was a part of Chapter 34, \"Information and Returns,\" which in turn was part of Subtitle D, \"General Administrative Provisions.\" Section 61 made applicable to the income tax \n\n[353 \nU.S. 373, 380]\n\u00a0\n provisions \"All administrative, special, or stamp provisions of law, including the law relating to the assessment of taxes, so far as applicable . . . .\" These administrative provisions include the chapter and subtitle of which 3616 (a) is a part. And by its terms 3616 (a) applies to \"any\" return. Plainly then, Congress in 1939 considered 3616 (a) an instrument for enforcing the income tax.\n\nIt takes mental gymnastics to bring this crime out from under 3616 (a) and to place it exclusively under 145 (b). I would not make the penal consequences of an Act turn on a construction so tenuous. I rebel against it, especially because the construction now adopted sweeps the ground out from under dozens of criminal convictions which the Government has obtained under 3616 (a). Between October 1952 and March 1957 (when the Government first suggested to this Court that 3616 (a) was inapplicable to the income tax), it invoked 3616 (a) in 175 cases of alleged income tax evasion. It chose 3616 (a), rather than 145 (b), where it appeared that the crime was a relatively minor one. Of these 175 cases, 38 remain undisposed of. Of the 133 that went to trial, 117 resulted in pleas of guilty and 9 in pleas of nolo contendere. Seven defendants went to trial, of whom 5 were acquitted and 2 convicted. Of the 128 convicted persons, 26 were sentenced to imprisonment, the rest being fined or given probation or suspended sentences. Seven of the convicted persons who were sentenced are still incarcerated.\n\nNow it appears that the Government dealt unlawfully with this group of citizens. Those who were convicted on indictments might have to be resentenced. Those who were convicted on informations must be released.\n\nIt is no answer to say that the result is \"a break\" for these defendants. From the statistics submitted to us by the Government it appears that many of these cases \n\n[353 \nU.S. 373, 381]\n\u00a0\n were so minor it is difficult to imagine a grand jury returning indictments on them.\n\nI would adhere to the administrative construction that 3616 (a) applied to the income tax. Congress apparently was of that view. For when it came to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, it re-enacted 3616 (a) as 7207, eliminating the words \"with intent to defeat or evade\" which had caused the overlap with 145 (b). Congress acted, of course, prospectively.\n\nThe fact that Congress acted in 1954 to remove the ambiguity with which we deal today indicates that what we do is not within the judicial competence. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 373, 382]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nADAMS NEWARK THEATER CO. v.

TEXAS(1957)\nNo. 139\nArgued: October 23, 1957Decided: November 12, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In a Texas state court, petitioner was convicted of murdering his wife and was sentenced to death. At his trial, he admitted the killing but claimed it occurred in a fit of passion when he discovered his wife, whom he had already suspected of marital infidelity, kissing another man late at night in a parked car. Had this claim been accepted by the jury, it could have found him guilty of \"murder without malice\" which, under a Texas statute, was punishable by a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. The other man testified at the trial that his relationship with petitioner's wife was nothing more than a casual friendship and that he had simply driven her home from work a few times. In a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding, the other man confessed to having had sexual intercourse with petitioner's wife on several occasions and testified that he had informed the prosecutor of this before the trial and that the prosecutor had told him he should not volunteer any information about it. The prosecutor admitted that these statements were true. Petitions for writs of habeas corpus were denied both by the trial court and by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Held: Petitioner was denied due process of law; the judgment denying a writ of habeas corpus is reversed; and the cause is remanded. Pp. 28-32.\n\n Reversed and remanded.\n\nFred A. Semaan and Raul Villarreal argued the cause, and Mr. Semaan filed a brief, for petitioner.\n\nRoy R. Barrera and Hubert W. Green, Jr. argued the cause for respondent. With them on the brief was Will Wilson, Attorney General of Texas.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nPetitioner, Alvaro Alcorta, was indicted for murder in a Texas state court for stabbing his wife to death. Vernon's Tex. Pen. Code, 1948, Art. 1256. He admitted the killing but claimed it occurred in a fit of passion when \n\n[355 \nU.S. 28, 29]\n\u00a0\n he discovered his wife, whom he had already suspected of marital infidelity, kissing one Castilleja late at night in a parked car. Petitioner relied on Texas statutes which treat killing under the influence of a \"sudden passion arising from an adequate cause . . . as would commonly produce a degree of anger, rage, resentment, or terror in a person of ordinary temper sufficient to render the mind incapable of cool reflection\" as murder without malice punishable by a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. Vernon's Tex. Pen. Code, 1948, Arts. 1257a, 1257b, 1257c. The jury, however, found him guilty of murder with malice and, acting under broad statutory authority to determine the extent of punishment, sentenced him to death. The judgment and sentence were affirmed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. 165 Tex. Cr. R. ___, 294 S. W. 2d 112.\n\nCastilleja, the only eye witness to the killing, testified for the State at petitioner's trial. In response to inquiries by the prosecutor about his relationship with the petitioner's wife, Castilleja said that he had simply driven her home from work a couple of times, and in substance testified that his relationship with her had been nothing more than a casual friendship. He stated that he had given her a ride on the night she was killed and was parked in front of her home with his car lights out at two o'clock in the morning because of engine trouble. The prosecutor then asked what had transpired between Castilleja and petitioner's wife in the parked car:\n\n \"Q. Did you have a conversation with Herlinda?\n\n\n \"A. Yes; she opened the door. She was going to get off [sic] and, then, she told me to tell my sister to come and pick her up in the morning so she could go to church.\n\n\n \"Q. To tell your sister, Delfina Cabrera, to come pick her up in the morning so she could go to church?\n\n\n \"A. Yes.\" \n\n[355 \nU.S. 28, 30]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n At the conclusion of Castilleja's testimony the following colloquy took place between him and the prosecutor:\n\n \"Q. Natividad [Castilleja], were you in love with Herlinda?\n\n\n \"A. No.\n\n\n \"Q. Was she in love with you?\n\n\n \"A. No.\n\n\n \"Q. Had you ever talked about love?\n\n\n \"A. No.\n\n\n \"Q. Had you ever had any dates with her other than to take her home?\n\n\n \"A. No. Well, just when I brought her from there.\n\n\n \"Q. Just when you brought her from work?\n\n\n \"A. Yes.\"\n\n\n All this testimony was quite plainly inconsistent with petitioner's claim that he had come upon his wife kissing Castilleja in the parked car.\n\nSome time after petitioner's conviction had been affirmed Castilleja issued a sworn statement in which he declared that he had given false testimony at the trial. Relying on this statement petitioner asked the trial court to issue a writ of habeas corpus. He contended that he had been denied a fair trial in violation of State and Federal Constitutions because Castilleja had testified falsely, with the knowledge of the prosecutor, that his relationship with petitioner's wife had been only \"that of a friend and neighbor, and that he had had no `dates,' nor other relations with her, when in truth and in fact the witness had been her lover and paramour, and had had sexual intercourse with her on many occasions . . . .\" Petitioner further alleged that he had no knowledge of this illicit intercourse at the time of his trial.\n\nA hearing was held on the petition for habeas corpus. Castilleja was called as a witness. He confessed having sexual intercourse with petitioner's wife on five or six \n\n[355 \nU.S. 28, 31]\n\u00a0\n occasions within a relatively brief period before her death. He testified that he had informed the prosecutor of this before trial and the prosecutor had told him he should not volunteer any information about such intercourse but if specifically asked about it to answer truthfully. The prosecutor took the stand and admitted that these statements were true. He conceded that he had not told petitioner about Castilleja's illicit intercourse with his wife. He also admitted that he had not included this information in a written statement taken from Castilleja prior to the trial but instead had noted it in a separate record. At the conclusion of the hearing the trial judge denied the petition for habeas corpus. Petitioner then applied to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for a writ of habeas corpus but that court, acting on the record made at the hearing before the trial court, also refused to issue the writ. We granted certiorari, \n353 \nU.S. 972\n. Texas concedes that petitioner has exhausted all remedies available to him under state law.\n\nUnder the general principles laid down by this Court in Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n, and Pyle v. Kansas, \n317 \nU.S. 213\n, petitioner was not accorded due process of law. It cannot seriously be disputed that Castilleja's testimony, taken as a whole, gave the jury the false impression that his relationship with petitioner's wife was nothing more than that of casual friendship. This testimony was elicited by the prosecutor who knew of the illicit intercourse between Castilleja and petitioner's wife. Undoubtedly Castilleja's testimony was seriously prejudicial to petitioner. It tended squarely to refute his claim that he had adequate cause for a surge of \"sudden passion\" in which he killed his wife. If Castilleja's relationship with petitioner's wife had been truthfully portrayed to the jury, it would have, apart from impeaching his credibility, tended to corroborate petitioner's contention that he had found his wife embracing \n\n[355 \nU.S. 28, 32]\n\u00a0\n Castilleja. If petitioner's defense had been accepted by the jury, as it might well have been if Castilleja had not been allowed to testify falsely, to the knowledge of the prosecutor, his offense would have been reduced to \"murder without malice\" precluding the death penalty now imposed upon him.\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Criminal Appeals of the State of Texas for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 28, 33]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALLEGHANY CORP. v. BRESWICK & CO.(1957)\nNo. 36\nArgued: Decided: April 22, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In a suit by appellees, who are minority common stockholders of Alleghany Corporation (an investment company), a three-judge District Court set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission granting Alleghany the status of a non-carrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" under 5 (2) and 5 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act and approving Alleghany's issuance of new preferred stock convertible into common stock. It also enjoined Alleghany from issuing the new preferred stock. The Commission's orders were based on its holding that Alleghany, being in control of the New York Central Railroad, needed Commission approval under 5 (2) to merge one subsidiary of the New York Central into another. Held:\n\n 1. As common stockholders whose equity might be \"diluted\" by the issuance of the new preferred stock, appellees had sufficient financial interest to give them standing to sue to set aside the Commission's orders. Pp. 159-160.\n\n\n 2. Since the Commission's order conferring on Alleghany the status of a non-carrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" gave the Commission jurisdiction to approve the preferred stock issue, appellees could attack that order. P. 160.\n\n\n 3. The Commission had jurisdiction over Alleghany under 5 (2) and 5 (3). Pp. 160-172.\n\n\n  (a) It is unnecessary to decide whether Commission approval of acquisition of control of a single integrated railroad system is required; if Alleghany in fact controlled Central, that was sufficient to meet the statutory requirement of \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers.\" Pp. 161-162. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 152]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (b) The Commission's findings amply support its conclusion that \"control\" of Central was in Alleghany. Pp. 162-165.\n\n\n  (c) The Commission was justified in finding that the merger of one of Central's subsidiaries into another involved an \"acquisition of control\" of a \"carrier\" by Central and Alleghany within the meaning of 5 (2). Pp. 165-171.\n\n\n  (d) The failure to join two stockholders alleged to control Alleghany did not oust the Commission of jurisdiction. Pp. 171-172.\n\n\n 4. Appellees were not entitled to a hearing in the proceedings in which the Commission approved the merger of two of Central's subsidiaries and granted Alleghany the status of a non-carrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" under 5 (2), since they were not \"interested parties\" within the meaning of 5 (2) (b). Pp. 172-175.\n\n\n  (a) The fact that appellees were common stockholders of Alleghany is insufficient \"interest,\" since that proceeding had no special effect on appellees and did not pose any individualized threat to their welfare. P. 174.\n\n\n  (b) That assertion of jurisdiction by the Commission would deprive appellees of the benefits of the Investment Company Act of 1940 did not give them sufficient \"interest\" in that proceeding. Pp. 174-175.\n\n\n 5.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese are direct appeals under 28 U.S.C. 1253 from a final judgment of a three-judge District Court for the Southern District of New York setting aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission and restraining appellant Alleghany Corporation from issuing a new class of preferred stock that had been approved by the Commission. The case raises numerous questions regarding the jurisdiction and powers of the Commission, especially under 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, for the understanding of which a rather detailed statement of the facts is necessary.\n\nSection 5 (2) (a), in its pertinent portions, provides: \"It shall be lawful, with the approval and authorization \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 154]\n\u00a0\n of the Commission . . . (i) . . . for a person which is not a carrier to acquire control of two or more carriers through ownership of their stock or otherwise; or for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise . . . .\" 54 Stat. 899, 905, 49 U.S.C. 5 (2) (a).\n1\n\u00a0\n\nAppellant Alleghany Corporation is a Maryland corporation whose charter provides for extensive powers of investment under no express limitation. After the passage of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 789, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq., Alleghany registered as an investment company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 1944, in connection with an application by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad for approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission of acquisition of the property of the Norfolk Terminal & Transportation Company, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 155]\n\u00a0\n Alleghany, alleging that it controlled the Chesapeake & Ohio, filed a supplementary application with the Commission joining the Chesapeake & Ohio's application and seeking approval of its own acquisition of control of the Terminal Company through the action of the Chesapeake & Ohio. In 1945, the Commission approved \"acquisition of control\" of the Terminal Company by the Chesapeake & Ohio and Alleghany as a transaction within 5 (2) and further found that Alleghany \"shall be considered as a carrier subject to the [reporting and securities] provisions of section 20 (1) to (10) and section 20a (2) to (11) of the act.\" 261 I. C. C. 239, 262.\n\nShortly thereafter, under the provisions of 3 (c) (9) of the Investment Company Act,\n2\n the Securities and Exchange Commission held that Alleghany was no longer an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. 20 S. E. C. 731.\n\nIn March, April, and May 1954, several petitions and complaints were filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission by the New York Central Railroad, a stockholder, a protective committee, and bondholder creditors of the Central, asserting violations of the law in Alleghany's purchases of New York Central stock. In view of statements by Alleghany and Chesapeake & Ohio officials that Alleghany had disposed of its holdings of Chesapeake stock, that Commission, in June, ordered Alleghany to show cause why the 1945 order providing that Alleghany \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 156]\n\u00a0\n should be \"considered as a carrier\" should not be set aside. Alleghany replied that it would accept an order terminating its control of the Chesapeake & Ohio but requested delay until it could file a new application which, it alleged, would require the Commission's approval and continuance of its status as a non-carrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" under the Interstate Commerce Act.\n\nThe present proceedings were commenced by the filing of such an application by Alleghany and Central - after the ousting of the old Central management in May in a proxy fight. The contents of the application were described fully in the Report of Division 4 of the Commission:\n\n \"The Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company [the Big Four], the Louisville & Jeffersonville Bridge and Railroad Company [the Bridge Company or the Jeffersonville], The New York Central Railroad Company, and the Alleghany Corporation . . . on September 20, 1954, jointly applied under section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act . . . for approval and authorization of (1) (a) merger of the properties and franchises of the Jeffersonville into the Big Four for ownership, management, and operation; and (b) modification of the lease of January 2, 1930, under which Central, as lessee, operates the property of Big Four, lessor, to give effect to the acquisition of additional property pursuant to the proposed merger of Jeffersonville into Big Four; (2) acquisition by Central and Alleghany, by virtue of their control of Big Four, of control of the properties of Jeffersonville; and (3) continuation of Alleghany's status as a carrier subject to the provisions of section 20 (1) to (10), inclusive, and 20a (2) to (11), inclusive, of the act, as provided by section 5 (3) .thereof.\" 290 I. C. C. 725-726. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 157]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Big Four already owned all the capital stock of the Jeffersonville. The Big Four itself had ceased to be an operating carrier in 1930; since then the New York Central has operated it as lessee. In addition, the New York Central owns 98.98% of the common, and 86.45% of the preferred, stock of the Big Four.\n\nOn March 2, 1955, Division 4 of the Commission approved and authorized the merger of the Jeffersonville into the Big Four; approved continued control of the properties and franchises of the Jeffersonville by the Central and Alleghany; modified the lease between the Big Four and the Central; continued Alleghany as a non-carrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" subject to the reporting and securities provisions of the Act; and terminated the effective portions of the 1945 order in the Chesapeake & Ohio proceeding. 290 I. C. C. 725.\n\nOn reconsideration, the whole Commission on May 24, 1955, affirmed the conclusions of Division 4. It held that Alleghany had acquired control over Central; that at the time the present application was filed, Alleghany was in fact \"a person not a carrier which controlled an established system\"; that the acquisition of control over the Central was not within 5 (2)'s requirement of Commission approval; that the rearrangement by Central of its ownership or control of its subsidiaries was within 5 (2)'s requirement of approval by the Commission and that Alleghany as the controlling party was a necessary party; and that the terms and conditions of the transactions were fair and reasonable. Rejecting the suggestion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had intervened, the whole Commission also held that it had no discretion to yield jurisdiction over Alleghany to the former agency.\n3\n 295 I. C. C. 11. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 158]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSubsequent to their application with respect to the Jeffersonville, Alleghany and Central, on December 17, 1954, filed an application under 5 (2) to \"acquire control\" of the Boston & Albany Railroad Company, the Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad Corporation, and the Ware River Railroad Company through purchase by Central of their capital stock. The Central owned a little more than 16% of the Pittsfield's capital stock and none of the capital stock of the other two railroads. It operated the properties of the Boston & Albany, the Pittsfield, and the Ware River under leases due to expire in 1999, 1975, and 2873 respectively. On March 22, 1955, less than three weeks after it had approved the application in the Jeffersonville proceeding, Division 4 of the Commission approved the acquisition of such control by Alleghany and Central. (Opinion not reported.)\n\nA third application filed by Alleghany, on February 18, 1955, sought permission from the Commission to issue a new 6% convertible preferred stock pursuant to a charter amendment, approved by all classes of Alleghany's stockholders, that permitted consummation of Alleghany's proposed plan of allowing its outstanding cumulative 5 1\/2% preferred stock to be exchanged for the new stock. On May 26, 1955, two days after the whole Commission affirmed Division 4's orders in the Jeffersonville proceeding, Division 4 approved the new stock issue (conditioning its approval on modification of one term), and on June 22, the full Commission denied reconsideration.\n\nAn action was then brought before a three-judge District Court by minority common stockholders of Alleghany to require the Commission to set aside its order granting Alleghany the status of a non-carrier to be \"considered \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 159]\n\u00a0\n as a carrier\" and its subsequent order approving the new class of preferred stock and to restrain Alleghany from issuing the new preferred stock. The three-judge District Court, convened under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, 28 U.S.C. 1336, 1337, 2321-2325, granted first a preliminary injunction, 134 F. Supp. 132 (Circuit Judge Hincks, dissenting), and then a permanent injunction setting aside the Commission's order designating Alleghany as a \"carrier\" and also its order approving Alleghany's new class of preferred stock, restraining its issue. 138 F. Supp. 123.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nAlleghany moved for a new trial based on the \"acquisition of control\" involved in the Boston & Albany proceeding. The District Court held that the Commission's order in that proceeding gave no validity to the orders in the Jeffersonville proceeding because of the Commission's failure to provide specifically in its Boston & Albany order that Alleghany should be \"considered as a carrier.\" 138 F. Supp., at 138. On appeal here from the final judgment below, we noted probable jurisdiction. \n351 \nU.S. 903, 352\n U.S. 816.\n\nAlleghany urges initially that the Commission's orders dealing with its status under the Interstate Commerce Act and dealing with its new preferred stock were not reviewable at the suit of appellees, that appellees had no standing. We find that appellees do have standing to challenge these orders. This is not a case where \"the order under attack does not deal with the interests of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 160]\n\u00a0\n investors,\" or where the \"injury feared is the indirect harm which may result to every stockholder from harm to the corporation.\" Pittsburgh & W. Va. R. Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 479, 487\n. The appellees are common stockholders of Alleghany. The new preferred stock issue approved by the Commission is convertible, and under relevant notions of standing, the threatened \"dilution\" of the equity of the common stockholders provided sufficient financial interest to give them standing. See American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, \n325 \nU.S. 385, 388\n-389.\n\nHaving acquired standing to institute proceedings in the District Court by virtue of the threatened financial injury, appellees could also attack the order of the Commission conferring on Alleghany the status of a person not a carrier but to be \"considered as a carrier.\" The status order was a source of the threatened financial injury. If the Commission acted out of bounds in decreeing its status order, it had no power to approve the new preferred stock issue and the plaintiffs would be entitled to relief.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThis brings us to the substantive issues in the litigation. In the main, these involve the jurisdiction of the Commission \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 161]\n\u00a0\n under 5 (2) and 5 (3) of the Act, defining its powers.\n6\n The validity of the status order under 5 (3) turns on compliance with the statutory requirement of 5 (2) of Commission approval \"for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise . . . .\" Appellants Alleghany and the Commission contend that the Jeffersonville and the Boston & Albany transactions both support the Commission's assertion of jurisdiction. The District Court disagreed with respect to the former and, as we have seen, p. 159, supra, found it unnecessary to pass on the latter.\n\nWhether the Jeffersonville transaction met the statutory requirement of 5 (2) raises three questions. (1) Was Commission approval of Alleghany's acquisition of control over Central required? (2) Did Alleghany in fact control Central? (3) Did the Jeffersonville transaction involve an acquisition of control by Alleghany over the properties of the Jeffersonville?\n\nThe District Court held that whatever control Alleghany had over Central did not fit within the statutory requirement of \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers\" because the Commission had not given the approval necessary for acquisition of control of Central and its subsidiaries, \"two or more carriers.\"\n\nThe Commission and Alleghany contend that Commission approval of the acquisition of a single, integrated system is not necessary. We need not decide this question, however, and intimate no opinion on it, for even if such approval is necessary, the statutory requirement of \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers\" refers to \"control\" and not \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 162]\n\u00a0\n to \"approved control.\" There seems to be no reason to read in the word \"approved.\" Such a holding would mean that the failure of a company engaging in a transaction requiring Commission approval to apply for that approval would deprive the Commission of jurisdiction. Remedies against a violator are provided by 5 (7), (8), and (9) of the Act. To punish a violator by depriving the Commission of jurisdiction over it would be indeed quixotic. As the Commission points out, the problem would appear clearer were Alleghany contesting, rather than acquiescing in, its jurisdiction.\n\nControl in fact then is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of 5 (2). Division 4 of the Commission reported the following:\n\n  \"The capital stock of Central is widely held by the public, but control of its functions reposes in Alleghany and its officers as a result of a proxy contest preceding a stockholders' meeting of May 26, 1954, at which the nominees chosen by Alleghany were elected as Central's board of directors. Alleghany has an undivided half interest in 600,000 shares of Central stock with voting rights to the 600,000 shares under joint-venture agreements, and in addition, owns 15,500 shares. The voting rights of Alleghany represent almost 10 percent of the total shares of Central stock outstanding. The chairman of the board of directors of Alleghany, who holds the same position with Central, beneficially owns 100,200 shares of the latter's stock. The president of Alleghany is a director of Central, and beneficially owns 300,100 shares of the latter's stock. A vice president of Alleghany holds a similar position with Central.\" 290 I. C. C., at 727.\n\n\n Division 4 recognized that \"the present control of the Central system has passed to Alleghany by regular corporate procedures . . . .\" Id., at 741. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 163]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe full Commission reached this conclusion:\n\n  \"The contention that Alleghany does not control the individual directors on Central's board ignores the realities of the situation. Alleghany and its allied interests have succeeded in electing sufficient members of the board to permit them to organize and elect their own officers. Clearly the tenure in office of such directors who permitted this action depends upon their conformance to the views of the stockholders who elected them. In our opinion the power thus reposing in Alleghany constitutes control of Central.\" 295 I. C. C. 11, 16.\n\n\n The District Court, however, held that \"if the Commission's opinions contain a conclusion that Alleghany is in control of New York Central, those opinions lack sufficient findings to support that conclusion.\" 134 F. Supp., at 147. It noted that the order of Division 4 \"discloses the fact that Alleghany's beneficial holdings of the Central stock are less than the combined individual holdings of Kirby, Young, Richardson and the Murchison group,\" and concluded that \"the findings do no more than say that Alleghany, with someone else, controls New York Central. They do not even say whether the someone else, alone, has control.\" Ibid.\n\nWe think that the District Court took too restricted a view of what constitutes \"control.\" In 1939, in Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 145\n-146, arising under the Federal Communications Act, 48 Stat. 1064, 1065, 47 U.S.C. 152 (b), this Court rejected artificial tests for \"control,\" and left its determination in a particular case as a practical concept to the agency charged with enforcement.\n7\n This was the broad scope \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 164]\n\u00a0\n designed for \"control\" as employed by Congress in the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 899-900, 49 U.S.C. 1 (3) (b).\n8\n See United States v. Marshall Transport Co., \n322 \nU.S. 31, 38\n.\n\nThat Act also added 1 (3) (b) to the Interstate Commerce Act, providing:\n\n\"For the purposes of [section] 5 . . . of this Act, where reference is made to control (in referring to a relationship between any person or persons and another person or persons), such reference shall be construed to include actual as well as legal control, whether maintained or exercised through or by reason of the method of or circumstances surrounding organization or operation, through or by common directors, officers, or stockholders, a voting trust or trusts, a holding or investment company or companies, or through or by any other direct or indirect \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 165]\n\u00a0\n means; and to include the power to exercise control.\" 54 Stat. 899-900, 49 U.S.C. 1 (3) (b).\n\n\n Section 1 (3) (a) provides:\n\n\"The term `person' as used in this part includes an individual, firm, copartnership, corporation, company, association, or joint-stock association; and includes a trustee, receiver, assignee, or personal representative thereof.\" 54 Stat. 899, 49 U.S.C. 1 (3) (a).\n\n\n The Commission's findings, setting forth the events surrounding the proxy fight for control of Central, the common directors in both, the stockholdings of Alleghany's officers and stockholders in Central, and the sworn statement of Central in the Central-Alleghany application that Central is controlled by Alleghany amply support its conclusion that \"control\" of Central was in Alleghany. See footnote 7, supra.\n\nThe question remains whether the second portion of the statutory requirement of Commission approval \"for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise . . .\" has been met. What constitutes an acquisition of control? The District Court gave this restricted interpretation:\n\n \"A merger of carriers may involve an acquisition of control by a non-carrier, where, through the merger, the non-carrier acquires control (direct or indirect) of a carrier or carrier property which the non-carrier had previously not controlled; United States v. Marshall Transport Co., \n322 \nU.S. 31\n . . . . But where, as in the instant case, the non-carrier (Alleghany) is (according to our assumption, arguendo) already in indirect control of a carrier (Bridge Company), and the merger still leaves the non-carrier \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 166]\n\u00a0\n in indirect control of such property, no acquisition by the non-carrier results from the merger. . . .\" 138 F. Supp., at 127-128.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n We think that this is too narrow a reading of the statute. Not labels but the nature of the changed relation is crucial in determining whether a rearrangement within a railroad system constitutes an \"acquisition of control\" under 5 (2).\n\nThe Court has already considered twice what constitutes an \"acquisition of control\" under the Interstate Commerce Act. In New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12\n, the Court interpreted 5 (2) as it read in the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 456, 481:\n\n\"Whenever the Commission is of opinion . . . that the acquisition, to the extent indicated by the Commission, by one of such carriers of the control of any other such carrier or carriers either under a lease or by the purchase of stock or in any other manner not involving the consolidation of such carriers into a single system for ownership and operation, will be in the public interest, the Commission shall have authority by order to approve and authorize such acquisition, under such rules and regulations and for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Commission to be just and reasonable in the premises.\"\n\n\n In that case the order of the Commission permitting the New York Central Railroad to acquire control, by lease, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 167]\n\u00a0\n of the railroad systems of the Big Four and the Michigan Central Railroad Companies, was under review. Minority stockholders contended, inter alia, that the Commission could not authorize \"acquisition of control\" by lease since the Central had already acquired control of both railroads by stock ownership. The Court held that the \"disjunctive phrasing of the statute `either under a lease or by the purchase of stock' must be read in the light of its obvious purpose and cannot be taken to mean that one method must be exclusive of the other.\" \n287 \nU.S., at 23\n. Nowhere did it intimate that the lease was not an \"acquisition of control,\" even though the Central already had stock ownership control of both railroads. In fact, the refusal to set aside the Commission's order necessarily involved approval of the Commission's finding of an \"acquisition of control,\" and the Court further stated:\n\n\"The public interest is served by economy and efficiency in operation. If the expected advantages are inadequately secured by stock ownership and would be better secured by lease, the statute affords no basis for the contention that the latter may not be authorized although the former exists. The fact that one precedes the other cannot be regarded as determinative if the desired coordination is not otherwise obtainable.\" Ibid.\n\n\n The Transportation Acts of 1933, 48 Stat. 211, and 1940, 54 Stat. 898, rewrote 5 but retained the \"acquisition of control\" language, except that the phrase relating to method of acquisition - \"under a lease or by the purchase of stock or in any other manner not involving the consolidation of such carriers into a single system\" - became, for acquisitions by both carriers and non-carriers, an all-inclusive phrase in the 1940 Act - \"through ownership of their stock or otherwise.\" These changes do not lessen the authority of the New York Central Securities case in the scope to be given to an \"acquisition of control.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 168]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn United States v. Marshall Transport Co., \n322 \nU.S. 31\n, the Court interpreted 5, as amended by the 1940 Act, 54 Stat. 899, 905, 49 U.S.C. 5. The Court held that the non-carrier parent (Union) of a carrier (Refiners) that proposed to purchase the property and franchises of another carrier (Marshall) \"acquired control\" of the property and franchises of the vendor and was therefore subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. The substantive issues in that case were of course different from those of the present case, since there had been no prior relation between the non-carrier parent and the vendor-carrier. In reaching its decision, however, the Court was explicit regarding the purpose of 5:\n\n \"It is not doubted that if Union, having control of Refiners, sought to acquire stock control of Marshall, Union would be required by 5 (2) (b) to apply for the Commission's authority to do so. But it is said that having control of Refiners, Union may, by procuring Refiners' compliance with the purchase provisions of the statute alone, extend its control indefinitely to other carriers merely by directing the purchase of their property and business by Refiners, without subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of the Commission as provided in 5 (3), so long as Union does not act directly as the purchaser of the property or of a controlling stock interest in such other carriers.\n\n\n \"We think that neither the language nor the legislative history of the statute admits of so narrow a construction. Section 5 (4) makes it unlawful, without the approval of the Commission as provided by  5 (2) (a), for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise. Not only is this language broad \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 169]\n\u00a0\n enough in terms to embrace the acquisition of control by a non-carrier through the purchase, by a controlled carrier, of the property and business of another carrier, but the legislative history indicates that such was its purpose.\" Id., at 36-37. See also id., at 37-40.\n\n\n In other words, a non-carrier may not gain \"control\" over carriers free of Commission regulation merely by operating through subsidiaries.\n\nThe crux of each inquiry to determine whether there has been an \"acquisition of control\" is the nature of the change in relations between the companies whose proposed transaction is before the Commission for approval. Does the transaction accomplish a significant increase in the power of one over the other, for example, an increased voice in management or operation, or the ability to accomplish financial transactions or operational changes with greater legal ease? This is the issue, and not the immediacy or remoteness of the parent from the proposed transaction, for, as we said in the Marshall Transport case, the parent can always, by operating through subsidiaries, make itself more remote. In deciding this type of issue, of course, the finding of the Commission that a given transaction does or does not constitute a significant increase in the power of one company over another is not to be overruled so long as \"there is warrant in the record for the judgment of the expert body . . . .\" Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 146\n.\n\nThe principal issue, therefore, in the Jeffersonville proceeding is not Alleghany's remoteness from, or closeness to, the proposed transaction but rather the nature of the proposed transaction itself. The Big Four, whose stock was largely owned by Central, owned all the stock of the Jeffersonville. (By agreement between the Big Four and the Central, this stock was held by the Central.) The proposal was to merge the Jeffersonville into the Big \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 170]\n\u00a0\n Four. While the immediate practical effects of the merger on the operation of the Jeffersonville might be small, even minimal, a merger is the ultimate in one company obtaining control over another. So long as the Jeffersonville existed as a separate company, there was always the possibility that the Big Four, through the Central, might sell, or be forced to divest itself of, the Jeffersonville stock, and that the control of the Jeffersonville might thus pass to another railroad. In considering this possibility, it is important to note that the Jeffersonville does not connect physically with the Big Four but connects with it only by virtue of the Big Four's trackage rights over the Baltimore & Ohio, and that the Jeffersonville, with its few miles of track, also connects with the Pennsylvania, Baltimore & Ohio, Louisville & Nashville, Illinois Central, and Chesapeake & Ohio Railroads.\n\nThe merger of the Jeffersonville into the Big Four virtually precludes any change in the relation of the Jeffersonville lines to the Central system. The Jeffersonville will be no more. In view of this, it cannot reasonably be said that there has been no increase in the power of the Big Four, the Central, and, through its relation with them, Alleghany over the Jeffersonville. While it is not always profitable to analogize \"fact\" to \"fiction,\" La Fontaine's fable of the crow, the cheese, and the fox demonstrates that there is a substantial difference between holding a piece of cheese in the beak and putting it in the stomach.\n\nDenial of power to the Commission to regulate the elimination of the Jeffersonville from the national transportation scene would be a disregard of the responsibility placed on it by Congress to oversee combinations and consolidations of carriers and \"to promote safe, adequate, economical, and efficient service and foster sound economic conditions in transportation and among the several carriers . . .\" and the further requirement that \"All of the provisions of this Act shall be administered \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 171]\n\u00a0\n and enforced with a view to carrying out the above declaration of policy.\" National Transportation Policy, 54 Stat. 899, 49 U.S.C., preceding 1. We hold that the Commission was justified in finding that the merger of the Jeffersonville into the Big Four involved an \"acquisition of control\" of the Jeffersonville by Central and Alleghany within the meaning of 5 (2) of the Act. Since the status order of the Commission is supportable by virtue of the Jeffersonville proceeding, we need not consider the District Court's denial of Alleghany's motion, based on the Boston & Albany proceeding, for a new trial.\n\nSeveral other matters urged by appellees remain to be considered. Appellees contend that Alleghany did not acquire control of any carrier in the Jeffersonville proceeding since the application was made by the Big Four as lessor and the Central as lessee and that therefore the Big Four was a statutory lessor and not a carrier within 5. We need not discuss the distinction that appellees seek to assert between lessors and carriers, for the Jeffersonville, the railroad whose control we have held was acquired by Alleghany, was an operating carrier.\n\nAppellees also urge that the Marshall Transport case, \n322 \nU.S. 31\n, requires dismissal of Alleghany's application because two stockholders, alleged to dominate Alleghany, did not join in the application and therefore in the absence of those two indispensable parties, the Commission had no jurisdiction to proceed. But in the Marshall Transport case, the Commission was refusing to approve a subsidiary's application to acquire control of the property and operating rights of another carrier unless the non-carrier parent submitted itself to the Commission's jurisdiction, and the Court upheld the Commission's power to refuse to approve the application.\n\nAlthough the Court in that case used language of \"jurisdiction,\" the problem is not strictly jurisdictional in the sense that if the Commission wrongly decides that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 172]\n\u00a0\n corporation or person A does not \"control\" non-carrier B (which is \"considered as a carrier\") and therefore that A need not join B's application to acquire control of C, the Commission loses jurisdiction over B, the power to regulate B. The Commission's jurisdiction over a non-carrier depends on whether the activities of the non-carrier fall within 5 (2) and (3) and does not depend on the action of the parent. For example, if Alleghany were contending that it could reshuffle the whole Central system without Commission approval, alleging that the Commission had no jurisdiction over it through failure to join two stockholders controlling it in the original status order proceedings, this whole problem would appear in a clearer context. The basis of the Commission's jurisdiction in the present case is Alleghany's status as \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers,\" seeking permission \"to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise . . . .\" The failure to join two stockholders alleged to control Alleghany does not oust the Commission of jurisdiction. Since that is so, the status order submitting Alleghany to the Commission's jurisdiction cannot be attacked on that basis.\n\nAppellees further argue, and the District Court held, 134 F. Supp., at 147-149 and 138 F. Supp., at 136-137, that under 5 (2) (b) and 17 (3), appellees were entitled to an evidentiary hearing of some sort in the merger-status order proceeding (as distinguished from the subsequent preferred stock proceeding) even though the Commission had discretion to dispense with a \"public hearing.\" Section 5 (2) (b), in its relevant portion, provides:\n\n\"Whenever a transaction is proposed under subparagraph (a) . . . the Commission shall notify the Governor of each State in which any part of the properties of the carriers involved in the proposed \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 173]\n\u00a0\n transaction is situated, and also such carriers and the applicant or applicants . . . and shall afford reasonable opportunity for interested parties to be heard. . . . a public hearing shall be held in all cases where carriers by railroad are involved unless the Commission determines that a public hearing is not necessary in the public interest. . . .\" 54 Stat. 906, as amended, 63 Stat. 485-486, 49 U.S.C. 5 (2) (b).\n\n\n Section 17 (3) provides, in part, that \"All hearings before the Commission, a division, individual Commissioner, or board shall be public upon the request of any party interested.\" 54 Stat. 914, 49 U.S.C. 17 (3).\n\nWe need not determine the bounds of the Commission's power to dispense with, or limit, hearings under 5 (2) (b), for appellees' claim of a right to a hearing in the merger-status order proceeding must fail for another reason - lack of the requisite interest of \"interested parties.\"\n\nThe reference in 5 to \"interested parties,\" like the reference in 1 (20) to \"party in interest,\" must be interpreted in accordance with the rules relevant to standing to become parties in proceedings under the Interstate Commerce Act. A hearing under that Act is not like a legislative hearing and \"interest\" is not equivalent to \"concern.\" It may not always be easy to apply in particular cases the usual formulation of the general principle governing such standing - e. g., \"the complaint must show that plaintiff has, or represents others having, a legal right or interest that will be injuriously affected by the order.\" Moffat Tunnel League v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 113, 119\n. In each case, the sufficiency of the \"interest\" in these situations must be determined with reference to the particular context in which the party seeks to assert its position.\n\nAppellees assert three grounds of interest in the merger-status order proceeding: that they were common stockholders \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 174]\n\u00a0\n of Alleghany, that the assertion of jurisdiction by the Interstate Commerce Commission would deprive them of the benefits of the Investment Company Act, 54 Stat. 789, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq., and that the proposed preferred stock issue was unfair.\n\nThe fact that appellees were common stockholders of Alleghany is insufficient \"interest.\" The proceeding before the Commission was to determine whether the Jeffersonville-Big Four merger was a transaction requiring Commission approval as an acquisition of control by \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers\" of \"another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise . . . .\" 54 Stat. 905, 49 U.S.C. 5 (2) (a) (i). Unlike the subsequent preferred stock order whose threatened financial injury to appellees was sufficient to confer standing to bring the present proceedings, the merger agreement had no special effect on appellees or on common stockholders of Alleghany. See New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 19\n-20. Nor did the proposed status order that Alleghany should be \"considered as a carrier\" and therefore regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission by itself pose any individualized threat to the welfare of the appellees.\n\nReliance on the alleged benefits of protection under the Investment Company Act subtly begs the question. Alleghany would be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act only if the Interstate Commerce Commission lacked jurisdiction to regulate it under 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act. The fact that there may be another Act that gives appellees greater protection as investors is immaterial to the appellees' right to a hearing in the merger-status order proceeding. The question here is whether the proposed transaction falls within the Interstate Commerce Commission's jurisdiction, not what the consequences will be if it does not. No special threat \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 175]\n\u00a0\n to appellees arises from the mere assertion of Commission jurisdiction to regulate Alleghany. When subsequent Commission action in approving the Alleghany's new preferred stock issue did present a special threat to appellees, that provided the \"interest\" sufficient to attack the Commission's jurisdiction in the present proceeding. But this threat could not retroactively confer upon them the right to a hearing in the merger-status order proceeding, in which they had no \"interest.\"\n\nAppellees' claim that they were entitled to a hearing in the preferred stock proceeding is governed by 20a (6) of the Act, which provides that \"The Commission may hold hearings, if it sees fit, to enable it to determine its decision upon the application for authority.\" 41 Stat. 495, 49 U.S.C. 20a (6).\n\nFor all these reasons, the judgment of the District Court must be reversed and the case remanded for consideration by the District Court of appellees' claim, not previously discussed, that the preferred stock issue as approved by the Commission was in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act. This disposition renders it needless to pass on appellees' motion to dismiss in No. 82.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 5 (3) provides: \"Whenever a person which is not a carrier is authorized, by an order entered under paragraph (2), to acquire control of any carrier or of two or more carriers, such person thereafter shall, to the extent provided by the Commission in such order, be considered as a carrier subject to such of the following provisions as are applicable to any carrier involved in such acquisition of control: Section 20 (1) to (10), inclusive, of this part, sections 204 (a) (1) and (2) and 220 of part II, and section 313 of part III, (which relate to reports, accounts, and so forth, of carriers), and section 20a (2) to (11), inclusive, of this part, and section 214 of part II, (which relate to issues of securities and assumptions of liability of carriers), including in each case the penalties applicable in the case of violations of such provisions. In the application of such provisions of section 20a of this part and of section 214 of part II, in the case of any such person, the Commission shall authorize the issue or assumption applied for only if it finds that such issue or assumption is consistent with the proper performance of its service to the public by each carrier which is under the control of such person, that it will not impair the ability of any such carrier to perform such service, and that it is otherwise consistent with the public interest.\" 54 Stat. 907, 49 U.S.C. 5 (3).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), none of the following persons is an investment company within the meaning of this title:\n\n.   .  .  .   .\n\n\n\". . .

The two judges who heard the motion divided, and the motion was therefore denied. On application to Circuit Justice Harlan, a stay was granted with respect to that portion of the new preferred stock that had been issued before the District Court's injunction was granted. 75 S. Ct. 912. The New York Stock Exchange, however, continued to suspend trading in the new preferred stock.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 144\n, where the fact that the \"contested order determining the status of the Rochester necessarily and immediately carried direction of obedience to previously formulated mandatory orders addressed generally to all carriers . . . in conjunction with the other orders, made determination of the status of the Rochester a reviewable order of the Commission.\" Whether reviewability of a status order, without more, be deemed a matter of standing to review or a matter of finality of administrative action, the basis for decision is the same: has the action of the administrative agency threatened the interests of the complainant, whether corporation or, as here, stockholder otherwise qualified to sue, sufficiently to allow attack? (This does not mean of course that the same agency action that allows attack by one allows attack by the other.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] A brief summary of the history of 5 is set forth in St. Joe Paper Co. v.

This is an issue of fact to be determined by the special circumstances of each case. So long as there is warrant in the record for the judgment of the expert body it must stand. The suggestion that the refusal to regard the New York ownership of only one third of the common stock of the Rochester as conclusive of the former's lack of control of the latter should invalidate the Commission's finding, disregards actualities in such intercorporate relations. Having found that the record permitted the Commission to draw the conclusion that it did, a court travels beyond its province to express concurrence therewith as an original question. `The judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions approved by the administrative body.'

(This was the Conference Report.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The United States, which had supported the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the District Court proceedings, on this appeal has taken the position that the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed because the merger of the Jeffersonville into the Big Four did not involve an \"acquisition of control\" over the Jeffersonville by Alleghany.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK concur, dissenting.\n\nAlleghany Corporation, though not a carrier as that term is used in the Interstate Commerce Act, is subject to supervision by the Interstate Commerce Commission, 49 U.S.C. 5 (3), and exempt from the control of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-3 (c) (9), if \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 176]\n\u00a0\n it has the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission to \"acquire control of two or more carriers through ownership of their stock or otherwise.\" 49 U.S.C. 5 (2) (a) (i).\n\n\"Control\" as used in 5 is defined in 1 (3) (b):\n\n \". . . to include actual as well as legal control, whether maintained or exercised through or by reason of the method of or circumstances surrounding organization or operation, through or by common directors, officers, or stockholders, a voting trust or trusts, a holding or investment company or companies, or through or by any other direct or indirect means; and to include the power to exercise control.\"\n\n\n\n\"Control\" thus means \"actual\" as well as \"legal\" control and includes the exercise of \"indirect\" as well as \"direct\" means. It seems obvious, therefore - so obvious as to be beyond the realm of dispute or argument - that if one has \"actual\" control through \"indirect\" means and changes the means whereby he commands that power, he has only retained \"control,\" not acquired it within the meaning of 5 (3). For one who has \"control,\" as defined, does not acquire it when he merely changes the method or means of its exercise. Yet it is clear that Alleghany did no more than that.\n\n\n Alleghany has control of the New York Central.\n\nMost of the stock of the Big Four (Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, & St. Louis R. Co.) is owned by Central. The lines of the Big Four are operated by Central as lessee.\n\nThere is a Bridge Company (the Louisville & Jeffersonville Bridge & R. Co.) whose stock, prior to the transaction about to be discussed, was owned by the Big Four and held by Central under the lease.\n\nAlleghany, Central, the Big Four, and the Bridge Company applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 177]\n\u00a0\n permission to merge the Bridge Company into the Big Four and for Central thereafter to operate the properties of the Bridge Company under the Big Four lease. The merger was an intra-system rearrangement of properties that did not affect one whit Alleghany's \"control\" in the statutory sense of the Bridge Company. Before the merger Alleghany had \"control\" of the Bridge Company. It therefore did not \"acquire control\" but only retained it as a result of the merger.\n\nThere was another transaction which Alleghany says caused it to \"acquire control\" of a carrier within the meaning of 5 (3) and therefore to have a carrier status under the Interstate Commerce Act. Alleghany and Central applied to the Commission for permission to acquire the stock of Boston & Albany R. Co., Pittsfield & North Adams R. Corp., and Ware River R. Co. Central was operating the properties of those three roads under leases - two of the leases being for 99 years each and one for 999 years. The Commission approved this stock acquisition by Central.\n\nThere are two reasons why this transaction did not give Alleghany a carrier status. In the first place, 5 (3) gives a noncarrier the status of a carrier only \"to the extent provided by the Commission in such order.\" The Commission made no such order in connection with the acquisition of the stock of the three New England carriers.\n\nIn the second place Alleghany, through Central, had \"actual control\" of those three carriers prior to the acquisition of their stock. That \"control\" was evident by the long-term leases over the properties of those carriers. Alleghany, therefore, did not \"acquire control\" when Central acquired the stock of the three companies. The form of Alleghany's control changed by the stock acquisition. But the financial master of the three New England carriers was the same before Central acquired \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 178]\n\u00a0\n their stock, as it was afterwards. As stated by the District Court, where a noncarrier is \"already in indirect control of a carrier\" and the transaction relied upon \"still leaves the non-carrier in indirect control of such property, no acquisition by the non-carrier results from the merger.\" 138 F. Supp. 123, 127-128.\n\nThe court that made that ruling had as one of its members the late Judge Frank, who had no superior when it came to an understanding of the ways of high finance and to an analysis of regulatory measures dealing with it. I see no answer to what Judge Frank and his colleagues concluded on this phase of the case.\n\nThat view of 5 (2) is plainly reflected in the legislative history. This control over noncarriers who acquired control of carriers was introduced in 1933. Commissioner Eastman pointed out to Congress the evil which was to be remedied - \"holding companies have been bringing carriers under common control and hence combining them without any supervision or approval by the commission.\"\n1\n The Senate Report stated that the amendment gave the Commission control over holding companies that \"effect consolidations without approval of the commission.\"\n2\n To \"acquire control\" within the meaning of 5 (2) means then to put under common control carriers that previously were separate. We would strain to find a construction which would enable holding companies to run for shelter under the Act merely because, within the system they control, there have been corporate rearrangements or readjustments that change the internal structure of the system.\n\nAlleghany points with alarm to the loopholes in the law that will be created if it is held that Alleghany did not \"acquire\" control in connection with the Bridge \n\n[353 \nU.S. 151, 179]\n\u00a0\n Company merger and the acquisition of the stock of the New England carriers. No loopholes will be created. Central could do neither of those two things without the approval of the Commission, since 5 (2) (a) requires Commission approval of many intra-system transactions by carriers. That is the force of the holding in New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12\n. The loophole that is created comes from granting Alleghany a carrier status. Then Alleghany escapes the far more rigorous supervision which is imposed on it by the Investment Company Act.\n\nThe only other means by which Alleghany could have acquired a carrier status was in connection with financial transactions long since liquidated. Alleghany had a carrier status, granted it by the Interstate Commerce Commission, when it acquired the stock of the Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. and two other carriers. That order, issued in 1945, gave it a carrier status \"unless and until otherwise ordered\" by the Commission. That order was terminated by the Commission on May 24, 1955.\n\nThe approval of the preferred stock issue that is involved in this litigation did not come until later, viz. June 22, 1955. At that time it seems plain that Alleghany had no carrier status and could not obtain one on the basis of the intercorporate transactions on which it relies.\n\nI would affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Hearings, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H.

Pp. 143-144, 147-152.\n\n (a) Section 207 makes no reference to the phrase \"service . . . in its operations\" used in 5 (2) (b), nor is there any language even suggesting a mandatory limitation to service which is auxiliary or supplementary. P. 149.\n\n\n (b) The legislative history of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 gives no indication that 213 (a) (1), the predecessor of 5 (2) (b) of the present Act, was to be considered as a limitation on applications under 207. P. 149.\n\n\n (c) In interpreting 207, the Commission has accepted the policy of 5 (2) (b) as a guiding light, not as a rigid limitation. Pp. 149-150.\n\n\n (d) Congress did not intend the rigid requirement of 5 (2) (b) to be considered as a limitation on certificates issued under 207. P. 150.\n\n\n (e) This holding is not contrary to United States v. Rock Island Motor Transit Co., \n340 \nU.S. 419\n, or United States v. Texas & Pacific Motor Transport Co., \n340 \nU.S. 450\n. P. 151.\n\n\n (f) The underlying policy of 5 (2) (b) must not be divorced from proceedings for new certificates under 207, and the Commission must take \"cognizance\" of the National Transportation Policy and apply the Act \"as a whole\"; but the Commission does \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n not act beyond its statutory authority when in the public interest it occasionally departs from the auxiliary and supplementary limitations in a 207 proceeding. Pp. 151-152.\n\n\n2. \nIn this case, the Commission has not permitted the 207 proceedings to be used as a device to evade the restrictions previously imposed in the acquisition proceedings under 5 (2) (b). P. 152.\n\n3. \nIn this case, the evidence was sufficient to support the Commission's finding of public convenience and necessity and its issuance of the certificate. Pp. 152-154.\n\n (a) Public need for the motor carrier's operation in truckload traffic in this case can be grounded to some extent on the need for its operation in \"peddle traffic,\" since economic justification for carrying on a costly peddle operation depends on combining it with a more lucrative truckload operation. Pp. 153-154.\n\n\n (b) While railroads are not allowed to enter the motor trucking industry primarily to build an independently profitable trucking operation, there is no foundation in the Act for so construing 207 as to require that any railroad operation in the motor trucking field be unprofitable. P. 154.\n\n\n (c) If the unrestricted operations permitted in this case are destructive of competition or otherwise detrimental to the public service, the situation would not be without remedy, since the Commission has reserved continuing jurisdiction which will enable it to make certain that the unlimited certificate issued here does not operate to defeat the National Transportation Policy.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese appeals involve, among subsidiary issues, the basic question of whether the Interstate Commerce Commission in a proceeding under 207 (a)\n1\n of the Interstate Commerce Act, wherein a railroad subsidiary seeks a certificate permitting it to provide ordinary motor carrier service at or near the parent railroad's line, is required by 5 (2) (b)\n2\n of the Act and the National Transportation \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n Policy to restrict such motor carrier service to that which is auxiliary to, or supplemental of, the parent railroad's services. A three-judge District Court sitting in the District of Columbia upheld the action of the Commission in issuing a certificate without such restrictions. 144 F. Supp. 365. We agree with the conclusion of the District Court that under the circumstances of this case the action of the Commission was well founded.\n\nAt the time we noted probable jurisdiction of the appeals, \n352 \nU.S. 816\n (1956), counsel in No. 8 were invited to discuss the issue of appellants' standing to sue. None of the parties now question that standing, and our examination of 17 (11)\n3\n and 205 (h)\n4\n of the Act leads us to conclude that appellants may properly bring this action. See Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Baltimore & O. R. Co., \n331 \nU.S. 519\n (1947).\n\nIn 1938 the Commission authorized Rock Island Motor Transit, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, to purchase the property and operating rights of the White Line Motor Freight Company, between Silvis, Illinois, and Omaha, Nebraska. 5 M. C. C. 451. The operating certificate, issued in 1941, restricted Motor Transit to service to or from points on \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n the Rock Island Railroad, subject to any further restrictions the Commission might impose \"to insure that the service shall be auxiliary or supplementary to the train service. . . .\" No. MC-29130. Three years later the Commission allowed Motor Transit to purchase property and operating rights of the Frederickson Lines, covering routes between Atlantic, Iowa, and Omaha. 39 M. C. C. 824. Prior to issuing an operating certificate for the Frederickson routes, however, the Commission reopened both proceedings and imposed five conditions on Motor Transit's operation over the combined routes.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough Motor Transit succeeded in its efforts to have this order set aside by a three-judge District Court, 90 F. Supp. 516, we upheld on appeal the power of the Commission to impose the conditions, and reversed the order of the District Court. United States v. Rock Island Motor Transit Co., \n340 \nU.S. 419\n (1951). Pursuant to \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n our holding, a certificate was issued in September 1951, containing the restrictions as originally ordered.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nSoon thereafter Motor Transit filed with the Commission the present application for a certification of unrestricted operations. Authority was requested to serve the points along the White Line and Frederickson routes as well as certain off-line points, all of which parallel generally the lines of the parent railroad between Chicago and Omaha. The application was substantially granted in November 1954.\n7\n 63 M. C. C. 91. Operations were authorized, free of the prior conditions, between Silvis, Illinois, and Omaha. The application was denied insofar as it sought authority between Silvis and Chicago; the Commission pointed out that Motor Transit already possessed such authority.\n\nThe order was attacked in the District Court by American Trucking Associations, Inc., its Regular Common Carrier Conference, and nine motor carriers - all appellants in No. 6. The Railway Labor Executives' Association \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 147]\n\u00a0\n and two organizations which since have become members thereof - all of whom are appellants in No. 8 - intervened in opposition to the order. Answers were filed by the United States and the Commission. Intervenors in support of the order included Motor Transit, a committee of its employees, the Iowa State Commerce Commission, and numerous Chambers of Commerce and shipper organizations. These appeals were taken from the order of the District Court upholding the certificate as granted.\n\nAppellants advance three reasons why the order should be stricken. They say, in general, that the Commission is required not only in acquisition proceedings under 5 (2) (b) but also in certification proceedings under 207 to limit service by a rail-owned motor carrier to that which is auxiliary to or supplemental of the rail service of its parent; that the Commission is without power to void restrictions previously imposed in acquisition proceedings on the subterfuge of a subsequent 207 application; and, even if such contentions have no validity, that the evidence was insufficient and the findings inadequate to support the certification order of the Commission.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nBy 5 (2) (b), which was formerly 213 (a) (1) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 555, the Congress authorized consolidation, merger, acquisition, or lease of carriers if found by the Commission to be \"consistent with the public interest.\" However, in transactions involving a motor carrier where a railroad or its affiliate is an applicant, the Congress directed the Commission \"not [to] enter such an order unless it finds that the transaction proposed\" not only is in the public interest but \"will enable such [railroad] carrier to use service by motor vehicle to public advantage in its operations and will not unduly restrain competition.\" The Commission has \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 148]\n\u00a0\n interpreted this mandate of the Congress to confine acquisition of a motor carrier by a railroad or its affiliate to \"operations . . . which are auxiliary or supplementary to train service.\"\n8\n We specifically approved this long administrative practice in United States v. Rock Island Motor Transit Co., supra. It will be remembered that the acquisitions of the White Line and Frederickson routes by Motor Transit, wherein \"auxiliary or supplemental\" restrictions were imposed, were pursuant to this section of the Act.\n\nThe present proceedings, however, were instituted under 206 et seq. of the Act, which involve applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity. Motor Transit had been carrying on scheduled peddle operations over the entire White Line and Frederickson routes regardless of the volume of traffic available. By this application it sought to secure a certificate covering the same general routes without the restrictions imposed in the 5 (2) (b) proceedings. Such a certificate would enable it to haul, inter alia, the more profitable truckload traffic, thus supplementing the expensive peddle service.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 149]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 207, which defines the showing on which issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity is predicated, makes no reference to the phrase \"service . . . in its operations\" used in 5 (2) (b), nor is there any language even suggesting a mandatory limitation to service which is auxiliary or supplementary.\n\nThe legislative history of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 gives no indication that 213 (a) (1), the predecessor of 5 (2) (b), was to be considered a limitation on applications under 207. Congressional debate was largely confined to the subject of acquisitions, and no reference to railroad operation of motor carriers appears in either of the Committee Reports. S. Rep. No. 482, H. R. Rep. No. 1645, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. Certain amendments were proposed in 1938, including one by Senator Shipstead which would have added to 207 the same language which in 213 (a) of the Motor Carrier Act and 5 (2) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act had been construed as a limitation to auxiliary or supplementary service. The Senator withdrew his amendment after Commissioner Eastman of the Interstate Commerce Commission expressed the view that \"in interpreting and applying the provisions of section 207 (a) . . . the Commission should read the act as a whole and take cognizance of this policy\" of restricting certificates to auxiliary or supplementary service. See Hearings before Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 3606, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 26-30, 141-142.\n\nIn interpreting 207, the Commission has accepted the policy of 5 (2) (b) as a guiding light, not as a rigid limitation. While it has applied auxiliary and supplementary restrictions in many 207 proceedings, the Commission has occasionally issued certificates to railroad subsidiaries without the restrictions where \"special circumstances\" prevail, namely, where unrestricted operations by the rail-owned carrier are found on specific facts \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 150]\n\u00a0\n and circumstances to be in the public interest.\n10\n At least three of these cases had been decided when the Congress extensively revised the Interstate Commerce Act by enactment of the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 898, in which 213 of the Motor Carrier Act was substantially re-enacted into 5 (2) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act, while 207 (a) was left unchanged.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that the Congress did not intend the rigid requirement of 5 (2) (b) to be considered as a limitation on certificates issued under 207. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 151]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor is this contrary to our holding in United States v. Rock Island Motor Transit Co., supra, an acquisition case in which the Court also discussed Commission policy under 207. We pointed out that \"[r]ail affiliates have been permitted to leave the line of the railroad to serve communities without other transportation service. Those divergences, however, are an exercise of the discretionary and supervisory power with which Congress has endowed the Commission.\" \n340 \nU.S., at 442\n. We found that the Commission's purpose was to apply the National Transportation Policy so as \"to preserve the inherent advantages of motor-carrier service.\" In discussing this practice we quoted at page 428 from the opinion of the Commission in that case, which stated the test in this language:\n\n\"In other words, a railroad applicant for authority to operate as a common carrier by motor vehicle, though required to do no more than prove, as any other applicant, that its service is required by public convenience and necessity, has a special burden . . . by reason of the very circumstance that it is a railroad. Where it fails to show special circumstances negativing any disadvantage to the public from this fact, a grant of authority to supply motor service other than service auxiliary to and supplemental of train service is not justified.\" 40 M. C. C. 457, 474.\n\n\n In United States v. Texas & Pacific Motor Transport Co., \n340 \nU.S. 450\n (1951), decided on the same day as Rock Island, we upheld the Commission's imposition of restrictions in a 207 case. In Texas & Pacific, however, the proceeding involved the power of the Commission to impose the restrictions, a question not before us here.\n\nWe repeat, as was said in those cases, that the underlying policy of 5 (2) (b) must not be divorced from proceedings for new certificates under 207. Indeed, the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 152]\n\u00a0\n Commission must take \"cognizance\" of the National Transportation Policy and apply the Act \"as a whole.\" But, for reasons we have stated, we do not believe that the Commission acts beyond its statutory authority when in the public interest it occasionally departs from the auxiliary and supplementary limitations in a 207 proceeding.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe find no indications that the Commission has permitted the 207 proceedings in this case to be used as a device to evade 5 (2) (b) restrictions. Certificate proceedings under 207 are separate and distinct from acquisition proceedings, although the same general policy governs both. If the public interest requires that a 207 certificate be issued to a rail-owned carrier without restriction, we find no authority for denying the Commission power to grant the same simply because the carrier just emerged from a 5 (2) (b) proceeding. Moreover, the approval here was expressly subject to the Commission's continuing examination of the activity of Motor Transit with a view of placing limitations on its operations if found necessary in the public interest. A further condition makes all contractual arrangements between Motor Transit and its parent subject to revision by the Commission.\n\nFinally, if under our interpretation a \"loophole\" exists in the Act, the Commission has shown no inclination to permit its use as such. Should the Commission prove to be less stringent in the future, appellants not only have recourse to the Congress, but also to the courts for review of the Commission's finding that \"special circumstances\" exist.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nAppellants' last contention relates to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the Commission's finding of \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 153]\n\u00a0\n public convenience and necessity. Appellants concede that public need may be found for peddle traffic between the smaller points along the routes, but contest the findings of public need for unrestricted service between such major points as Davenport, Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, and Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nThe evidence before the Commission was such that we are not inclined to disturb the findings. Approval of the application was urged by the Iowa State Commerce Commission, 149 shippers and receivers, 8 motor carriers who interline traffic with Motor Transit (including some members of appellant Motor Trucking Association), and several Chambers of Commerce and commercial organizations. There was evidence of a serious need for less-than-truckload peddle service: other carriers frequently failed to handle such traffic, and gave service inferior to that of Motor Transit when they did operate. There was testimony that the weight and key-point limitations operated to make even the Motor Transit service less than adequate. It appeared that the peddle traffic alone was not profitable, and that if confined to it Motor Transit could no longer render the caliber of peddle service it had maintained prior to the imposition of the temporary restrictions. Further, there was evidence that 11 points would be totally without peddle service if the auxiliary and supplemental restrictions were applied. Apart from the effect of restricted operations on peddle service, the record indicates that other carriers sometimes had been reluctant to accept even truckloads in certain low-rated commodities.\n\nThis evidence leaves us unwilling to suggest that public convenience and necessity could only be advanced by confining Motor Transit to service of the smaller communities, while leaving the more profitable business to others. Public need for Motor Transit's operation in truckload traffic to some extent can be grounded on the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 141, 154]\n\u00a0\n need for its operation in peddle traffic, since economic justification for carrying on a costly peddle operation depends on combining it with a more lucrative truckload operation. While it is true that railroads were not allowed to enter the motor trucking industry primarily to build an independently profitable trucking operation, there is no foundation in the Interstate Commerce Act for so construing 207 as to require that any railroad operation in the motor trucking field be unprofitable. Observance of economic realities in ascertaining public need is no less due a rail-owned motor carrier than an independent motor carrier.\n\nIf, as appellants fear, the unrestricted operations are destructive of competition or otherwise detrimental to the public interest, we believe the situation would not be without remedy. The Commission has retained jurisdiction \"to impose in the future whatever restrictions or conditions, if any, appear necessary in the public interest by reason of material changes in conditions or circumstances surrounding applicant's operations in relation to those of competing motor carriers.\" 63 M. C. C., at 108. This reservation gives it continuing jurisdiction to make certain that the unlimited certificate issued here does not operate to defeat the National Transportation Policy.

The special issues claimed to be in conflict with this finding concerned alleged negligence only in the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 360, 361]\n\u00a0\n operation and presence of the truck on this passageway. But even if the rule announced by the Court of Civil Appeals controlled, as we see it these answers present no square conflict. The findings on these special issues do not exhaust all of the possible grounds on which the prior unsafe-place-to-work finding of the jury may have been based. Hence all of the findings in the case might well be true insofar as the record indicates. The petitioner having asserted federal rights governed by federal law, it is our duty under the Act to make certain that they are fully protected, as the Congress intended them to be.

Insofar as review of the decision of the Texas court involves the question of an inconsistency between the general verdict and the special findings on the central issue of negligence, the inappropriateness of granting certiorari to re-examine the record is glaringly emphasized.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nAs this case presents a different situation from that involved in other negligence cases which, in increasing numbers I regret to say, have been passed on by this Court \n\n[353 \nU.S. 360, 362]\n\u00a0\n during the current Term,\n1\n I am constrained to write a few words in explanation of my dissent, beyond the views expressed in my dissenting opinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500, 559\n.\n\nThis case involves more than the problem of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict. Under Texas procedure, the trial court in this case required the jury to bring in a general verdict on the issue of whether the respondent had negligently failed to furnish petitioner with a safe place to work, and, if so, whether such failure was a contributing cause to the accident. The jury was also asked to make findings on special issues put to it by the court. The jury's general verdict was favorable to the petitioner, but its findings on the special issues were in favor of the respondent, and, as I see them, were wholly inconsistent with the general verdict.\n2\n In these \n\n[353 \nU.S. 360, 363]\n\u00a0\n circumstances the state appellate court, applying Texas law, held that the general verdict must yield to the inconsistent findings on the special issues, and that the trial court should have entered judgment for the respondent.\n\nI am unable to see any valid basis for this Court's action in upsetting this state judgment. Clearly, it seems to me, the Texas procedural rule which the Court of Civil Appeals applied in resolving the head-on collision in the jury's verdict did not subvert assertion of the federal rights established by the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Compare Brown v. Western R. Co., \n338 \nU.S. 294\n. Nor, in my opinion, can it be said that resolving these inconsistencies, in accordance with this local rule of practice, deprived the petitioner of any substantive right given him by the federal statute. Compare Dice v. Akron, C. & Y. R. Co., \n342 \nU.S. 359\n. Indeed, the procedural rule applied by the Texas court is identical with that which would have been applicable, in the same circumstances, had this case been tried in a federal court. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 49 (b).\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500\n; Webb v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 512\n; Herdman v.

He alleged that the respondent had negligently failed to provide him with a safe place to work by (1) not warning petitioner of the truck; (2) not protecting petitioner while he was working in the passageway; (3) allowing the truck to be driven into the passageway; and (4) failing to see that the truck was not driven negligently. As to the special issues the jury found: (1) there was no negligence in failing to warn the petitioner of the truck; (2) there was no negligence in allowing the truck to be driven onto the passageway while the petitioner was working there; (3) there was no negligent failure on the part of the respondent to keep a proper lookout; (4) there was no negligent failure on the part of the truck driver to keep a proper lookout; (5) there was no negligence in failing to give a warning \n\n[353 \nU.S. 360, 363]\n\u00a0\n before backing up the truck; (6) there was no negligence in backing the truck into the passageway; (7) the truck did not back too close to the tracks, did not back up too fast, and was not negligently driven without adequate visibility; (8) petitioner did not move into the path of the truck \"when such movement could not be made with safety\"; and (9) petitioner failed to keep a proper lookout for the truck, and this failure was a cause of the accident, though not the sole cause.\n\nI do not understand how it could be claimed that these findings were not inconsistent with the general verdict. Indeed, every specific allegation of negligence set forth in petitioner's complaint was rejected by the jury. And, as I see it, every factual basis on which a finding could be based that respondent had negligently failed to provide petitioner with a safe place to work was rejected by the jury. All that remains to show that the passageway was a dangerous spot is the fact that the accident occurred there - something which, until now, I have never supposed could be equated with negligence. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 360, 364]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAUTOMOBILE CLUB v. COMMISSIONER(1957)\nNo. 89\nArgued: Decided: April 22, 1957\n\n\n\n\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, by rulings in 1934 and 1938, exempted petitioner automobile club from income taxes as a \"club\" within the meaning of provisions corresponding to 101 (9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In 1945, the Commissioner revoked his 1934 and 1938 rulings, which were based upon a mistake of law, and directed petitioner to file returns for 1943 and subsequent years. The Commissioner also determined that prepaid membership dues received by petitioner should be treated as income in the year received. The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner's determinations, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 181-190.\n\n 1. The Commissioner had power to apply the revocation retroactively to 1943 and 1944. Pp. 183-185.\n\n\n (a) The doctrine of equitable estoppel does not bar correction by the Commissioner of a mistake of law. P. 183.\n\n\n 2. In the circumstances of this case, the Commissioner did not abuse the discretion vested in him by 3791 (b) of the 1939 Code. Pp. 184-186.\n\n\n  (a) It is clear from the language and legislative history of 3791 (b) that it confirmed the authority of the Commissioner to correct any ruling, regulation or Treasury decision retroactively, and empowered him, in his discretion, to limit retroactive application to the extent necessary to avoid inequitable results. P. 184.\n\n\n  (b) Helvering v. Reynolds Co., \n306 \nU.S. 110\n, distinguished. Pp. 184-185.\n\n\n  (c) Having dealt with petitioner upon the same basis as other automobile clubs, the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion. Pp. 185-186.\n\n\n  (d) The 2-year delay in proceeding with petitioner's case did not, in the circumstances, vitiate the Commissioner's action. P. 186.\n\n\n 3. In the circumstances of this case, assessment of tax deficiencies against petitioner for 1943 and 1944 was not barred by limitations under 275 (a) and 276 (b) of the 1939 Code. Pp. 186-187. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 181]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (a) The express condition prescribed by Congress was that the statute was to run against the United States from the date of the actual filing of the return, and no action of the Commissioner's can change or modify the conditions under which the United States consents to the running of the statute of limitations against it. P. 187.\n\n\n  (b) Form 990 returns are not tax returns within the contemplation of 275 (a) of the 1939 Code. Pp. 187-188.\n\n\n 4. The Commissioner's determination that the entire amount of prepaid dues received in each year by petitioner should be reported as income for that year (instead of being allocated over the following 12 months) did not exceed the permissible limits of the Commissioner's discretion under 41 of the 1939 Code. Pp. 188-190.\n\n\n 230 F.2d 585, affirmed.\n\nEllsworth C. Alvord and Raymond H. Berry argued the cause for petitioner. With them on the brief were A. H. Moorman and Lincoln Arnold.\n\nJohn N. Stull argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice, I. Henry Kutz and Joseph F. Goetten.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn 1945, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue revoked his 1934 and 1938 rulings exempting the petitioner from federal income taxes, and retroactively applied the revocation to 1943 and 1944. The Commissioner also determined that prepaid membership dues received by the petitioner should be taken into income in the year received, rejecting the petitioner's method of reporting as income only that part of the dues as was recorded on petitioner's books as earned in the tax year. The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner's determinations,\n1\n and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 182]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\n2\n This Court granted certiorari.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Commissioner had determined in 1934 that the petitioner was a \"club\" entitled to exemption under provisions of the internal revenue laws corresponding to 101 (9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939,\n4\n notifying the petitioner that \". . . future returns, under the provisions of section 101 (9) . . . will not be required so long as there is no change in your organization, your purposes or methods of doing business.\" In 1938, the Commissioner confirmed this ruling in a letter stating: \". . . as it appears that there has been no change in your form of organization or activities which would affect your status the previous ruling of the Bureau holding you to be exempt from filing returns of income is affirmed . . . .\" Accordingly the petitioner did not pay federal taxes from 1933 to 1945. The Commissioner revoked these rulings in 1945, however, and directed the petitioner to file returns for 1943 and subsequent years.\n5\n Pursuant to this \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 183]\n\u00a0\n direction, the petitioner filed, under protest, corporate income and excess profits tax returns for 1943, 1944 and 1945.\n\nThe Commissioner's earlier rulings were grounded upon an erroneous interpretation of the term \"club\" in 101 (9) and thus were based upon a mistake of law. It is conceded that in 1943 and 1944 petitioner was not, in fact or in law, a \"club\" entitled to exemption within the meaning of 101 (9), and also that petitioner is subject to taxation for 1945 and subsequent years.\n6\n It is nevertheless contended that the Commissioner had no power to apply the revocation retroactively to 1943 and 1944, and that, in any event, the assessment of taxes against petitioner for 1943 and 1944 was barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nThe petitioner argues that, in light of the 1934 and 1938 rulings, the Commissioner was equitably estopped from applying the revocation retroactively. This argument is without merit. The doctrine of equitable estoppel is not a bar to the correction by the Commissioner of a mistake of law.\n7\n The decision in Stockstrom v. Commissioner, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 184]\n\u00a0\n 88 U.S. App. D.C. 286, 190 F.2d 283, to the extent that it holds to the contrary, is disapproved.\n\nPetitioner's reliance on H. S. D. Co. v. Kavanagh, 191 F.2d 831, and Woodworth v. Kales, 26 F.2d 178, is misplaced because those cases did not involve correction of an erroneous ruling of law. Reliance on Lesavoy Foundation v. Commissioner, 238 F.2d 589, is also misplaced because there the court recognized the power in the Commissioner to correct a mistake of law, but held that in the circumstances of the case the Commissioner had exceeded the bounds of the discretion vested in him under 3791 (b) of the 1939 Code.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe Commissioner's action may not be disturbed unless, in the circumstances of this case, the Commissioner abused the discretion vested in him by 3791 (b) of the 1939 Code. That section provides:\n\n \"RETROACTIVITY OF REGULATIONS OR RULINGS. -  The Secretary, or the Commissioner with the approval  of the Secretary, may prescribe the extent, if  any, to which any ruling, regulation, or Treasury  Decision, relating to the internal revenue laws, shall  be applied without retroactive effect.\"\n\n\n The petitioner contends that this section forbids the Commissioner taking retroactive action. On the contrary, it is clear from the language of the section and its legislative history\n9\n that Congress thereby confirmed the authority of the Commissioner to correct any ruling, regulation or Treasury decision retroactively, but empowered him, in his discretion, to limit retroactive application to the extent necessary to avoid inequitable results.\n\nThe petitioner, citing Helvering v. Reynolds Co., \n306 \nU.S. 110\n, argues that resort by the Commissioner to \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 185]\n\u00a0\n 3791 (b) was precluded in this case because the repeated re-enactments of 101 (9) gave the force of law to the provision of the Treasury regulations relating to that section. These regulations provided that when an organization had established its right to exemption it need not thereafter make a return of income or any further showing with respect to its status unless it changed the character of its operations or the purpose for which it was originally created.\n10\n Helvering v. Reynolds Co. is inapplicable to this case. As stated by the Tax Court: \"The regulations involved there [Helvering v. Reynolds Co.] . . . purported to determine what did or did not constitute gain or loss. The regulations here . . . in nowise purported to determine whether any organization was or was not exempt.\"\n11\n These regulations did not provide the exemption or interpret 101 (9), but merely specified the necessary information required to be filed in order that the Commissioner might rule whether or not the taxpayer was entitled to exemption. This is thus not a case of \". . . administrative construction embodied in the regulation[s] . . .\" which, by repeated re-enactment of 101 (9), \". . . Congress must be taken to have approved . . . and thereby to have given . . . the force of law.\" Helvering v. Reynolds Co., \n306 \nU.S., at 114\n, 115.\n\nWe must, then, determine whether the retroactive action of the Commissioner was an abuse of discretion in the circumstances of this case. The action was the consequence of the reconsideration by the Commissioner, in 1943, of the correctness of the prior rulings exempting automobile clubs, initiated by a General Counsel Memorandum interpreting 101 (9) to be inapplicable to such organizations.\n12\n The Commissioner adopted the General \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 186]\n\u00a0\n Counsel's interpretation and proceeded to apply it, effective from 1943, indiscriminately to automobile clubs.\n13\n We thus find no basis for disagreeing with the conclusion, reached by both the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals, that the Commissioner, having dealt with petitioner upon the same basis as other automobile clubs, did not abuse his discretion. Nor did the two-year delay in proceeding with the petitioner's case, in these circumstances, vitiate the Commissioner's action.\n\nThe petitioner's contention that the statute of limitations barred the assessment of deficiencies for 1943 and 1944 is also without merit. Its returns for those years were not filed until October 22, 1945. Within three years, on August 25, 1948, the petitioner and the Commissioner signed consents extending the period to June 30, 1949. The period was later extended to June 20, 1950. Notice of deficiencies was mailed to petitioner on February 20, 1950. The assessments were therefore within time under 275 (a) and 276 (b)\n14\n unless, as the petitioner \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 187]\n\u00a0\n asserts, the statute of limitations began to run from the dates when, if there was a duty to file, the statute required filing.\n15\n The petitioner argues that because its omission to file on March 15, 1944, and March 15, 1945, was induced by the Commissioner's 1934 and 1938 rulings, it is only equitable to interpret the statute of limitations as running from those dates in the circumstances of this case. But the express condition prescribed by the Congress was that the statute was to run against the United States from the date of the actual filing of the return, and no action of the Commissioner can change or modify the conditions under which the United States consents to the running of the statute of limitations against it. In Lucas v. Pilliod Lumber Co., \n281 \nU.S. 245, 249\n, this Court held:\n\n \"Under the established general rule a statute of limitation runs against the United States only when they assent and upon the conditions prescribed. Here assent that the statute might begin to run was conditioned upon the presentation of a return duly sworn to. No officer had power to substitute something else for the thing specified. . . .\"\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\n It is also argued that the Form 990 returns filed by the petitioner in compliance with 54 (f) of the 1939 Code, as amended,\n17\n constituted the filing of returns for the purposes \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 188]\n\u00a0\n of 275 (a). But the Form 990 returns are merely information returns in furtherance of a congressional program to secure information useful in a determination whether legislation should be enacted to subject to taxation certain tax-exempt corporations competing with taxable corporations.\n18\n Those returns lack the data necessary for the computation and assessment of deficiencies and are not therefore tax returns within the contemplation of 275 (a). Cf. Commissioner v. Lane-Wells Co., \n321 \nU.S. 219\n.\n\nThe final issue argued concerns the treatment of membership dues and arises because such dues are paid in advance for one year. The dues upon collection are deposited in a general bank account and are not segregated from general funds but are available and are used for general corporate purposes. For bookkeeping purposes, however, the dues upon receipt are credited to an account carried as a liability account and designated \"Unearned Membership Dues.\" During the first month of membership and each of the following eleven months one-twelfth of the amount paid is credited to an account designated \"Membership Income.\" This method of accounting was followed by petitioner from 1934. The income from such dues reported by petitioner in each of its tax returns for 1943 through 1947 was the amount credited in the year to the \"Membership Income\" account. The Commissioner determined that the petitioner received the prepaid dues under a claim of right, without restriction as to their disposition, and therefore the entire amount received in each year should be reported as income. The Commissioner relies upon North American Oil v. Burnet, \n286 \nU.S. 417, 424\n, where this Court said: \"If a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 189]\n\u00a0\n and without restriction as to its disposition, . . . [it] has received income which . . . [it] is required to return . . . .\"\n\nThe petitioner does not deny that it has the unrestricted use of the dues income in the year of receipt, but contends that its accrual method of accounting clearly reflects its income, and that the Commissioner is therefore bound to accept its method of reporting membership dues. We do not agree. Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 required that \"[t]he net income shall be computed . . . in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books . . . but . . . if the method employed does not clearly reflect the income, the computation shall be made in accordance with such method as in the opinion of the Commissioner does clearly reflect the income. . . .\"\n19\n The pro rata allocation of the membership dues in monthly amounts is purely artificial and bears no relation to the services which petitioner may in fact be called upon to render for the member.\n20\n Section 41 vests the Commissioner with discretion to determine whether the petitioner's method of accounting clearly reflects income. We cannot say, in the circumstances here, that the discretionary \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 190]\n\u00a0\n action of the Commissioner, sustained by both the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals, exceeded permissible limits. See Brown v. Helvering, \n291 \nU.S. 193, 204\n-205.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 20 T.

In Beacon, performance of the subscription, in most instances, was, in part, necessarily deferred until the publication dates after the tax year. In Schuessler, performance of the service agreement required the taxpayer to furnish services at specified times in years subsequent to the tax year. In this case, substantially all services are performed only upon a member's demand and the taxpayer's performance was not related to fixed dates after the tax year. We express no opinion upon the correctness of the decisions in Beacon or Schuessler.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nI join in the Court's opinion insofar as it holds (a) that the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion under 3791 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 when, in 1946, he revoked previous rulings exempting petitioner from federal income taxes and directed petitioner to file returns for 1943 and 1944, and (b) that assessment of deficiencies for those years was not barred by the statute of limitations. However, for the reasons stated by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, I dissent from the Court's holding that the Commissioner acted within his discretion under 41 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 when he determined, in reliance upon the \"claim of right\" doctrine, that petitioner's method of accounting for prepaid membership dues did not clearly reflect its income.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nI think collection of the 1943 and 1944 taxes, based on the Commissioner's retroactive revocation of his 1934 and 1938 exemption rulings, was barred by the three-year statute of limitations.\n1\n I would hold that the limitations period began to run when the taxpayer, relying on the exemption ruling, duly filed its Form 990 returns\n2\n for the years 1943 and 1944. I see no reason why we should \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 191]\n\u00a0\n strain to construe \"return\" in 275 (a) as excluding an information return when such a return was the only one required of this taxpayer, exempt from taxation at the time, and especially when that construction produces the inequitable consequences which have resulted here. Section 275 (a) should be construed in conjunction with 276 (a),\n3\n which provides that an assessment may be made without regard to the statute of limitations in \"the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax or of a failure to file a return . . . .\" In my judgment, a taxpayer who files a return on one form rather than another because the Commissioner directs him to do so cannot be charged with the \"failure\" contemplated by the statute. See Stockstrom v. Commissioner, 88 U.S. App. D.C. 286, 190 F.2d 283; Balkan Nat. Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 101 F.2d 75. Commissioner v. Lane-Wells Co., \n321 \nU.S. 219\n, cited by the Court, is inapposite because the taxpayer there was required by applicable statutes and regulations to file two returns and had filed only one. Compare Germantown Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n309 \nU.S. 304\n. Under the decision of the Court, the Commissioner may revoke his rulings retroactively so long as his action does not constitute an \"abuse of discretion.\" I see no reason why that power should not also be subjected to the three-year limit established by Congress.\n\nI also disagree with the Court's holding that the Commissioner may properly tax in the year of receipt the full amount of petitioner's prepaid membership dues. The Commissioner seeks to justify that course under the \"claim of right\" doctrine announced in North American Oil v. Burnet, \n286 \nU.S. 417\n. However, that doctrine, it seems to me, comes into play only in determining whether the treatment of an item of income should be influenced by the fact that the right to receive or keep it \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 192]\n\u00a0\n is in dispute; it does not relate to the entirely different question whether items that admittedly belong to the taxpayer may be attributed to a taxable year other than that of receipt in accordance with principles of accrual accounting. See Brown v. Helvering, \n291 \nU.S. 193\n, where these two problems were involved and were treated as distinct. The collection of taxes clearly should not be made to depend on the vicissitudes of litigation with third parties in which the taxpayer may be engaged. That is quite a different thing, however, from holding that the Commissioner may force taxpayers to abandon reasonable and accurate methods of accounting simply because they do not reflect advance receipts as income in the year received. Under 41 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939,\n4\n the income of the taxpayer is to be determined \"in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the [taxpayer's] books,\" unless \"the method employed does not clearly reflect\" the taxpayer's income. Under 42,\n5\n items of gross income need not be reported in the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer if, \"under methods of accounting permitted under section 41, any such amounts are to be properly accounted for as of a different period.\" And it is clear that accrual methods of accounting may be employed. United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422\n. The Commissioner's own regulations authorize the deferral of income in some instances.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court, however, now by-passes the Commissioner's \"claim of right\" argument, and rests its decision instead on the ground that the \"pro rata allocation of the membership \n\n[353 \nU.S. 180, 193]\n\u00a0\n dues in monthly amounts is purely artificial and bears no relation to the services which petitioner may in fact be called upon to render for the member,\" so that it cannot say that in doing what he did the Commissioner exceeded the limits of his discretion. I do not understand this, because the Commissioner does not deny - as, indeed, he could not - that the method of accounting used by the taxpayer reflects its net earnings with considerably greater accuracy than the method he proposes. Nor does he urge that the taxpayer's accounting system defers income in a manner or to an extent that would make the Government unreasonably dependent on the continued solvency of the taxpayer's business.

JACKSON(1957)\nNo. 370\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In this suit under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, a section foreman of a railroad was awarded damages for injuries sustained while operating a gasoline-powered motor track car pulling a hand car hauling material, tools and equipment. Each car had only four wheels. The cars were fastened together by a pin, not a coupler. The motor track car had only hand brakes and the hand car had no brakes. There was evidence that the accident resulted from want of adequate brakes for the use to which the cars were being put. The sole issue before this Court was whether such vehicles, when used in the manner here involved, are within the coverage of the Safety Appliance Acts. Held:\n\n 1. The motor track car and hand car, when used in the manner employed here, must be equipped in accordance with the requirements of the Safety Appliance Acts. Pp. 328-333.\n\n\n  (a) When a railroad puts a motor track car to locomotive use in pulling a hand car used to haul material, tools and equipment, the commands of the Acts must be obeyed. Pp. 329-330.\n\n\n  (b) That, for 60 years, the Interstate Commerce Commission had not required such cars to be equipped in accordance with the Acts is not a binding administrative interpretation that Congress did not intend these cars to come within the purview of the Acts when used in the manner here involved. Pp. 330-331.\n\n\n  (c) Whether the Safety Appliance Acts should apply to such cars is a matter of policy for Congress to decide, and it made the Acts applicable all-inclusively to \"all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles.\" Pp. 331-333.\n\n\n 2. Though they had only four wheels each, these cars were not exempted from the Acts by 6, which exempts certain \"trains composed of four-wheel cars.\" P. 333.\n\n\n 98 U.S. App. D.C. 169, 233 F.2d 660, affirmed.\n\nStephen Ailes argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nMilford J. Meyer argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Irving L. Chasen. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 326]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRobert W. Ginnane and Charlie H. Johns filed a brief for the Interstate Commerce Commission, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a suit for damages arising from an injury suffered by a section foreman of the petitioner while operating a motor track car that was towing a push truck on petitioner's tracks. It was brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The sole question is whether such vehicles when used in the manner here are within the coverage of the Safety Appliance Acts.\n1\n The petitioner contends that neither vehicle comes within the general coverage of the Acts; and, in the alternative if the vehicles are included, that they are exempted as \"four-wheel cars\" under 6 of the Acts.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nBoth the trial court and the Court of Appeals have decided that the vehicles involved here are included within the coverage of the Safety Appliance Acts and that neither falls within any exemption contained therein. The case reaches us on certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 889\n. We agree with the two-court interpretation of the Acts as applied to the facts here involved. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 327]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe respondent was injured over five years ago. For 39 years he had been a section foreman of track maintenance for petitioner. He and the crew over which he had supervision were responsible for the maintenance and repair of a section of track between Waring and Durwood, Maryland. They used in their work a gasoline-motor-powered track car equipped with belt drive and a hand brake. The car could carry as many as 12 men and their tools. At various times a push truck or hand car was coupled by a pin to the motor track car and was towed by it to the scene of the work. The hand car weighed about 800 pounds unloaded, had a 5-ton carrying capacity, and had no brakes. Sometimes it carried a load of material and other times only equipment and tools. Each of these cars was equipped with four wheels and was capable of being removed from the rails by a crew of men.\n\nOn the occasion in question respondent and a crew of two men, pursuant to orders, had hauled about a ton of coal via the motor track car and hand car from Gaithersburg to the stationmaster at Washington Grove, a station near the scene of their roadbed work on that day. The coal was placed on the hand car which was pulled along the tracks by the motor car. The two vehicles also carried tools, a wheelbarrow, and other equipment, as well as the respondent and his crew. After unloading the coal they proceeded a short distance beyond the Washington Grove station to work on a section of the westbound track. There they removed the vehicles from the track and worked that section of the rails until about 4 p. m. They then replaced the vehicles on the tracks, fastened them together, and began the return trip to the yards at Gaithersburg. On approaching the Washington Grove station at a speed of from 5 to 10 miles per hour the vehicles struck a large dog and derailed, throwing the respondent into a ditch and causing his injuries. The \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 328]\n\u00a0\n uncontradicted evidence was that respondent applied the hand brake on the motor track car immediately upon seeing the dog and the cars skidded on wet tracks about 39 feet before the impact. Respondent further testified that the motor track car alone, without the hand car attached, could have been stopped under the same conditions within six to eight feet.\n\nRespondent brought his action against the railroad claiming that (1) the petitioner was negligent in directing him to operate a motor track car and push truck without sufficient braking power, and in requiring him to pull the push truck over wet, slippery rails when the truck was not equipped with brakes, and (2) the injury was proximately caused by petitioner's noncompliance with the requirements of the Safety Appliance and Boiler Inspection Acts. The District Court ruled and instructed the jury that the provisions of the Safety Appliance Acts included within their coverage the vehicles in question. The issues in both causes of action were submitted to the jury, which returned with a verdict for respondent on \"the issues aforesaid.\" The appeal in the Court of Appeals was directed only to the second cause of action concerning the applicability of the Safety Appliance Acts. That court affirmed, 98 U.S. App. D.C. 169, 233 F.2d 660, and as has already been indicated, we are faced here only with the problem of the coverage of the Safety Appliance Acts.\n\nThe power or train brake provisions of the Safety Appliance Acts apply to the motor track car and the coupling and brake requirements to the hand car when they are employed in the manner here involved. If used separately, though we do not pass on the question, it may well be that entirely different sections of the Acts might apply to each of the vehicles. But here the hand car was not operated by hand as was originally intended. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 329]\n\u00a0\n On the contrary, it was fastened by a pin - not a coupler - to a motor track car, a self-propelled piece of equipment, and was hauled with its cargo to its destination on the tracks of petitioner. The hand car had no brakes, although the Acts specifically require \"any car\" to be equipped with a hand brake.\n3\n It was being used for hauling purposes. Furthermore, the motor track car, instead of being used solely to carry men and tools to their place of work, was used to pull or tow another car - albeit a hand car. It had no power or train brakes but was equipped with a simple hand brake designed for its individual operation. The brake was wholly insufficient for the use to which the railroad put the vehicles.\n\nWe believe that the controlling factor is the nature of the employment of the vehicles in the railroad's service, that is the type of operation for which they are being used. Here at the time of the injury it is admitted that petitioner was putting the motor track car to locomotive uses in pulling a hand car used to haul material, tools, and equipment. In the light of the prime purpose of the Safety Appliance Acts, i. e., \"the protection of employees and others by requiring the use of safe equipment,\" Lilly v. Grand Trunk R. Co., \n317 \nU.S. 481, 486\n (1943), when the railroad uses this type of equipment in this manner - regardless of the label it places on the vehicles - the commands of the Acts must be obeyed. The operation as conducted when the respondent was injured, with a motor track car equipped with neither power nor train brakes pulling an attached hand car with neither an automatic \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 330]\n\u00a0\n coupler nor hand brake, was in defiance of the requirements of the Acts. See 45 U.S.C. 1-8. This is not to say that these vehicles, even when used as herein described, must be equipped with devices not adaptable to their safe operation. As was said in Southern R. Co. v. Crockett, \n234 \nU.S. 725\n (1914):\n\n \"We deem the true intent and meaning to be that  the provisions and requirements respecting train  brakes, automatic couplers, grab irons, and the height  of draw-bars shall be extended to all railroad  vehicles . . . so far as the respective safety devices  and standards are capable of being installed upon  the respective vehicles.\" Id., at 737-738.\n\n\n It is said that there is no place on the vehicles in question here for a grab iron or a handhold and that power brakes might well increase the hazards of their operation. This may be true, but if these vehicles are to be used in a manner such as here, the Commission through the promulgation of standards or regulations covering such equipment should adapt the safety requirements of the Acts to the safe use of such vehicles and thus protect employees and the public from the hazards of their operation.\n\nIt is contended that, since the Commission has for over 60 years considered maintenance-of-way vehicles not subject to the Acts, this consistent administrative interpretation is persuasive evidence that the Congress never intended to include them within its coverage. It is true that long administrative practice is entitled to weight, Davis v. Manry, \n266 \nU.S. 401, 405\n (1925), but here there has been no expressed administrative determination of the problem.\n4\n We believe petitioner overspeaks \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 331]\n\u00a0\n in elevating negative action to positive administrative decision. In our view the failure of the Commission to act is not a binding administrative interpretation that Congress did not intend these cars to come within the purview of the Acts. See Shields v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n350 \nU.S. 318, 321\n-322 (1956).\n\nThe fact that the Commission has not sponsored legislation rather indicates that it thought the problem too insignificant for consideration. We think the Commission expresses this view in its amicus curiae brief when it says \"the needs are for strict enforcement of sound operating rules and regulations rather than for air brakes, automatic couplers and the other devices specified in the Safety Appliance Acts.\" But this is a matter of policy for the Congress to decide and it wrote into the Safety Appliance Acts that their coverage embraced \"all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles.\"\n5\n This plain language could not have been more all-inclusive. This Court has construed the language of the Act in its generic sense. In Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., \n196 \nU.S. 1\n (1904), with reference to the meaning of the word \"car,\" the Court said: \"There is nothing to indicate that any particular kind of car was meant. Tested by context, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 332]\n\u00a0\n subject matter and object, `any car' meant all kinds of cars running on the rails, including locomotives.\" Id., at 15-16. See also Spokane & Inland R. Co. v. Campbell, \n241 \nU.S. 497\n (1916).\n\nWhile there is a paucity of cases on the point, with none to the contrary of our holding here, as early as 1934 in Hoffman v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 74 F.2d 227, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held a hand car or push truck, identical with the one here involved, and a small gasoline tractor subject to the Acts. The hand car was attached to the gasoline tractor by means of a hook (though the engine had an automatic coupler on one end) and the petitioner was injured when the hook dislodged and he was pinned between the car and the locomotive. The court unanimously held that if a hand car \"is to be operated by a locomotive [which it held the gasoline tractor to be], rather than by hand, we are not inclined to depart from the literal terms of the statute and dispense with the requirement of an automatic coupler.\" Id., at 232. Three years later the requirement of the Acts as to power or train brakes was held applicable to other than standard equipment in United States v. Ft. Worth & D.C. R. Co., 21 F. Supp. 916. There a trial court in the Northern District of Texas held that where a locomotive crane was \"used to haul cars . . . it is being used for the purposes for which a locomotive is used and is a locomotive . . . regardless of whatever else it might also be.\" Id., at 918. In 1955 the Supreme Court of Florida unanimously held in Martin v. Johnston, 79 So.2d 419, that the same type motor track car as is involved here came within the terms of the Acts. There the motor track car was being used entirely separately and independently from any other vehicle. The Safety Acts require all cars to be equipped with \"efficient hand brakes.\" The failure of the brakes was the cause of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 333]\n\u00a0\n the injury. The court commented: \"There being as much reason for requiring the motor-car in question to be equipped with efficient handbrakes, to insure its safe operation when propelled under its own power, as there is for the requirement that such a car be equipped with automatic couplers, where it is to be used in connection with a train movement, we have the view that the Safety Appliance Acts are applicable and that we are not authorized to depart from the literal terms of the statute.\" Id., at 420.\n\nNor do we find that 6 of the Acts exempts these vehicles from the provisions of the Acts. Though it is true that the cars are of the four-wheel variety, they are used neither in coal trains nor as logging cars. As the Commission points out in its amicus curiae brief, the proviso of 6 originally exempted \"trains composed of four-wheel cars or . . . locomotives used in hauling such trains,\" and the legislative history shows that this provision was enacted specifically to exempt coal cars. 24 Cong. Rec. 1477. This language was incorporated in the phraseology of the present section which admittedly through error was thought to apply to the exemption of trains composed of logging cars. See H. R. Rep. No. 727, 54th Cong., 1st Sess. The legislative history of the section reveals beyond doubt that it has no application here.\n\nIn view of the history and purposes of the Safety Appliance Acts, and the literal language used by the Congress that they embraced \"any car\"\n6\n and \"any locomotive engine . . . hauling . . . any car,\"\n7\n together with the practical necessity of affording safety appliances to thousands of railroad maintenance employees, as well as the public, we conclude that the motor track car and hand car \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 334]\n\u00a0\n when used by the petitioner in the manner employed here must be equipped in accordance with the requirements of the Safety Appliance Acts.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 27 Stat. 531, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 1-16.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 27 Stat. 532, as amended, 29 Stat. 85, 62 Stat. 909, 45 U.S.C. 6, provides in part:\n\n\"That any such common carrier using any locomotive engine, running any train, or hauling or permitting to be hauled or used on its line any car in violation of any of the provisions of this Act, shall be liable to a penalty . . .: Provided, That nothing in this Act contained shall apply to trains composed of four-wheel cars or to trains composed of eight-wheel standard logging cars where the height of such car from top of rail to center of coupling does not exceed twenty-five inches, or to locomotives used in hauling such trains when such cars or locomotives are exclusively used for the transportation of logs.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 36 Stat. 298, 45 U.S.C. 11, provides in part:\n\n\". . . it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this Act to haul, or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car subject to the provisions of this Act not equipped with appliances provided for in this Act, to wit: All cars must be equipped with secure sill steps and efficient hand brakes . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] We note that in 1953 the Interstate Commerce Commission, in a proceeding to prescribe rules governing inspection of electrically operated units and multiple-unit equipment, has itself declared a \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 331]\n\u00a0\n \"self-propelled unit of equipment capable of moving other equipment\" to be a locomotive under the Act. Ex parte No. 179, 297 I. C. C. 177, 192. While the proceeding did not involve motor track cars, the language of the Commission casts some light on that problem. The Commission pointed out that \"The language in the act is all-inclusive, and considering its purpose . . . the words `any locomotive' as used in section 2 must be construed as intended to encompass all of the motive equipment of any carrier subject to the act. . . . Appearance clearly cannot determine the classification into which this type of equipment should be placed.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., at 191-192.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 32 Stat. 943, 45 U.S.C. 8.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C. 2.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 27 Stat. 532, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 6.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nIn this Federal Employers' Liability Act suit, the District Court instructed the jury that the Safety Appliance Acts\n1\n required the railroad to equip a gasoline-driven motor track car with a train brake and a push truck with a hand brake, and that the railroad was liable if its failure to furnish this equipment contributed to the accident. The correctness of this instruction presents the issue whether the Safety Appliance Acts apply to these small maintenance-of-way vehicles - the successors to the familiar handcars of years ago. The Court approves the instruction, and, in doing so, it holds that a motor car is a \"locomotive,\" that a push truck is a \"car,\" and that the two combined are a \"train\" as those terms are used in the Safety Appliance Acts. I do not find in the language of the Acts, their background and legislative history, or in the long-standing administrative practice of the Interstate Commerce Commission justification for so holding.\n\nOn November 1, 1951, respondent Jackson, the foreman of a Baltimore & Ohio maintenance crew, was engaged with two of his men in railroad maintenance work near Washington Grove, Maryland. At quitting time, the three men lifted a motorized track car and a push truck onto the tracks, coupled them together by hand, and boarded the motor car for their return to the section house about one mile away. It had been raining lightly \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 335]\n\u00a0\n and the tracks were wet. The motor car and push truck had traveled about 195 feet when Jackson, who was operating the motor car, saw a large dog about to cross the tracks in front of the car. He threw out the clutch and applied the hand brake with both hands. The brakes grabbed, the wheels locked and the vehicles slid \"about 20 feet\" on the wet tracks before striking the dog and overturning. Jackson was injured.\n\nThe motor track car on which Jackson and his crew were riding was a four-wheel maintenance-of-way vehicle weighing about 800 pounds. Powered by a gasoline motor and controlled with a throttle, clutch and hand brake, it was typical of the more than 60,000 vehicles of this type currently in use on American railroads to carry maintenance crews from section houses to places along the railroad where work is to be performed. The push truck was an even simpler vehicle. It consisted of four wheels, a chassis, and a flat wooden platform, and could be pushed along the tracks by hand.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the push truck was attached to the rear of the motor car by a simple nonautomatic link and pin device, and carried no load except a few tools. Jackson testified that the use of a push truck in conjunction with a motor track car was customary; that neither vehicle carried an unusual or excessive load; that each was provided with the usual equipment of such vehicles; and that the hand brake of the motor car was in proper working order at the time of the accident.\n\nThe Safety Appliance Acts make it mandatory that specified equipment be used on railroad vehicles covered by the Acts. Criminal penalties are imposed for each violation.\n2\n Civil liability in damages under the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 336]\n\u00a0\n Federal Employers' Liability Act follows as a matter of course if the violation is a proximate cause of an employee's injury.\n3\n The vehicles subject to the Acts must be equipped with such devices as power driving-wheel brakes, appliances for operating a train-brake system, automatic couplers of a standard height, sill steps, grab irons and handholds, and hand brakes. In determining whether motor cars and push trucks must be equipped with such appliances, the language of the Acts is the proper starting point.\n\nThe Safety Appliance Acts apply expressly to \"all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce . . . and to all other locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used in connection therewith . . . .\" 32 Stat. 943, 45 U.S.C. 8. The term \"similar vehicles\" shows that all vehicles are not included. Motor cars and push trucks must come within the terms \"locomotives,\" \"cars,\" or \"similar vehicles.\"\n\nThe statutory context demonstrates that the crucial terms - \"locomotives\" and \"cars\" - were used in their ordinary sense as referring to standard operating equipment rather than to small maintenance-of-way vehicles like those involved in this case. For example, 1, 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C. 1, which requires \"power driving-wheel brake[s]\" and a \"train-brake system,\" speaks in terms of a \"locomotive engine,\" \"engineer,\" \"brakemen\" and \"train.\"\n4\n A small motor car used to haul section \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 337]\n\u00a0\n hands and their tools to and from work would not ordinarily be called a \"locomotive engine\" except in jest, nor would a motor car with a push truck attached be referred to as a \"train.\" Much less would the section hand operating the motor car, who would ordinarily belong to a separate union - the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees - be referred to as an \"engineer\" or his crew as \"brakemen.\" This is language appropriate to vehicles and employees used in standard freight and passenger operations but not to a motor car towing a push truck.\n\nOther sections indicate that the word \"car\" refers to standard railroad cars. Section 2 makes it unlawful for any railroad \"to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car . . . not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.\" 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C. 2. This section, as well as the detailed provisions of 5 dealing with the prescribed height of drawbars on couplers, could not be applicable to cars of little more than a yard's height easily coupled by hand without danger to anyone.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe background and legislative history of the three Safety Appliance Acts confirm this view. Their history reveals not only that it never was suggested that the Acts were applicable to small maintenance-of-way vehicles, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 338]\n\u00a0\n but also that the stated objectives of the Acts would not be served by subjecting these vehicles to the Acts.\n\nThe recognized purpose of each of the Safety Appliance Acts was the protection of operating employees of railroads from the hazards involved in the movement of standard trains and cars. The first Safety Appliance Act, 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C. 1-7, enacted in 1893, was preceded by a decade of concern, not with light maintenance equipment, but with the death toll caused by the two major hazards facing railroad trainmen: (1) the necessity for operating employees to work between freight cars in coupling them, and (2) the necessity for brakemen to operate hand brakes while standing on the tops of freight cars.\n6\n The Interstate Commerce Commission, the railroad Brotherhoods, and other groups advocated legislation which would reduce these hazards by requiring uniform automatic couplers and power brakes on freight trains.\n7\n Congress was concerned wholly with these hazards and the Act adopted relates entirely to them.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 339]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe present significance of these specific objectives is that they do not relate to motor cars and push trucks. Unlike standard railroad cars and trains, motor cars and push trucks do not require power brakes to bring them safely to a stop, and they do not endanger the section hands who couple them by pushing them together by hand. Operated and used by maintenance workers rather than by operating employees, motor cars and push trucks move at comparatively slow speeds and present hazards quite different from those faced by trainmen on standard trains.\n\nBy 1900, the railroads were in substantial compliance with the original Act.\n9\n Nevertheless, the Interstate Commerce Commission, disturbed because some locomotives and standard cars were not required to be equipped with automatic couplers, recommended broadening amendments. These recommendations called for automatic couplers for all locomotives and for \"all vehicles . . . which are ordinarily hauled or propelled by standard locomotives.\"\n10\n The second Safety Appliance Act, enacted in 1903, 32 Stat. 943, 45 U.S.C. 8-10, incorporated these recommendations. It extended the first Act to \"all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce . . . and to all other locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used in connection therewith . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) Initially, the word \"vehicles\" in the bill was unqualified by the word \"similar.\" S. Rep. No. 1930, 57th \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 340]\n\u00a0\n Cong., 1st Sess. 16. However, a railroad representative objected to it on the ground that it was too broad and suggested the term \"traffic cars.\" Id., at 16-17. The legislative representative of the Brotherhoods opposed the suggested substitute because it might be thought inapplicable to \"cabooses, steam shovels, snowplows, scale cars, and similar conveyances,\" which are used in connection with standard equipment. Id., at 46. The result was that the word \"vehicles\" was qualified by the addition of \"similar.\" This indicates that the term \"similar vehicles\" was used to cover special equipment, such as snowplows, used in connection with standard equipment. Maintenance-of-way vehicles have never been capable of such use.\n\nThe third Safety Appliance Act, 36 Stat. 298, 45 U.S.C. 11-16, enacted in 1910, supplemented the existing Acts so as to require additional safety appliances, but did not extend the coverage. \"Cars\" were to be equipped with secure sill steps and efficient hand brakes; \"cars\" requiring secure ladders and running boards were to be so equipped; secure handholds or grab irons were to be installed on the roofs at the tops of such ladders; and the Commission was to designate the standards for these and certain other appliances, as well as to modify or change the standard height for drawbars. These additions grew out of recommendations made by the Commission and their history reveals an intent to secure uniform equipment on operating cars.\n11\n Uniformity was considered to be imperative because trainmen working on trains by day and by night would operate more safely if the appliances they needed - sill steps, ladders, running boards, grab irons and the like - were uniform in character and location on all freight cars. Most \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 341]\n\u00a0\n of these appliances are not at all adapted to motor cars and push trucks. On these small vehicles there not only is little or no need for this equipment, but there is no suitable place to attach it.\n\nThe inapplicability of the Safety Appliance Acts to maintenance-of-way vehicles is confirmed by the long-standing administrative interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Commission and by numerous practical considerations. The Interstate Commerce Commission has administered these Acts for over half a century. During that time, it has, by its own statement, \"never considered the small maintenance of way vehicles subject to those acts . . . .\"\n12\n Its order of March 13, 1911, specifying the number, dimensions and location of the appliances required by the Acts, omits all mention of motor track cars and push trucks.\n13\n Motor cars are not subjected to the inspection required of \"locomotives.\" Maintenance-of-way vehicles are not considered as trains, locomotives or cars for accident reporting purposes.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nDespite the Commission's consistent construction of the Acts since their inceptions, the Court today states \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 342]\n\u00a0\n that \"there has been no expressed administrative determination . . . .\" Ante, p. 330. Not only was there no reason for the Commission to disclaim application, but its \"negative\" action in declining to subject these vehicles to the Acts is impressive because the Acts impose an affirmative duty on the Commission to enforce their provisions.\n15\n The Commission and the Department of Justice have been aware that motor cars and push trucks used by American railroads were not equipped with automatic couplers, power brakes and so on. Their failure to prosecute evidences their interpretation of the Acts. Federal Trade Commission v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., \n312 \nU.S. 349, 351\n-352.\n\nThe contemporaneous and long-standing interpretation of any regulatory Act by the agency that administers it is entitled to great weight.\n16\n Here there are considerations entitling the Interstate Commerce Commission's views to special respect. See Davis v. Manry, \n266 \nU.S. 401, 404\n-405. The Commission has played a predominant role in developing and perfecting the Acts, and Congress has given it broad discretionary powers in administering them. Its consistent interpretation of the Acts, known to Congress, the railroad industry and the railroad labor organizations, is persuasive evidence that the Acts never were intended to apply to motor cars and push trucks.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 343]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is also significant that the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, whose members operate and maintain motor cars in their work, never has contended that the Safety Appliance Acts apply to these vehicles. However, the Brotherhood has been active in soliciting other legislation which it feels will add to the safety of its members.\n18\n It has sought legislation from Congress which would require strict enforcement of sound operating rules and regulations. Although supported by the Commission, these attempts thus far have failed.\n19\n The Brotherhood, however, has secured other safety legislation. Largely at its request, 26 States, in recent years, have adopted legislation requiring specific equipment, such as headlights, taillights, windshields, windshield wipers and canopies, on motor track cars.\n20\n This state legislation dealing expressly with the safety requirements of motor \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 344]\n\u00a0\n track cars indicates that the Federal Acts have not been thought to apply to them. As to the question of preemption, see Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 605, 611\n.\n\nPractical considerations, relating to the safety of railroad maintenance workers who use motor cars and push trucks, support the inapplicability of the Acts. The major hazard in the use of these vehicles is the risk of their collision with trains. It is important that maintenance-of-way vehicles be so light that three or four men can lift them quickly off the tracks. In contrast, most of the safety appliances required by the Acts have little or no relation to this or other safety requirements of these small vehicles. Whether it is feasible to equip them with power brakes, automatic couplers, and the other appliances specified in the Acts is highly conjectural. Motor cars and push trucks might, in fact, be rendered less safe by the addition of such appliances, not only because of the increased weight but because of the danger of sudden stops. A railroad brake expert in this case spoke of the danger of men being thrown from their open seats on a motor car by quick stops, and the Commission, in its amicus brief, states that \"In the absence of tests showing otherwise, it would seem that power brakes on push trucks towed by a track motor car could well be about as dangerous a device to employees riding on such vehicles as one can imagine.\" P. 20. According to the Commission, protection against collision with trains is better assured by strict enforcement of rules designed to give warning of train movements than by the addition of the safety appliances named in the Acts. In any event, such matters are peculiarly within its competence.\n\nThe Court's decision is directly opposed to the Commission's practice and opinion. It imposes onerous requirements, unrelated to safety, on a large class of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 345]\n\u00a0\n vehicles never before considered subject to the Acts.\n21\n Nothing in the language of the Acts or in their history compels a disregard of the informed judgment of that expert authority which has the responsibility of their administration and enforcement.\n\nI would sustain the view of the Interstate Commerce Commission and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 27 Stat. 531, as amended, 29 Stat. 85, 32 Stat. 943, 36 Stat. 298, 62 Stat. 909, 45 U.S.C. 1-16.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 6, 27 Stat. 532, 45 U.S.C. 6; 4, 36 Stat. 299, 45 U.S.C. 13.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, e. g., Urie v.

Since passenger cars, by 1893, had generally been equipped with the required appliances - train brakes and automatic couplers - they did not present the same hazards to trainmen.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Commission recommended enactment of legislation in 1889 after completing a general investigation of railroad safety conditions. It continued to press for legislation until the enactment of the first Safety Appliance Act in 1893. See Interstate Commerce Commission Activities, 1887-1937 (1937), 118-120; Third Ann. Rep., I. C.

During this period, the Commission has never considered the small maintenance of way vehicles subject to those acts, and we submit that the foregoing contemporary and legislative histories furnish a sound foundation for its view. That legislation is concerned with locomotives, cars and similar vehicles which employees were formerly required to go between to couple, or to ascend to use the hand brake. The acts are designed primarily to reduce or eliminate those hazards. They should not be construed to apply to entirely different types of equipment whose operation does not involve such risks.\" Brief of Interstate Commerce Commission, as amicus curiae, 18-20.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] This order was amended in 1943 and republished in 1946. 49 CFR, 1949, Pt. 131.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] See I.

The 18-foot gasoline tractor which was held to be \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 343]\n\u00a0\n a \"locomotive\" in Hoffman v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 74 F.2d 227, was equipped with an automatic coupler, was used to haul standard railroad cars and was capable of hauling 22 freight cars loaded with cement. Such a vehicle bears little resemblance to the motor track car involved here. United States v. Fort Worth & D.C. R. Co., 21 F. Supp. 916, is even less in point. In that case it was held that a large Browning steam locomotive crane, engaged in hauling standard railroad cars, was a \"locomotive\" and the combination of cars a \"train\" within the meaning of the Acts. The Florida decision, Martin v. Johnston, 79 So.2d 419, lends little support because the state court appears to have been unadvised of the above-stated purpose, legislative history, and administrative interpretation of the Acts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Hertel, History of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes (1955), 212-213.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] See H.

This proviso confirms the view expressed in this dissent that power brakes, automatic couplers, and the other specified appliances are not required of motor track cars and push trucks. The exception, on its face, applies to them as four-wheel vehicles. And, although the legislative history indicates that Congress had four-wheel coal cars primarily in mind, the proviso is not expressly limited to coal cars and is thoroughly consistent with a purpose to exempt from the Acts maintenance vehicles that are not suited to the prescribed safety appliances. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 325, 346]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBANTA v.

A narrower question, the defense of qualified privilege, had been urged in the District Court and the Court of Appeals, but not considered by the Court of Appeals on the ground that it had been waived. Held: Certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court with directions to consider the defense of qualified privilege.

Sweeney and Bernard Cedarbaum for petitioner.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe petition for certiorari is granted. The petition presents this question: \"Whether the absolute immunity from defamation suits accorded officials of the Government with respect to acts done within the scope of their official authority, extends to statements to the press by high policy-making officers, below cabinet or comparable rank, concerning matters committed by law to their control or supervision.\"\n\nIn the District Court and the Court of Appeals the litigation was not so confined. By his motion for a directed verdict and requested instructions petitioner also presented to the District Court the defense of qualified privilege. On appeal to the Court of Appeals petitioner, in his brief, raised only the question of absolute immunity, but on reconsideration he urged the court also \n\n[355 \nU.S. 171, 172]\n\u00a0\n to pass on the defense of qualified privilege. This that court refused to do on the ground that petitioner, because of the position he had initially taken on the appeal, had waived the defense. In so holding, the court relied on its Rule 17 (c) (7), requiring an appellant to set forth in his brief a statement of the points on which he intends to rely, and Rule 17 (i), which provides that \"Points not presented according to the rules of the court, will be disregarded, though the court, at its option, may notice and pass upon a plain error not pointed out or relied upon.\" 244 F.2d 767.\n\nThe scope of the litigation in the Court of Appeals cannot lessen this Court's duty to confine itself to the proper exercise of its jurisdiction and the appropriate scope of judicial review. Thus, an advisory opinion cannot be extracted from a federal court by agreement of the parties, see Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co., \n243 \nU.S. 281, 289\n, and no matter how much they may favor the settlement of an important question of constitutional law, broad considerations of the appropriate exercise of judicial power prevent such determinations unless actually compelled by the litigation before the Court. United States v. C. I. O., \n335 \nU.S. 106, 110\n. Likewise, \"Courts should avoid passing on questions of public law even short of constitutionality that are not immediately pressing. Many of the same reasons are present which impel them to abstain from adjudicating constitutional claims against a statute before it effectively and presently impinges on such claims.\" Eccles v. Peoples Bank, \n333 \nU.S. 426, 432\n. Especially in a case involving on the one hand protection of the reputation of individuals, and on the other the interest of the public in the fullest freedom of officials to make disclosures on matters within the scope of their public duties, this Court should avoid rendering a decision beyond the obvious requirements of the record. In the present case a ground \n\n[355 \nU.S. 171, 173]\n\u00a0\n far narrower than that on which the Court of Appeals rested its decision, the defense of qualified privilege, was consistently pressed in the District Court and in fact urged in the Court of Appeals itself. In these circumstances we think that the broad requirements of judicial power and its proper exercise should lead to consideration of the defense of qualified privilege.\n\nTo that end, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case remanded to that Court with directions to pass upon petitioner's claim of a qualified privilege.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, agrees with the disposition of this case as expressed in the last paragraph.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN would grant the petition and consider the question presented.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that the question of the defense of qualified privilege on which we vacate and remand had been \"waived\" by petitioner and therefore should not be considered by the Court of Appeals under its Rules. That question therefore is not here for us nor should it be reached by the Court of Appeals. I cannot say that the Court of Appeals misconstrued its own Rules\n*\n or committed palpable error in refusing to consider \n\n[355 \nU.S. 171, 174]\n\u00a0\n the question or unceremoniously and improperly reached for a constitutional question which it should have sought to avoid. Under these circumstances it is an unwarranted exercise of our supervisory powers to require that the question be considered by the Court of Appeals. Instead, we should exercise our discretion by denying certiorari.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] \"A concise statement of the points on which appellant intends to rely, set forth in separate, numbered paragraphs.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented by petitioner is whether evidence obtained as the result of wiretapping by state law-enforcement officers, without participation by federal authorities, is admissible in a federal court. Petitioner was convicted of the illegal possession and transportation of distilled spirits without tax stamps affixed thereto in violation of 26 U.S.C. 5008 (b) (1), 5642. The New York police, suspecting that petitioner and others were dealing in narcotics in violation of state law, obtained a warrant in accordance with state law\n1\n authorizing them to tap the wires of a bar which petitioner was known to frequent. On May 10, 1956, the police overheard a conversation between petitioner and another in which it was said that \"eleven pieces\" were to be transported that night at a certain time and to a certain place in New York City. Acting according to this information, the police followed and stopped a car driven by petitioner's brother. No narcotics were found, but hidden in the car were eleven five-gallon cans of alcohol without the tax stamps required by federal law. The brother and the alcohol were turned over to federal authorities and this prosecution followed.\n\nAt the trial the first government witness, a state police officer, testified to the events leading up to the discovery of the cans of alcohol in an automobile which had been driven by the petitioner and then taken by his brother to the appointed spot. No mention was made of the wiretap on direct examination. However, on cross-examination this witness admitted that the information causing the police to follow the car and intercept it came \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n from a wiretap.\n2\n On redirect examination the prosecutor sought to prove that the wiretap had been authorized by state law. The Government introduced a second police official, who testified substantially as the first, admitting on direct examination that a wiretap had existed and on cross-examination that the discovery of the alcohol was occasioned by knowledge of the contents of the wiretapped conversation. The words of that conversation were not disclosed to the jury although they were disclosed to the trial judge and the defense counsel.\n3\n The \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n record is silent as to whether the prosecutor was told the words of the conversation. However, in our view it is unimportant whether he had this information or not.\n\nPetitioner's motion to suppress the evidence was denied and he was convicted. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, 244 F.2d 389, holding that while the action of the state officials violated Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act, the evidence obtained from the violation was still admissible. We granted certiorari. \n355 \nU.S. 801\n. Petitioner, relying on this Court's supervisory powers over the federal court system, claims that the admission of the evidence was barred by the Federal Constitution and Section 605. We do not reach the constitutional questions as this case can be determined under the statute.\n\nSection 605 states in pertinent part:\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\". . . no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person . . . .\"\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIn Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379\n, and \n308 \nU.S. 338\n, this Court held that evidence obtained from wiretapping by federal agents was inadmissible in federal court. In Schwartz v. Texas, \n344 \nU.S. 199\n, the same type \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n of evidence was held admissible in a state court where it had been obtained by state agents. The case before us, containing elements from these three cases, forces a choice between the different results reached.\n\nThe Nardone decisions laid down the underlying premises upon which is based all subsequent consideration of Section 605. The crux of those decisions is that the plain words of the statute created a prohibition against any persons violating the integrity of a system of telephonic communication and that evidence obtained in violation of this prohibition may not be used to secure a federal conviction. Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379, 382\n. Moreover, as the second Nardone decision asserts, distinctions designed to defeat the plain meaning of the statute will not be countenanced. \n308 \nU.S. 338, 340\n. We hold that the correct application of the above principle dictates that evidence obtained by means forbidden by Section 605, whether by state or federal agents, is inadmissible in federal court.\n\nIn this case the statute was violated if not earlier at least upon the disclosure to the jury of the existence of the intercepted communication,\n5\n for Section 605 forbids the divulgence of \"the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning\" of the intercepted message. The effect of that violation in contributing to the conviction here is manifest. The jury were free to speculate that the existence of the communication, the source of the Government's evidence, was further proof of petitioner's \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 101]\n\u00a0\n criminal activities.\n6\n The prosecutor continued to use evidence now linked to a disclosed wiretap although he had been made aware of its existence and of its obvious significance to his case.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nRespondents argue that the evidence obtained from the disclosed wiretap should have been admissible by referring to Schwartz v. Texas, supra, and by drawing a parallel to the Fourth Amendment. It is urged that as long as the wiretapping occurred without the participation or even knowledge of federal law-enforcement officers, the evidence should be admitted in federal court; the Federal Government, being without fault, should not be handicapped. However, Schwartz v. Texas does not indicate approval of such a proposition. Both a state court and state law-enforcement officers were there involved. The rationale of that case is that despite the plain prohibition of Section 605, due regard to federal-state relations precluded the conclusion that Congress intended to thwart a state rule of evidence in the absence of a clear indication to that effect. In the instant \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 102]\n\u00a0\n case we are not dealing with a state rule of evidence. Although state agents committed the wiretap, we are presented with a federal conviction brought about in part by a violation of federal law,\n8\n in this case in a federal court.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, confronted as we are by this clear statute, and resting our decision on its provisions, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to discuss by analogy distinctions suggested to be applicable to the Fourth Amendment.\n10\n Section 605 contains an express, absolute prohibition against the divulgence of intercepted communications. Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379, 382\n. This case is but another example of the use of wiretapping that was so clearly condemned under other circumstances in the second Nardone decision:\n11\n\u00a0\n\n\"To forbid the direct use of [these] methods . . . but to put no curb on their full indirect use would \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 103]\n\u00a0\n only invite the very methods deemed `inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty.' What was said in a different context in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385, 392\n, is pertinent here: `The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the court, but that it shall not be used at all.'\"\n\n\n The above principle has for its purpose enhancement of the proper administration of criminal justice. To impute to the statute anything less would give it \"a self-defeating, if not disingenuous purpose.\"\n12\n Nardone v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 338, 340\n-341.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nAs an alternative argument to support the judgment below, respondent urges that the interception and divulgence in this case were no violation of Section 605 because the wiretap was placed by state agents acting in accordance with the law of New York. The Constitution and statutes of the State of New York\n13\n provide that an ex parte order authorizing a wiretap may be issued by \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 104]\n\u00a0\n judges of a certain rank upon the oath or affirmation of certain officials that there is reasonable ground to believe evidence of a crime may be obtained and which identifies the telephone line and the persons who are to be affected thereby. It is undisputed that an order pursuant to that law was issued in this case and that it was executed according to state law.\n\nRespondent does not urge that, constitutionally speaking, Congress is without power to forbid such wiretapping even in the face of a conflicting state law. Cf. Weiss v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 321, 327\n. Rather the argument is that Congress has not exercised this power and that Section 605, being general in its terms, should not be deemed to operate to prevent a State from authorizing wiretapping in the exercise of its legitimate police functions. However, we read the Federal Communications Act, and Section 605 in particular, to the contrary.\n\nThe Federal Communications Act is a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of interstate communication.\n14\n In order to safeguard those interests protected under Section 605, that portion of the statute pertinent to this case applies both to intrastate and to interstate communications. Weiss v. United States, supra. The natural result of respondent's argument is that both interstate and intrastate communication would be removed from the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 105]\n\u00a0\n statute's protection because, as this Court noted in Weiss,\n15\n the intercepter cannot discern between the two and will listen to both. Congress did not intend to place the protections so plainly guaranteed in Section 605 in such a vulnerable position. Respondent points to portions of the Act which place some limited authority in the States over the field of interstate communication. The character of these matters, dealing with aspects of the regulation of utility service to the public, is technical in nature\n16\n in contrast to the broader policy considerations motivating Section 605.\n17\n Moreover, the very existence of these grants of authority to the States underscores the conclusion that had Congress intended to allow the States to make exceptions to Section 605, it would have said so. In light of the above considerations, and keeping in mind this comprehensive scheme of interstate regulation and the public policy underlying Section 605 as part of that scheme, we find that Congress, setting out a prohibition in plain terms, did not mean to allow state legislation which would contradict that section and that \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 106]\n\u00a0\n policy.\n18\n Cf. Pennsylvania v. Nelson, \n350 \nU.S. 497\n; Hill v. Florida, \n325 \nU.S. 538\n; Hines v. Davidowitz, \n312 \nU.S. 52\n.\n19\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] N.

Part of the information.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] R. 52: \"(The following took place in the absence of the jury:)\n\n\"THE COURT: Mr. Todaro, the assistant district attorney is here with the order of the [state] court [authorizing the wiretap]. I just tell you, Mr. Todaro, I have looked at it and it does provide for the tap of these premises, so that your concession [that the tap \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n was authorized under state law], generally made, was actually well based.\n\n\n\"Also, for whatever factual interest it may have on this motion, Mr. Murphy overheard the conversation that night, if you want to get the full facts on that.\n\n\n\"The reference on the wire was to `eleven pieces' which they thought meant narcotics, and that was why they intercepted the car.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 48 Stat. 1103, 47 U.S.C. 605.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Because both an interception and a divulgence are present in this case we need not decide whether both elements are necessary for a violation of 605. Also because here the disclosure was of the existence of the communication, it is not necessary for us to reach the issue whether 605 is violated by an interception of the communication and a divulgence of its fruits without divulging the existence, contents, etc., of the communication.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The obvious prejudice to the petitioner from the disclosure of the wiretap is shown by efforts of the prosecution to mitigate it by showing that the wiretap had not been instigated on account of the charge for which petitioner was being tried. However, disclosure of the existence of the communication was the prejudicial error that was not overcome.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The heart of the Government's case was (1) the testimony of the two policemen, who were present at the scene of the wiretap and at least one of whom arrested petitioner's brother and discovered the alcohol, and (2) the evidence of a government chemist as to his analysis of the seized alcohol. As the Court of Appeals below said: \"But it is equally clear that but for the wiretap there would have been no basis for any prosecution whatever, as the apprehension of Angelo [petitioner's brother] and seizure of the `eleven pieces' led to the discovery of appellant's participation in the violations of federal law for which he has been convicted; and the sequence of cause and effect is clear.\" 244 F.2d, at 390.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] A complementary distinction was made in Rea v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 214\n. There this Court reversed the denial of an injunction against a federal agent who had seized evidence in violation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and, being unable to introduce the evidence in federal court, was about to do so in a state prosecution. In answer to the argument that such an injunction would interfere with state judicial procedure, the decision states: \"The command of the federal Rules is in no way affected by anything that happens in a state court. They are designed as standards for federal agents. The fact that their violation may be condoned by state practice has no relevancy to our problem.\" Id., at 217.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The first divulgence appearing on the record occurred in court, but we do not mean to imply that an out-of-court violation of the statute would not also lead to the invalidation of a subsequent conviction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] It has remained an open question in this Court whether evidence obtained solely by state agents in an illegal search may be admissible in federal court despite the Fourth Amendment. See Lustig v. United States, \n338 \nU.S. 74, 78\n-79. The instant decision is not concerned with the scope of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] \n308 \nU.S., at 340\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Goldstein v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 114\n, is not to the contrary. The holding of that decision is that one not a party to an intercepted conversation may not bar the testimony of one who has been induced to testify by exposure of the fact that his own conversations have been wiretapped. Id., at 122. The broad language in the decision that the policy of the Fourth Amendment applies to 605 is placed in the context of a discussion of the right of one not a party to the conversation to complain. Id., at 120, 121. This right was rejected on the ground that since the statute allows the \"sender\" of a message to consent to its divulgence, it meant to protect only him.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] N. Y. Const., Art. I, 12; N. Y. Code of Criminal Procedure, 813-a (1942).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The Federal Communications Act was the response to a Presidential message calling to the attention of Congress the disjointed exercise of federal authority over the forms of communication. The primary purpose of the Act was to create a commission \"to regulate all forms of communication and to consider needed additional legislation.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1850, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 3. Note also the remarks of Senator Dill, Chairman of the Committee on Interstate Commerce, who introduced the bill in the Senate, that the Act would correct the theretofore cursory federal regulation of telephone and telegraph companies. 78 Cong.

See H. R. Rep. No. 1850, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 7. 47 U.S.C. 221 (b), as originally enacted, enabled state commissions \"to regulate exchange services in metropolitan areas overlapping State lines.\" S. Rep. No. 781, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 5; H. R. Rep. No. 1850, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 7. State authority over intrastate communication is reserved by 47 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 152 (b), which removes the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission from \"charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or regulations for or in connection with intrastate communication service by wire or radio of any carrier.\" See S.

United States, \n308 \nU.S. 321\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] In passing, it should be pointed out that several Attorneys General of the United States have urged Congress to grant exceptions to 605 to federal agents under limited circumstances. See, e. g., Hearings before Subcommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on the Judiciary on H. R. 762, 867, 4513, 4728, 5096, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 28; Rogers, The Case for Wire Tapping, 63 Yale L. J. 792 (1954). But Congress has declined to do so. In view of this, it would seem unreasonable to believe that Congress is willing to allow this same sort of exception to state agents with no further legislation on its part.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Schwartz v. Texas, supra, is not to the contrary. While it refused to overturn a state rule of evidence, the Court was satisfied that the action of the state officials nonetheless violated 605. \n344 \nU.S., at 202\n. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 96, 107]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBENZ v.

With him on the brief was Lofton L. Tatum.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWhile the petitioners in this diversity case present several questions, the sole one decided is whether the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947\n1\n applies to a \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 139]\n\u00a0\n controversy involving damages resulting from the picketing of a foreign ship operated entirely by foreign seamen under foreign articles while the vessel is temporarily in an American port. We decide that it does not, and therefore do not reach other questions raised by the parties.\n\nThe S. S. Riviera on September 3, 1952, sailed into harbor at Portland, Oregon, for repairs, to load a cargo of wheat, and to complete an insurance survey. It was owned by respondent, a Panamanian corporation, and sailed under a Liberian flag. The crew was made up entirely of nationals of countries other than the United States, principally German and British. They had agreed to serve on a voyage originating at Bremen, Germany, for a period of two years, or until the vessel returned to a European port. A British form of articles of agreement was opened at Bremen. The conditions prescribed by the British Maritime Board were incorporated into the agreement, including wages and hours of employment, all of which were specifically set out. The crew further agreed to obey all lawful commands of the Master of the Riviera in regard to the ship, the stores, and the cargo, whether on board, in boats, or on shore.\n\nOn or about September 9, 1952, the members of the crew went on strike on board the vessel and refused to obey the orders of the Master. They demanded that their term of service be reduced, their wages be increased, and more favorable conditions of employment be granted.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 140]\n\u00a0\n They refused to work, demanding their back pay and transportation or its cost to their ports of engagement. The Master told the crew to continue their work or they would be discharged. When they declined to work he discharged them and ordered them to leave the ship, which they refused to do. This situation continued until September 26, 1952, when the striking crewmen left the vessel pursuant to an order of the United States District Court entered in a possessory libel filed by the respondent. The crew had picketed the vessel from September 9, 1952, when the strike began, until September 26, when they left the ship. On September 15, 1952, they had designated the Sailors' Union of the Pacific as their collective bargaining representative. The striking crew or others acting for them continued the picketing from September 26, 1952, until they withdrew the picket line on October 13, 1952. The Sailors' Union of the Pacific began picketing the Riviera on October 14 and continued to do so until restrained by an injunction issued in an action for injunctive relief and damages filed against it and its principal representatives by the respondent. Two days later Local 90 of the National Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots of America set up a picket line at the Riviera which was maintained until December 8, 1952. This picketing was stopped by a writ issued against that union and its representatives in the second action for injunction and damages filed by respondent and consolidated here. On December 10, 1952, another picket line was established at the vessel. It was maintained this time by the Atlantic and Gulf Coast District, S. I. U.,\n3\n until it too was enjoined on December 12 in a third action filed by the respondent in which the prayer likewise was for an injunction \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 141]\n\u00a0\n and damages. These three cases have been consolidated for consideration here. All of the picketing was peaceful.\n\nThe ship sailed in December 1952. In June 1953, the injunction orders were vacated on appeal to the Court of Appeals and were ordered dismissed as moot. The cases were returned to the District Court for trial on the damage claims. 205 F.2d 944. The ship had not returned to an American port at the time of trial in 1954. At the trial the court found that the purpose of the picketing \"was to compel the [respondent] to re-employ\" the striking members of the crew for a shorter term and at more favorable wage rates and conditions than those agreed upon in the articles. The court further found that as a result of the picketing the employees of the firms repairing and loading the vessel refused to cross the picket line and the ship was forced to stand idly by without repairs or cargo, all to the damage of respondent. The unions and their representatives contended that the trial court was without jurisdiction because the Labor Management Relations Act had pre-empted the field. However, the trial court entered judgment for damages against the three unions as well as their principal representatives. The judgments were based on a common-law theory that the picketing was for an unlawful purpose under Oregon law. The court found that respondent had no remedy under the Labor Management Relations Act because that Act \"is concerned solely with the labor relations of American workers between American concerns and their employees in the United States, and it is not intended to, nor does it cover a dispute between a foreign ship and its foreign crew.\" The Court of Appeals thought that United Construction Workers v. Laburnum Construction Corp., \n347 \nU.S. 656\n (1954), governed, but that Oregon law did not permit recovery against the unions since they were unincorporated \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n associations. 233 F.2d 62.\n4\n This, in effect, left the judgments standing against the individual representatives of the unions, the petitioners here. We granted certiorari in order to settle the important question of jurisdiction posed. \n352 \nU.S. 889\n.\n\nIt should be noted at the outset that the dispute from which these actions sprang arose on a foreign vessel. It was between a foreign employer and a foreign crew operating under an agreement made abroad under the laws of another nation. The only American connection was that the controversy erupted while the ship was transiently in a United States port and American labor unions participated in its picketing.\n\nIt is beyond question that a ship voluntarily entering the territorial limits of another country subjects itself to the laws and jurisdiction of that country. Wildenhus's Case, \n120 \nU.S. 1\n (1887). The exercise of that jurisdiction is not mandatory but discretionary. Often, because of public policy or for other reasons, the local sovereign may exert only limited jurisdiction and sometimes none at all. Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 100\n (1923). It follows that if Congress had so chosen, it could have made the Act applicable to wage disputes arising on foreign vessels between nationals of other countries when the vessel comes within our territorial waters. The question here therefore narrows to one of intent of the Congress as to the coverage of the Act.\n\nThe parties point to nothing in the Act itself or its legislative history that indicates in any way that the Congress intended to bring such disputes within the coverage of the Act. Indeed the District Court found to the contrary, specifically stating that the Act does not \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 143]\n\u00a0\n \"cover a dispute between a foreign ship and its foreign crew.\" The Court of Appeals, though not passing on the question, noted that \"It may well be that American laws should not be construed to apply, without some more explicit Congressional indication than we are able to find in the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, to situations with as many points of foreign contact as the situation at bar.\" 233 F.2d, at 65.\n\nOur study of the Act leaves us convinced that Congress did not fashion it to resolve labor disputes between nationals of other countries operating ships under foreign laws.\n5\n The whole background of the Act is concerned with \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n industrial strife between American employers and employees. In fact, no discussion in either House of Congress has been called to our attention from the thousands of pages of legislative history that indicates in the least that Congress intended the coverage of the Act to extend to circumstances such as those posed here. It appears not to have even occurred to those sponsoring the bill. The Report made to the House by its Committee on Education and Labor and presented by the coauthor of the bill, Chairman Hartley, stated that \"the bill herewith reported has been formulated as a bill of rights both for American workingmen and for their employers.\" The report declares further that because of the inadequacies of legislation \"the American workingman has been deprived of his dignity as an individual,\" and that it is the purpose of the bill to correct these inadequacies. (Emphasis added.) H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 4. What was said inescapably describes the boundaries of the Act as including only the workingmen of our own country and its possessions.\n\nThe problem presented is not a new one to the Congress. In the Seamen's Act of March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1164, the Congress declared it unlawful to pay a seaman wages in advance and specifically declared the prohibition applicable to foreign vessels \"while in waters of the United States.\" Id., at 1169, as amended, 46 U.S.C. 599 (e). In Sandberg v. McDonald, \n248 \nU.S. 185\n (1918), this Court construed the Act as not covering advancements \"when the contract and payment were made in a foreign country where the law sanctioned such contract and payment. . . . Had Congress \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 145]\n\u00a0\n intended to make void such contracts and payments a few words would have stated that intention, not leaving such an important regulation to be gathered from implication.\" Id., at 195. The Court added that \"such sweeping and important requirement is not found specifically made in the statute.\" Ibid. See also Neilson v. Rhine Shipping Co., \n248 \nU.S. 205\n (1918). In 1920 Congress amended 4 of the Seamen's Act of 1915, and granted to every seaman on a vessel of the United States the right to demand one-half of his then earned wages at every port the vessel entered during a voyage. 41 Stat. 1006, 46 U.S.C. 597. The section was made applicable to \"seamen on foreign vessels while in harbors of the United States, and the courts of the United States shall be open to such seamen for its enforcement.\" This Court in Strathearn Steamship Co. v. Dillon, \n252 \nU.S. 348\n (1920), upheld the applicability of the section to a British seaman on a British vessel under British articles. The Court pointed out:\n\n\"taking the provisions of the act as the same are written, we think it plain that it manifests the purpose of Congress to place American and foreign seamen on an equality of right in so far as the privileges of this section are concerned, with equal opportunity to resort to the courts of the United States for the enforcement of the act. Before the amendment . . . the right to recover one-half the wages could not be enforced in face of a contractual obligation to the contrary. Congress, for reasons which it deemed sufficient, amended the act so as to permit the recovery upon the conditions named in the statute.\" Id., at 355.\n\n\n In 1928, Jackson v. S. S. Archimedes, \n275 \nU.S. 463\n, was decided by this Court. It involved advance payments made by a British vessel to foreign seamen before leaving \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n Manchester on her voyage to New York and return. It was contended that the advances made in Manchester were illegal and void. That there was \"no intention to extend the provisions of the statute,\" the Court said, \"to advance payments made by foreign vessels while in foreign ports, is plain. This Court had pointed out in the Sandberg case [supra] that such a sweeping provision was not specifically made in the statute . . . .\" Id., at 470. Soon thereafter several proposals were made in Congress designed to extend the coverage of the Seamen's Act so as to prohibit advancements made by foreign vessels in foreign ports. A storm of diplomatic protest resulted. Great Britain, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, and Canada all joined in vigorously denouncing the proposals.\n6\n In each instance the bills died in Congress.\n\nAnd so here such a \"sweeping provision\" as to foreign applicability was not specified in the Act.\n7\n The seamen agreed in Germany to work on the foreign ship under British articles. We cannot read into the Labor Management Relations Act an intent to change the contractual \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 147]\n\u00a0\n provisions made by these parties. For us to run interference in such a delicate field of international relations there must be present the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed. It alone has the facilities necessary to make fairly such an important policy decision where the possibilities of international discord are so evident and retaliative action so certain. We, therefore, conclude that any such appeal should be directed to the Congress rather than the courts.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C. 141.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The demands were first transmitted to the Master on September 7, 1952, by a person identifying himself as a delegate of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific. None of the crew belonged to that union. At 3 a. m. on September 8, 1952, the same party and some of the crew members called on the Master in his cabin. They demanded that he come to the crew's quarters and bargain with them on wages and conditions on the ship. This demand was refused. While claim was made that filthy conditions existed aboard and contaminated food was served, the court, after hearing evidence and personally inspecting the vessel, found to the contrary. There is no issue here as to these findings.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] None of the crew were members of any of the three unions involved in the intermittent picketing.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] A cross-petition for certiorari was filed for a review of this question. The petition was denied. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., v. Benz, \n352 \nU.S. 890\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Petitioners rely on two cases to bolster their argument that the Act applies to a foreign dispute such as the one here. We need only say that these cases are inapposite, without, of course, intimating any view as to their result. First petitioners seek support in Sailors' Union of the Pacific, AFL and Moore Dry Dock Co., 92 N. L. R. B. 547 (1950). That case, however, was brought to the Board by an American employer, the owner of the drydock, claiming that the picketing by an American Sailors' Union was of the dry-dock and constituted a secondary boycott and therefore an unfair labor practice. The Board in its opinion gave no indication that it felt that the Taft-Hartley Act was intended to apply to a dispute involving employment aboard a foreign vessel. In fact, in a fore-runner of that same case, Compania Maritima Sansoc Limitada, Case No. 20-RC-809, May 1, 1950, CCH NLRB Decisions, 1950-1951, \u00a7 10,081, a petition to represent employees on a Panamanian vessel manned by foreign seamen, and owned by a Panama corporation, the majority of whose stockholders were citizens of foreign countries, was dismissed on the ground that the internal economy of a vessel of foreign registry and ownership was involved. The Board thus made it clear that it would not assume jurisdiction when a foreign vessel was involved. It did assume jurisdiction in the later dispute because that dispute was between an American employer and an American union.\n\nThe second case on which petitioners rely is Norris Grain Co. v. Seafarers' International Union, 232 Minn. 91, 46 N. W. 2d 94 (1950). There a suit for an injunction was brought by the American owner of a grain elevator in Duluth, Minn., charging an American union and its affiliate with a secondary boycott by picketing, not of a foreign \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n vessel, but of the grain elevator. Though a Canadian union (affiliated with the American union) was joined as a defendant, the action ran between an American plaintiff-employer and an American defendant-union. There was no claim by the foreign vessel owner against a union.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 1 U.S. Foreign Rel.: 1928 at 830-838 (Dept. State 1942); id.: 1929 at 1005-1009 (Dept. State 1943); id.: 1931 at 808-814 (Dept. State 1946); id.: 1932 at 959-960 (Dept. State 1948).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] As far back as 1856 this Court was faced with a related problem. In Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183 (1857), in construing our patent laws which were silent as to their coverage of foreign ships in our ports, the Court held that Congress had expressed no intention of subjecting the use of improvements on foreign vessels stopping at our ports to our patent laws. In this regard the Court said: \"We think these laws ought to be construed in the spirit in which they were made - that is, as founded in justice - and should not be strained by technical constructions to reach cases which Congress evidently could not have contemplated, without departing from the principle upon which they were legislating, and going far beyond the object they intended to accomplish.\" Id., at 197.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nThe case involves a contest between American unions and a foreign ship. The foreign ship came to Portland, Oregon, to load a cargo of wheat for carriage to India. The crew members were paid about one-third the amount of cash wages that are paid to American seamen on American vessels carrying grain to the Orient. This foreign ship is in competition with those American vessels.\n\nAmerican unions, therefore, have a vital interest in the working conditions and wages of the seamen aboard this foreign vessel. Their interest is in the re-employment of the foreign crew at better wages and working conditions. And they peacefully picketed the foreign vessel to further that interest.\n\nThe judgment we sustain today is one in damages against members of the American union who engaged in that peaceful picketing. It is for conduct precisely regulated by the Taft-Hartley Act.\n\nIf, as the District Court found, the purpose of the picketing was to prevent the repairing and loading of the foreign vessel, the question then arises whether the peaceful \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 148]\n\u00a0\n picketing was not a secondary boycott condemned by 303 (a) (1) of the Act.\n\nIf the purpose of the peaceful picketing was to force the foreign vessels to bargain with one of the American unions without any of them being first certified as the representative of the seamen, the question arises whether that was not a violation of 303 (a) (2) of the Act.\n\nIf either 303 (a) (1) or 303 (a) (2) was violated, then the injured person may sue in the federal courts for damages, as provided in 303 (b). The Court bases its decision that the Act is inapplicable on the conclusion that the underlying controversy was between the foreign vessel and its crew. It intimates, however, that the Act would apply if this suit had been brought by the American independent contractors whose employees refused to cross the picket line, although the identical conduct by the American unions were involved. But, even if we assume arguendo that the foreign vessel would not be subject to the regulatory provisions of the Act, it could nonetheless sue under 303 (b) to get protection from any unfair labor practice condemned by the Act. That is indeed the force of our ruling in Teamsters Union v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., \n350 \nU.S. 155, 160\n-161.\n\nThe Labor Board has asserted jurisdiction over unions that bring their pressures to bear on vessels of foreign registry (In the matter of Sailors' Union of the Pacific, 92 N. L. R. B. 547), at the same time that it has declined to assume jurisdiction over the foreign vessel.\n1\n Id., at 560-561. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 149]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf there is to be peace along the waterfront and a full and free flow of commerce as declared in 1 of the Act, these American unions should be subject only to disciplinary action by the federal agencies to whom Congress has entrusted the job of law enforcement.\n2\n Only by applying those centralized controls can we avoid the \"diversities and conflicts likely to result from a variety of local procedures and attitudes toward labor controversies.\" Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485, 490\n.\n\nThere is no hiatus in the federal regulatory scheme as was true in United Workers v. Laburnum Corp., \n347 \nU.S. 656\n. The facts alleged in the complaint, if true, might constitute unfair labor practices under the Act; and Congress has provided, as against American unions, both an \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 150]\n\u00a0\n administrative remedy and a remedy by way of damages. I see no answer therefore to the conclusion that state law has been pre-empted by federal law within the meaning of our decision in Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468\n.\n\nIf American unions or their members are to be mulcted in damages for unfair labor practices affecting commerce, Congress has provided the way in which it shall be done.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Sailors' Union of the Pacific picketed the main gate of a San Francisco shipyard, where a ship of foreign registry and ownership was undergoing repairs, after the owner of the vessel refused to recognize the union as exclusive representative of the crew. After the picketing began, the union filed, with the Board's Regional Office, a petition to be certified as the representative of the vessel's crew. As \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 149]\n\u00a0\n noted by the Court, the Board's Regional Director administratively dismissed the petition, \"inasmuch as the internal economy of a vessel of foreign registry and ownership is involved.\" The Board sustained the Regional Director's action on the ground that it had no jurisdiction over the foreign owner of the vessel. The Board, however, assumed jurisdiction over an unfair labor practice complaint, issued against the union by the same Regional Director, charging that the picketing violated 8 (b) (4) (A) of the Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] That was the conclusion of the Minnesota Supreme Court in a situation similar to this one. An American union and a Canadian union picketed the dock of an American grain company to prevent the loading and unloading of vessels owned by a Canadian company, which had served notice that it would cease to recognize the Canadian union as bargaining representative for its crews. In a suit by the grain company against both unions, the Minnesota Supreme Court concluded that the state courts had no jurisdiction over the dispute which was governed by the Federal Act. \"This action is directed not against the relationship between the Canadian Company and its employes or its relationship with the Canadian Union, but against acts of defendants done in the United States, and neither seeks to regulate the relationship between the Canadian Company and its employes or the Canadian Company and the Canadian Union.\" Norris Grain Co. v. Seafarers' International Union, 232 Minn. 91, 109, 46 N. W. 2d 94, 104. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 138, 151]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLACK v.

Held: This exacted a \"quota\" from the retailers and, to that extent, excluded sales by competing wholesalers, in violation of 5 of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, and it subjected the offending wholesaler to a suspension of its wholesale liquor permit issued under the Act.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin and Assistant Attorney General Hansen.\n\nMoise S. Steeg, Jr. argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner seeks to suspend respondent's wholesale liquor permit issued under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (49 Stat. 977, 27 U.S.C. 201) for having made \"quota\" sales of alcoholic beverages in violation of 5 (a) and (b) of the Act. The agency ordered suspension of the permit for 15 days for that violation. The Court of Appeals set the order aside, 231 F.2d 941. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari, which we granted (\n352 \nU.S. 877\n) because of a conflict between the decision below and Distilled Brands v. Dunigan, 222 F.2d 867, from the Second Circuit. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 24, 25]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 5 makes it unlawful for a wholesaler to induce a retailer to purchase distilled spirits \"to the exclusion in whole or in part of distilled spirits\" offered by other persons \"by requiring the retailer to take and dispose of a certain quota of any of such products,\" where, inter alia, the effect is \"substantially to restrain or prevent transactions in interstate or foreign commerce in any such products.\"\n\nThe facts are that during the period in question Johnny Walker Scotch and Seagram's V. O. Whiskey were in short supply, while Seagram's Ancient Bottle Gin and Seagram's 7-Crown Whiskey were plentiful, Ancient Bottle being a poor seller. Respondent, in order to increase its sales of Ancient Bottle Gin and 7-Crown Whiskey, compelled retailers to buy them, which they did not desire, in order to obtain the other two whiskeys which they did desire. The agency found that respondent's sales were \"quota\" sales within the meaning of the Act, that they affected adversely the sales of competing brands, and \"excluded, in whole or in part, distilled spirits . . . offered for sale by other persons in interstate commerce\" - all to the end of substantially restraining and preventing commerce. The Court of Appeals concluded that the transactions complained of, although tie-in sales, did not violate 5 of the Act.\n\nTying agreements by which the sale of one commodity is conditioned on the purchase of another have been repeatedly condemned under the antitrust laws, since they serve no purpose beyond the suppression of competition. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 293, 305\n-306; United States v. Paramount Pictures, \n334 \nU.S. 131, 156\n-159; International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392\n; Mercoid Corp. v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Co., \n320 \nU.S. 680\n. One aim of Congress by the present legislation was to prohibit practices that were \"analogous to those prohibited by the antitrust laws,\" (see H. R. Rep. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 24, 26]\n\u00a0\n No. 1542, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 12). The tie-in sales involved here seem to us to run afoul of that policy, since the retailer is coerced into buying distilled spirits he would otherwise not have purchased at that time, and other sellers of the products are to that extent excluded from the market that would exist when the demand arose. A wholesaler who compels a retailer to buy an unwanted inventory as a condition to acquisition of needed articles exacts a \"quota\" from the retailer and excludes sales by competing wholesalers in the statutory sense.\n\nThe court below relied on two countervailing considerations. It noted that 5 (a) is headed \"Exclusive outlet\" and 5 (b) \"Tied house.\" These titles were enough, it thought, to raise doubts concerning the meaning of the statutory clauses, since the retailer in question was not a \"tied house\" or \"exclusive outlet,\" but only the victim of these particular tied-in sales. The court was constrained to read the Act narrowly, as it conceived it to be penal in nature when it forfeited a permit to do business. But we deal here with remedial legislation whose language should be given hospitable scope. See Securities and Exchange Commission v. Joiner Corp., \n320 \nU.S. 344, 353\n, 355. The will of Congress would be thwarted if we gave the language in question the strictest construction possible. The fair meaning of the Act is our guide; and it seems too clear for extended argument that the tied-in sale, though it falls short of creating an exclusive outlet and a permanently \"tied house,\" violates the Act.\n\nThe other consideration relied upon by the Court of Appeals was a letter written by the agency to Congress in 1947 asking for an amendment to 5 because it had doubt \"whether violations of the statute could be established through the `tie-in' sales.\" The administrative practice, we are advised, has quite consistently reflected the view that such sales are banned by the Act. See Annual Report, Commissioner of Internal Revenue 1946, \n\n[355 \nU.S. 24, 27]\n\u00a0\n pp. 45-46; id., 1947, p. 49. The fact that the agency sought a clarifying amendment is, therefore, of no significance. See Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, \n339 \nU.S. 33, 47\n; United States v. Turley, \n352 \nU.S. 407, 415\n, n. 14.

Billhymer, Assistant Attorney General, and Dean S. Zinn.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, while driving a pickup truck on the highways of New Mexico, was involved in a collision with a passenger car. Three occupants of the car were killed and petitioner was seriously injured. A pint whiskey bottle, almost empty, was found in the glove compartment of the pickup truck. Petitioner was taken to a hospital and while he was lying unconscious in the emergency room the smell of liquor was detected on his breath. A state patrolman requested that a sample of petitioner's blood be taken. An attending physician, while petitioner was unconscious, withdrew a sample of about 20 cubic centimeters of blood by use of a hypodermic needle. This sample was delivered to the patrolman and subsequent laboratory analysis showed this blood to contain about .17% alcohol.\n\nPetitioner was thereafter charged with involuntary manslaughter. Testimony regarding the blood test and its result was admitted into evidence at trial over petitioner's objection. This included testimony of an expert that a person with .17% alcohol in his blood was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Petitioner was convicted and sentenced for involuntary manslaughter. He did not appeal the conviction. Subsequently, however, he sought release from his imprisonment by a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the Supreme Court of New Mexico.\n1\n That court, after argument, denied the writ. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 434]\n\u00a0\n 58 N. M. 385, 271 P.2d 827 (1954). Petitioner contends that his conviction, based on the result of the involuntary blood test, deprived him of his liberty without that due process of law guaranteed him by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. We granted certiorari, \n351 \nU.S. 906\n, to determine whether the requirements of the Due Process Clause, as it concerns state criminal proceedings, necessitate the invalidation of the conviction.\n\nIt has been clear since Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n (1914), that evidence obtained in violation of rights protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution must be excluded in federal criminal prosecutions. There is argument on behalf of petitioner that the evidence used here, the result of the blood test, was obtained in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that the taking was the result of an unreasonable search and seizure violative of the Fourth Amendment. Likewise, he argues that by way of the Fourteenth Amendment there has been a violation of the Fifth Amendment in that introduction of the test result compelled him to be a witness against himself. Petitioner relies on the proposition that \"the generative principles\" of the Bill of Rights should extend the protections of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to his case through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25\n (1949), answers this contention in the negative. See also Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78\n (1908); Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319\n (1937); Irvine v. California, \n347 \nU.S. 128\n (1954). New Mexico has rejected, as it may, the exclusionary rule set forth in Weeks, supra. State v. Dillon, 34 N. M. 366, 281 P. 474 (1929). Therefore, the rights petitioner claims afford no aid to him here for the fruits of the violations, if any, are admissible in the State's prosecution. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 435]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner's remaining and primary assault on his conviction is not so easily unhorsed. He urges that the conduct of the state officers here offends that \"sense of justice\" of which we spoke in Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165\n (1952). In that case state officers broke into the home of the accused and observed him place something in his mouth. The officers forced open his mouth after considerable struggle in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve whatever was put there. A stomach pump was later forcibly used and among the matter extracted from his stomach were found narcotic pills. As we said there, \"this course of proceeding by agents of government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities.\" Id., at 172. We set aside the conviction because such conduct \"shocked the conscience\" and was so \"brutal\" and \"offensive\" that it did not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency. We therefore found that the conduct was offensive to due process. But we see nothing comparable here to the facts in Rochin.\n\nBasically the distinction rests on the fact that there is nothing \"brutal\" or \"offensive\" in the taking of a sample of blood when done, as in this case, under the protective eye of a physician. To be sure, the driver here was unconscious when the blood was taken, but the absence of conscious consent, without more, does not necessarily render the taking a violation of a constitutional right;\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 436]\n\u00a0\n and certainly the test as administered here would not be considered offensive by even the most delicate. Furthermore, due process is not measured by the yardstick of personal reaction or the sphygmogram of the most sensitive person, but by that whole community sense of \"decency and fairness\" that has been woven by common experience into the fabric of acceptable conduct. It is on this bedrock that this Court has established the concept of due process. The blood test procedure has become routine in our everyday life. It is a ritual for those going into the military service as well as those applying for marriage licenses. Many colleges require such tests before permitting entrance and literally millions of us have voluntarily gone through the same, though a longer, routine in becoming blood donors. Likewise, we note that a majority of our States have either enacted statutes in some form authorizing tests of this nature or permit findings so obtained to be admitted in evidence.\n3\n We therefore conclude \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 437]\n\u00a0\n that a blood test taken by a skilled technician is not such \"conduct that shocks the conscience,\" Rochin, supra, at 172, nor such a method of obtaining evidence that it offends a \"sense of justice,\" Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278, 285\n-286 (1936).\n4\n This is not to say that the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 438]\n\u00a0\n indiscriminate taking of blood under different conditions or by those not competent to do so may not amount to such \"brutality\" as would come under the Rochin rule. The chief law-enforcement officer of New Mexico, while at the Bar of this Court, assured us that every proper medical precaution is afforded an accused from whom blood is taken.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 439]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe test upheld here is not attacked on the ground of any basic deficiency or of injudicious application, but admittedly is a scientifically accurate method of detecting alcoholic content in the blood, thus furnishing an exact measure upon which to base a decision as to intoxication. Modern community living requires modern scientific methods of crime detection lest the public go unprotected. The increasing slaughter on our highways, most of which should be avoidable, now reaches the astounding figures only heard of on the battlefield.\n6\n The States, through safety measures, modern scientific methods, and strict enforcement of traffic laws, are using all reasonable means to make automobile driving less dangerous.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nAs against the right of an individual that his person be held inviolable, even against so slight an intrusion as is involved in applying a blood test of the kind to which millions of Americans submit as a matter of course nearly every day, must be set the interests of society in the scientific determination of intoxication, one of the great causes of the mortal hazards of the road. And the more so since the test likewise may establish innocence, thus affording protection against the treachery of judgment based on one or more of the senses. Furthermore, since our criminal law is to no small extent justified by the assumption of deterrence, the individual's right to immunity from such invasion of the body as is involved in a properly safeguarded blood test is far outweighed by the value of its deterrent effect due to public realization that the issue of driving while under the influence of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 440]\n\u00a0\n alcohol can often by this method be taken out of the confusion of conflicting contentions.\n\nFor these reasons the judgment is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner sought and was denied a writ of habeas corpus from the District Court for Santa Fe County, New Mexico, on March 7, 1952.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It might be a fair assumption that a driver on the highways, in obedience to a policy of the State, would consent to have a blood test made as a part of a sensible and civilized system protecting himself as well as other citizens not only from the hazards of the road due to drunken driving, but also from some use of dubious lay testimony. In fact, the State of Kansas has by statute declared that any person who operates a motor vehicle on the public highways of that State shall be deemed to have given his consent to submit to a chemical \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 436]\n\u00a0\n test of his breath, blood, urine, or saliva for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his blood. If, after arrest for operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the arresting officer has reasonable grounds for the arrest, and the driver refuses to submit to the test, the arresting officer must report this fact to the proper official who shall suspend the operator's permit. Kan. Gen. Stat., 1949 (Supp. 1955), 8-1001 through 8-1007.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Forty-seven States use chemical tests, including blood tests, to aid in the determination of intoxication in cases involving charges of driving while under the influence of alcohol. Twenty-three of these States sanction the use of the tests by statute. These, for the most part, are patterned after 11-902 of the Uniform Vehicle Code prepared by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances. This section makes it unlawful to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The finding of the presence of a certain percentage of alcohol, by weight, in the blood of a person gives rise to a presumption that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

Other States have accepted the use of chemical tests for intoxication without statutory authority but with court approval. See, e. g., People v. Haeussler, 41 Cal. 2d 252, 260 P.2d 8 (1953) (blood); Block v. People, 125 Colo. 36, 240 P.2d 512 (1951) (blood); Touchton v. Florida, 154 Fla. 547, 18 So.2d 752 (1944) (blood); Illinois v. Bobczyk, 343 Ill. App. 504, 99 N. E. 2d 567 (1951) (breath); Iowa v. Haner, 231 Iowa 348, 1 N. W. 2d 91 (1941) (blood); Breithaupt v. Abram, 58 N. M. 385, 271 P.2d 827 (1954) (blood); Bowden v. State, 95 Okla. Cr. 382, 246 P.2d 427 (1952) (blood and urine); McKay v. State, 155 Tex. Cr. R. 416, 235 S. W. 2d 173 (1950) (breath). Still other States accept the practice of the use of chemical tests for intoxication though there does not appear to have been litigation on the problem. See the summary in a report of the Committee on Tests for Intoxication of the National Safety Council, 1955 Uses of Chemical Tests for Intoxication.\n\nThe fact that so many States make use of the tests negatives the suggestion that there is anything offensive about them. For additional discussion of the use of these blood tests see Inbau, Self-Incrimination (1950), 72-86.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Several States have considered the very problem here presented but none have found that the conduct of the state authorities was \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 438]\n\u00a0\n so offensive as to necessitate reversal of convictions based in part on blood tests. People v. Duroncelay, 146 A. Cal. App. 96, 303 P.2d 617 (1956); Block v. People, 125 Colo. 36, 240 P.2d 512 (1951); State v. Ayres, 70 Idaho 18, 211 P.2d 142 (1949) (test results were favorable to accused); State v. Cram, 176 Ore. 577, 160 P.2d 283 (1945). See also State v. Sturtevant, 96 N. H. 99, 70 A. 2d 909 (1950); cf. United States v. Williamson, 4 U.S.C. M. A. 320, 15 C. M. R. 320 (1954). But see Iowa v. Weltha, 228 Iowa 519, 292 N. W. 148 (1940); Wisconsin v. Kroening, 274 Wis. 266, 79 N. W. 2d 810 (1956). But cf. United States v. Jordan, 7 U.S.C. M. A. 452, 22 C. M. R. 242 (1957).\n\nThe withdrawal of blood for use in blood-grouping tests in state criminal prosecutions is widespread. See, e. g., Maryland v. Davis, 189 Md. 640, 57 A. 2d 289 (1948); New Jersey v. Alexander, 7 N. J. 585, 83 A. 2d 441 (1951); Commonwealth v. Statti, 166 Pa. Super. 577, 73 A. 2d 688 (1950).\n\nMany States authorize blood tests in civil actions such as paternity proceedings. See, e. g., the discussion in Cortese v. Cortese, 10 N. J. Super. 152, 76 A. 2d 717 (1950). Other States authorize such tests in bastardy proceedings. See, e. g., Jordan v. Davis, 143 Me. 185, 57 A. 2d 209 (1948); State ex rel. Van Camp v. Welling, 6 Ohio Op. 371, 3 Ohio Supp. 333 (1936). For a general discussion of blood tests in paternity proceedings see Schatkin, Disputed Paternity Proceedings (3d ed. 1953), 193-282.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In explanation, he advised that by regulation the state police are permitted to obtain blood for analysis only when the blood is withdrawn by a physician. He further advised that it is the customary administrative practice among municipalities to allow blood to be taken only by a doctor. In all cases a competent technician is required to make the laboratory analysis incident to the test. We were assured that in no instance had a municipality or the state police permitted the test to be made without these precautions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] National Safety Council, Accident Facts 1956, 43-71.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Governors' Conference Committee, Report on Highway Safety (Nov. 1956); National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, Uniform Vehicle Code (Rev. 1956); White House Conference on Highway Safety, Organize Your Community for Traffic Safety (1954).\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nThe judgment in this case should be reversed if Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165\n, is to retain its vitality and stand as more than an instance of personal revulsion against particular police methods. I cannot agree with the Court when it says, \"we see nothing comparable here to the facts in Rochin.\" It seems to me the essential elements of the cases are the same and the same result should follow.\n\nThere is much in the Court's opinion concerning the hazards on our nation's highways, the efforts of the States to enforce the traffic laws and the necessity for the use of modern scientific methods in the detection of crime. Everybody can agree with these sentiments, and yet they do not help us particularly in determining whether this case can be distinguished from Rochin. That case grew out of police efforts to curb the narcotics traffic, in which there is surely a state interest of at least as great magnitude as the interest in highway law enforcement. Nor does the fact that many States sanction the use of blood test evidence differentiate the cases. At the time Rochin was decided illegally obtained evidence was admissible in the vast majority of States. In both Rochin and this case the officers had probable cause to suspect the defendant of the offense of which they sought evidence. In Rochin the defendant was known as a narcotics law violator, was arrested under suspicious circumstances and was seen by the officers to swallow narcotics. In neither case, of course, are we concerned with the defendant's guilt or innocence. The sole problem is whether the proceeding \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 441]\n\u00a0\n was tainted by a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights.\n\nIn reaching its conclusion that in this case, unlike Rochin, there is nothing \"brutal\" or \"offensive\" the Court has not kept separate the component parts of the problem. Essentially there are two: the character of the invasion of the body and the expression of the victim's will; the latter may be manifested by physical resistance. Of course, one may consent to having his blood extracted or his stomach pumped and thereby waive any due process objection. In that limited sense the expression of the will is significant. But where there is no affirmative consent, I cannot see that it should make any difference whether one states unequivocally that he objects or resorts to physical violence in protest or is in such condition that he is unable to protest. The Court, however, states that \"the absence of conscious consent, without more, does not necessarily render the taking a violation of a constitutional right.\" This implies that a different result might follow if petitioner had been conscious and had voiced his objection. I reject the distinction.\n\nSince there clearly was no consent to the blood test, it is the nature of the invasion of the body that should be determinative of the due process question here presented. The Court's opinion suggests that an invasion is \"brutal\" or \"offensive\" only if the police use force to overcome a suspect's resistance. By its recital of the facts in Rochin - the references to a \"considerable struggle\" and the fact that the stomach pump was \"forcibly used\"\n*\n - the Court finds Rochin distinguishable from this case. I cannot accept an analysis that would make physical resistance by a prisoner a prerequisite to the existence of his constitutional rights. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 442]\n\u00a0\n\n\nApart from the irrelevant factor of physical resistance, the techniques used in this case and in Rochin are comparable. In each the operation was performed by a doctor in a hospital. In each there was an extraction of body fluids. Neither operation normally causes any lasting ill effects. The Court denominates a blood test as a scientific method for detecting crime and cities the frequency of such tests in our everyday life. The stomach pump too is a common and accepted way of making tests and relieving distress. But it does not follow from the fact that a technique is a product of science or is in common, consensual use for other purposes that it can be used to extract evidence from a criminal defendant without his consent. Would the taking of spinal fluid from an unconscious person be condoned because such tests are commonly made and might be used as a scientific aid to law enforcement?\n\nOnly personal reaction to the stomach pump and the blood test can distinguish them. To base the restriction which the Due Process Clause imposes on state criminal procedures upon such reactions is to build on shifting sands. We should, in my opinion, hold that due process means at least that law-enforcement officers in their efforts to obtain evidence from persons suspected of crime must stop short of bruising the body, breaking skin, puncturing tissue or extracting body fluids, whether they contemplate doing it by force or by stealth.\n\nViewed according to this standard, the judgment should be reversed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Actually, the struggle in Rochin occurred in the defendant's home after the officers had broken in. He was arrested and taken to a hospital, and there was no evidence that he struggled there.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, dissenting.\n\nThe Court seems to sanction in the name of law enforcement the assault made by the police on this unconscious man. If law enforcement were the chief value in our constitutional scheme, then due process would shrivel \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 443]\n\u00a0\n and become of little value in protecting the rights of the citizen. But those who fashioned the Constitution put certain rights out of the reach of the police and preferred other rights over law enforcement.\n\nOne source of protection of the citizen against state action is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Our decisions hold that the police violate due process when they use brutal methods to obtain evidence against a man and use it to convict him. Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165\n; Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n. But the conception of due process is not limited to a prohibition of the use of force and violence against an accused. In Leyra v. Denno, \n347 \nU.S. 556\n, we set aside a conviction where subtle, nonviolent methods had been used to exact a confession from a prisoner. For it was obvious that coercion might be the product of subtlety as well as of violence. We should take the same libertarian approach here.\n\nAs I understand today's decision there would be a violation of due process if the blood had been withdrawn from the accused after a struggle with the police. But the sanctity of the person is equally violated and his body assaulted where the prisoner is incapable of offering resistance as it would be if force were used to overcome his resistance. In both cases evidence is used to convict a man which has been obtained from him on an involuntary basis. I would not draw a line between the use of force on the one hand and trickery, subterfuge, or any police technique which takes advantage of the inability of the prisoner to resist on the other. Nor would I draw a line between involuntary extraction of words from his lips, the involuntary extraction of the contents of his stomach, and the involuntary extraction of fluids of his body when the evidence obtained is used to convict him. Under our system of government, police cannot compel people to furnish the evidence necessary to send them to prison. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 444]\n\u00a0\n Yet there is compulsion here, following the violation by the police of the sanctity of the body of an unconscious man.\n\nAnd if the decencies of a civilized state are the test, it is repulsive to me for the police to insert needles into an unconscious person in order to get the evidence necessary to convict him, whether they find the person unconscious, give him a pill which puts him to sleep, or use force to subdue him. The indignity to the individual is the same in one case as in the other, for in each is his body invaded and assaulted by the police who are supposed to be the citizen's protector.\n\nI would reverse this judgment of conviction. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 432, 445]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRITISH TRANSPORT COMM'N v. U.S.(1957)\nNo. 247\nArgued: April 29, 1957Decided: June 10, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Under the Limited Liability Act, 46 U.S.C. 181-196, the United States filed a proceeding in a Federal District Court for exoneration from, or limitation of liability for, loss or damage resulting from a collision in the North Sea between one of its ships and a ship owned by the British Transport Commission. The Commission and others filed claims in the proceeding. While the proceeding was pending, some of the claimants against the American ship filed cross-claims against the British ship, and the United States asserted a \"set-off\" and a \"cross-claim\" against the British ship in answer to the latter's claim. Held: the claimants against the British ship may implead the Commission to respond to any damages for losses suffered by them in the collision, and the court having jurisdiction of the limitation proceeding may proceed to settle all questions appropriate to, and seasonably raised in, that proceeding by parties thereto. Pp. 130-143.\n\n (a) Whether it be by analogy to Admiralty Rule 56 or by virtue of Admiralty Rule 44, or by admiralty's general rules heretofore promulgated by this Court, it is a necessary concomitant of jurisdiction in a factual situation such as this that the court have power to adjudicate all of the demands made and arising out of the same disaster. Pp. 135-139.\n\n\n (b) Fairness in litigation requires that those who seek affirmative recovery in a court should be subject therein to like exposure for the damage resulting from their acts connected with the identical incident. Pp. 141-143.\n\n\n (c) In the final analysis, the manifest advantages of this cross-claim procedure serve the best interests of all the parties before a court of the United States who find themselves the unfortunate victims of maritime disaster. P. 143.\n\n\n 230 F.2d 139, affirmed.\n\nDean Acheson argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Edwin Longcope and Charles A. Horsky. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 130]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAssistant Attorney General Doub argued the cause for the United States, respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Samuel D. Slade and William W. Ross.\n\nWilbur E. Dow, Jr. argued the cause for Haslam et al., respondents. With him on the brief were John W. Oast, Jr. and C. Lydon Harrell, Jr.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe British Transport Commission, owner of the overnight ferry, Duke of York, questions the power of a District Court sitting in an admiralty limitation proceeding to permit the parties to cross-claim against each other for damages arising out of the same maritime collision. The United States, as owner of the U.S. N. S. Haiti Victory, had filed the original proceeding in which the Commission along with others filed claims. While the proceeding was pending some of the claimants against the Haiti filed cross-claims against the Duke and, in addition, the United States asserted a \"set-off\" and \"cross-claim\" against the Duke in answer to the latter's claim. The District Court dismissed all of the cross-claims on the ground that \"a limitation proceeding does not provide a forum for the adjudication of liability of co-claimants to each other.\" The Court of Appeals reversed holding that \"As a practical matter as well as an equitable one, the claimants herein should be allowed to implead the Commission.\" 230 F.2d 139, 144. Because the question is an important one of admiralty jurisdiction we granted certiorari, limited to the limitation proceeding question. \n352 \nU.S. 821\n. We agree with the Court of Appeals.\n\nOn May 6, 1953, in the North Sea, the Naval Transport, Haiti Victory, owned by the United States, rammed the overnight channel ferry, Duke of York, owned by \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 131]\n\u00a0\n petitioner. The bow of the Duke broke away from the vessel and sank as a result of a deep cut on her port side just forward of the bridge inflicted by the Haiti. While the Haiti suffered only minor damage the Duke's loss was claimed to be $1,500,000. In addition several of the 437 persons aboard the Duke were killed, many were injured, and many of them lost their baggage. The Haiti returned to the United States and, thereafter, this proceeding was filed under 183-186 of the Limited Liability Act, R. S. 4281-4289, as amended, 46 U.S.C. 181-196, for exoneration from, or limitation of, liability for loss or damage resulting from the collision. The United States as petitioner further alleged that the collision was \"caused by the fault and neglect of the SS Duke of York and the persons in charge of her . . . and occurred without fault on the part of the petitioner . . . .\"\n\nThe Duke filed a claim in the proceeding for $1,500,000 and in addition an answer in which it claimed, inter alia, that the damages resulting from the collision were \"not caused or contributed to by any fault or negligence on the part of this claimant . . . but were done, occasioned or incurred with the privity or knowledge of and were caused by the Petitioner and its managing officers and supervising agents and the master of the Haiti Victory . . . which will be shown on the trial.\" The United States answered that the collision \"was occasioned by either the sole fault of the Duke of York or the joint fault of both the Duke of York and the Haiti Victory\"; it alleged damage to the Haiti in the sum of $65,000, and that in addition it \"has also been subjected to claims by passengers and members of the crews of both vessels filed herein, which presently approximate $809,714 for personal injury and death, and $45,975 for property damage other than that claimed by the Duke of York; all of which damage it prays to set off and recoup against the claimant, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 132]\n\u00a0\n British Transport Commission, as owner of the Duke of York . . . .\" Various of the claimants against the Haiti in the meanwhile filed impleading petitions against the Duke alleging the collision was \"caused or contributed to by the fault and negligence of the S. S. `Duke of York' . . .\" setting out, as did the United States, the particular acts upon which the claim of negligence was based. The District Court dismissed all of these cross-claims holding that the Act offers \"a forum for the complete adjudication and recovery of all claims . . . against the petitioner only. . . . To permit one claimant to prosecute another claimant in the limitation litigation would be unfair. The latter has intervened under compulsion, the court enjoining his resort to any other tribunal. Therefore, his responsibility should not be enlarged beyond that incident to his claim. Obedience to the injunction should not expose him to an attack to which, in regular course, he would be subject only in the jurisdiction of his residence or other place of voluntary entrance.\"\n\nOn a hearing \"restricted to the issues of the asserted liabilities of the two vessels, Duke of York and Haiti Victory, for the collision,\" the court exonerated the Haiti from all liability, holding the Duke solely to blame for the collision. 131 F. Supp. 712. This finding was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeals and is not before us.\n1\n In reversing the dismissal of the cross-claims \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Appeals reasoned that \"Modern codes of procedure have reflected two facets: (1) all rights, if this can fairly be done, should be decided in a single legal proceeding; (2) parties who submit themselves to the jurisdiction of a court in a legal proceeding should be bound by that court's decision on all questions, appropriate to and seasonably raised in, that proceeding. Those ideas, we think, can reasonably be deduced from the spirit, if not the letter, of the 56th Admiralty Rule.\" 230 F.2d, at 145.\n\nThe excellent coverage this Court's cases have given the historical incidents forming the background that went into the adoption of the Limited Liability Act relieves us of any minute recitation of that history. See Norwich Co. v. Wright, 13 Wall. 104 (1872); Providence & N. Y. S. S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., \n109 \nU.S. 578\n (1883); The Main v. Williams, \n152 \nU.S. 122\n (1894); Just v. Chambers, \n312 \nU.S. 383\n (1941). The history shows that although the Act was patterned on earlier English statutes its foundations sprang from the roots of the general maritime law of medieval Europe. \"The real object of the act . . . was to limit the liability of vessel owners to their interest in the adventure,\" The Main v. Williams, supra, at 131, and thus \"to encourage ship-building and to induce capitalists to invest money in this branch of industry,\" Norwich Co. v. Wright, supra, at 121.\n\nThe Congress by the provisions of the Act left the form and modes of procedure to the judiciary. Twenty years after passage of the Act this Court adopted some general rules with respect to admiralty practice. See 13 Wall. xii and xiii. Rule 56 first came into the General Admiralty Rules as Rule 59.\n2\n As will be noted, it was originally \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n fashioned to accommodate cross-libels in marine collision cases, but acting upon the same inherent power to bring into the proceeding other parties whose presence would enable the court to do substantial justice in regard to the entire matter, the courts soon began to extend the practice by analogy to cases other than collision. See, e. g., The Alert, 40 F. 836 (1889); 3 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948). 450-456. As it is expressed in 2 Benedict, Admiralty (6th ed. 1940), 349, at 534, \"the `equity of the rule' was given wide extension and the principle . . . was applied by analogy to require the appearance of any additional respondent who might be responsible for the claim or a part thereof.\" In the 1920 revision the 59th Rule became the 56th General Admiralty Rule and, as amended by this Court, authorized either a claimant or respondent to bring in any other vessel or person \"partly or wholly liable . . . by way of remedy over, contribution or otherwise, growing out of the same matter.\" \n254 \nU.S. 707\n.\n3\n The present-day limitation proceeding, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n therefore, springs from the 1851 Act and this Court's rules. Neither source indicates that admiralty limitation precluded other ordinary admiralty procedures. In fact, as Mr. Justice Bradley put it in The Scotland, \n105 \nU.S. 24, 33\n (1881), \"we may say, once for all, that [the rules] were not intended to restrict parties claiming the benefit of the law, but to aid them. . . . The rules referred to were adopted for the purpose of formulating a proceeding that would give full protection to the ship-owners in such a case. They were not intended to prevent them from availing themselves of any other remedy or process which the law itself might entitle them to adopt.\" Accord, Ex parte Slayton, \n105 \nU.S. 451\n (1882).\n\nIt is the Commission's contention that Rule 56 is wholly inapplicable to the adjudication of a claim of one coclaimant against another in a limitation proceeding. The rule, it says, refers to libels and the use of the word \"claimant\" includes only the claimant of the vessel involved \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 136]\n\u00a0\n and not to those making claims against the vessel. But we have seen that Rule 56 has long been held to encompass cross-claims between parties in libel actions. This Court has held that limitation of liability petitions may also be determined by appropriate pleading in libel actions. See The North Star, \n106 \nU.S. 17\n (1882), and the discussion infra. It may therefore be said that a limitation proceeding not only provides concourse but serves the function of a cross-libel to determine the rights between petitioner and claimants as well; and equitable rights between the limitation petitioner and a claimant have long been recognized as encompassed in Rule 50.\n4\n Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. McMahon, 235 F.2d 142 (1956). It appears then that had this proceeding started out as a libel the Commission admittedly would have no complaint. And as we have pointed out, the Rules were not promulgated as technicalities restricting the parties as well as the admiralty court in the adjudication of relevant issues before it. There should therefore be no requirement that the facts of a case be tailored to fit the exact language of a rule. The initial petition filed in the limitation proceeding alleged that the Duke was wholly or partly at fault and asked for a \"set-off\" or \"cross-claim\" against it; the Commission entered the case not only to prove its claim but to contest this allegation of negligence against the Duke. The claimants are all \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 137]\n\u00a0\n present in the litigation. The United States has now filed a cross-claim or cross-libel against the Commission, it already being a party to the suit and before the court. The question is not what \"tag\" we put on the proceeding, or whether it is a \"suit\" under Rule 56 or a libel in personam, or whether the pleading is of an offensive or defensive nature, but rather whether the Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties. It is sufficient to say as did Chief Justice Taft for a unanimous Court in Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n273 \nU.S. 207\n (1927), \"that all the ease with which rights can be adjusted in equity is intended to be given to the [limitation] proceeding. It is the administration of equity in an admiralty court. . . . It looks to a complete and just disposition of a many cornered controversy . . . .\" Id., at 216. See also the opinion of Chief Justice Hughes for a unanimous Court in Just v. Chambers, \n312 \nU.S. 383, 386\n-387 (1941). We do not believe that the analogy to equity is shadowy. The claimants in this proceeding have just claims arising out of the collision of the Haiti and the Duke. They have as much interest in the potential liability resulting from that marine disaster as has the equity receiver in perfecting the res of the estate. The scope of the proceeding is not limited to a determination of the petitioner's fault nor to its interest in the Haiti. In fact, here the fault of the disaster, a matter of legitimate interest to the claimants, has been adjudicated against the Commission and it admits this judgment is res judicata in all courts. Why does it not follow that the claimants, scattered as they are in eight countries of the world but all present in this proceeding, should recover judgment for their damages? Why should each be required to file a secondary action in the courts of another country merely to prove the amount of his due when the same evidence is already before the admiralty court here? \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 138]\n\u00a0\n\n\nLogic and efficient judicial administration require that recovery against all parties at fault is as necessary to the claimants as is the fund which limited the liability of the initial petitioner. Otherwise this proceeding is but a \"water haul\" for the claimants, a result completely out of character in admiralty practice. Furthermore, the Commission entered this proceeding voluntarily without compulsion. It filed an answer asking that justice be done regarding the subject matter, the collision; it denied all fault on its part and affirmatively sought to place all blame on the Haiti; it claimed damage in the sum of $1,500,000; and it contested the Haiti's claim of limitation or exoneration. In all of these respects judgment went against the Commission - it lost. Now having lost, it claims that the court has wholly lost jurisdiction while had it won, jurisdiction to enter judgment on all claims would have continued. It asserts that neither the Haiti, which was damaged to the extent of some $65,000, nor any of the other 115 claimants may prove their losses against it. But reason compels the conclusion that if the court had power to administer justice in the event the Commission had won, it should have like power when it lost. Whether it is by analogy to Rule 56 or by virtue of Rule 44,\n5\n or by admiralty's general rules heretofore promulgated by this Court, we hold it a necessary concomitant of jurisdiction in a factual situation such as this one that the Court have power to adjudicate all of the demands made and arising out of the same disaster. This too reflects the basic policy of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 139]\n\u00a0\n Admiralty practice, which has served as the origin of much of our modern federal procedure, should not be tied to the mast of legal technicalities it has been the forerunner in eliminating from other federal practices.\n\nIt is true that no case of this Court has passed on the question directly. However, examination of the practice of American admiralty courts indicates that cross-libel procedures have been resorted to between co-parties in a limitation concursus at least since The North Star, \n106 \nU.S. 17\n (1882). While initially that case was not a limitation proceeding, this Court held that both parties could have obtained a limitation of liability if entitled to it without the necessity of separate suits. In The Manitoba, \n122 \nU.S. 97\n (1887), both the libelant and the cross-libelant sought and received the benefit of liability limitation. Thereafter, in The City of Boston, 182 F. 171 (1909), a District Court allowed the filing of cross claims in the limitation proceeding there begun. It is of interest to note that while there was no express rule at the time permitting such procedure it was granted \"following the analogy of admiralty rule 59 [now Rule 56].\" It was thought that \"the same claim for contribution which . . . might [be recovered] in an independent suit\" could properly be adjudicated by a cross-claim although there was no \"reported precedent for the allowance of such a claim in limited liability proceedings.\" In re Eastern Dredging Co., 182 F. 179, 183 (1909). In 1919 the Second Circuit decided The Adah, 258 F. 377, in which Judge Hough declared that \"Whether it was necessary, in absolving the Adah, to fix blame on some one else, is a question we need not decide.\" But where the parties enter the limitation proceeding, the court held \"It is enough that they did come in, and made parties of themselves. . . . Having become parties, they are bound by the decree entered in the suit wherein they are parties.\" Id., at 381. And this was but the echo of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 140]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Bradley in The Scotland, supra, where he said, \"when parties choose to resort to [a nation's] forum for redress\" they cannot \"complain of the determination of their rights by that law . . . .\" \n105 \nU.S., at 31\n-32. Later in In re United States Steel Products Co., 24 F.2d 657 (1928), the Second Circuit squarely decided that cross-claims were properly considered in limitation proceedings. The United States' claim in limitation was \"a right of suit in admiralty against the Steel Inventor,\" id., at 659, the court said, which subjected it to cross-suit, citing United States v. The Thekla, \n266 \nU.S. 328\n (1924). See also The Steel Inventor, 43 F.2d 958 (1930). And as recently as Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. McMahon, 235 F.2d 142 (1956), the Second Circuit unanimously reaffirmed the principles of these cases. It reasoned that since all of the claims arose out of the same incident they should be determined in a single cause, thus effectuating an \"economy of trial litigation\" so much desired in judicial administration.\n\nPetitioner points to cases from the Second Circuit in which cross-claims were not permitted.\n6\n But we find none apposite to this case, other than perhaps New Jersey Barging Corp. v. T. A. D. Jones & Co., 135 F. Supp. 97 (1955). That case held that the impleading of the claimant would convert a proceeding to limit the petitioners' liability to a proceeding by other claimants against the impleaded claimant. While it is sufficient to say that New Jersey Barging Corp. has subsequently, in effect, been overruled by the Second Circuit in Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. McMahon, supra, we might add that it is easily distinguishable from the situation here. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 141]\n\u00a0\n No answer was filed and no effort was made toward an affirmative defense, the claimant only having forwarded his statement of asserted damage by mail. Nor do we think Algoma C. & H. B. R. Co. v. Great Lakes Transit Corp., 86 F.2d 708 (1936), affords petitioner comfort. There Judge Learned Hand held that the railroad, in filing a limitation proceeding, had improperly laid venue. While there is some dicta in the opinion indicating that the petitioner in a limitation proceeding could recover nothing affirmatively, we agree with Judge Knox's interpretation of that case in his opinion in The Clio - The Springhill, 1948 A. M. C. 75, 77. In Algoma the original limitation petitioner had filed no counterclaim in its proceeding. Therefore nothing could be recovered affirmatively. The case therefore does not stand for the proposition that it would not be permissible for a counterclaim to be filed. The view that the counterclaim would be permissible is supported by The Steel Inventor, supra, and In re United States Steel Products Co., supra, in both of which Judge Hand participated.\n\nPetitioner also depends heavily on Department of Highways v. Jahncke Service, Inc., 174 F.2d 894 (1949), an opinion of the Fifth Circuit. We believe it inapposite also. There Jahncke's barges tore loose in a windstorm and damaged the Department of Highways' bridge. Jahncke petitioned for limitation and the Department, after filing its claim and answer, then attempted to implead the Town of Madisonville, the owner of some other barges, which also had struck the bridge. Obviously there was no connection, other than the same wind and water, between Madisonville's barges which were independently moored and Jahncke's. Madisonville had filed no claim in Jahncke's limitation proceeding, the damages arising from a distinctly separate incident.\n\nPetitioner points to the many dire consequences that may flow from exposing claimants to cross-claims. While \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 142]\n\u00a0\n these predictions are entirely speculative and not before us, we comment on those which petitioner believes to be the more serious. First it says foreign claimants will be frightened away and will not file claims in American limitation proceedings. This result is more, says petitioner, \"than just robbing Peter to pay Paul.\" But if petitioner prevailed both Peter and Paul would be robbed. While it is true that no compulsion could be exerted on foreign claimants to file claims and some would not do so thus preventing the determination of fault from being res judicata as to them; and while an injunction against suits being filed in foreign jurisdictions would be ineffective unless comity required its recognition; and assuming all this would encourage the filing of foreign suits and the levying of attachments on any offending American vessel while in a foreign port, or for that matter against any vessel of the same American owner; still this would have little practical effect on the operation of our limitation law. Most foreign claimants are foreign shipowners whose vessels visit American ports and are subject to like action by claimants living here. Self-protection would balance things out. But even if it did not, of what good is a judgment as to fault, even if res judicata, if a claimant recovers nothing? The proceeding here would become entirely abortive. Petitioner's theory makes the claimants no more than pawns in a game between the offending shipowners in which all that the claimants win after the successful battle is the right to fight another day for their due and in another court. It appears to us, therefore, that fairness in litigation requires that those who seek affirmative recovery in a court should be subject therein to like exposure for the damage resulting from their acts connected with the identical incident. The claimants here ask no more. That no foreign country permits such impleading should not force litigants in United States courts to forego such procedures. Foreign \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 143]\n\u00a0\n limitation of liability procedures are for the most part different from ours where not only fault but claims are determined as part and parcel of the limitation action itself. We conclude that in the final analysis the manifest advantages of this cross-claim procedure serve the best interests of all of the parties before a court of the United States who find themselves the unfortunate victims of maritime disaster.\n\nOther questions of procedural detail raised by the petitioner we leave to the trial courts. This has been the policy of this Court in the past in admiralty practice.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The United States had not filed a cross-claim against the Duke for damage to its vessel because, as it alleges, its counsel felt that it had waived recovery of any claim against a vessel of the British Government by virtue of the \"Knock for Knock\" Agreement, 56 Stat. 1780, E. A. S. 282, Dec. 4, 1942. Subsequently, while the appeal was pending, the British Government advised that it did not consider the Duke as a government vessel. Consequently, following the Court of Appeals decision, the United States filed a cross-claim against the Duke in the proceedings before the District Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Rule 56 was adopted as Rule 59 in 1883 as a codification of the decision in The Hudson, 15 F. 162 (1883). The Rule then provided in part: \"In a suit for damage by collision, if the claimant of any vessel \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n proceeded against, or any respondent proceeded against in personam, shall, by petition, on oath, presented before or at the time of answering the libel, or within such further time as the court may allow, and containing suitable allegations showing fault or negligence in any other vessel contributing to the same collision, and the particulars thereof, and that such other vessel or any other party ought to be proceeded against in the same suit for such damage, pray that process be issued against such vessel or party to that end, such process may be issued . . . .\" \n112 \nU.S. 743\n. The remainder of Rule 59 in its original form is substantially similar to the last two sentences of the present Rule 56.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The present Rule 56 provides: \"In any suit, whether in rem or in personam, the claimant or respondent (as the case may be) shall be entitled to bring in any other vessel or person (individual or corporation) who may be partly or wholly liable either to the libellant or to such claimant or respondent by way of remedy over, contribution or otherwise, growing out of the same matter. This shall be done by petition, on oath, presented before or at the time of answering the libel, or at any later time \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n during the progress of the cause that the court may allow. Such petition shall contain suitable allegations showing such liability, and the particulars thereof, and that such other vessel or person ought to be proceeded against in the same suit for such damage, and shall pray that process be issued against such vessel or person to that end. Thereupon such process shall issue, and if duly served, such suit shall proceed as if such vessel or person had been originally proceeded against; the other parties in the suit shall answer the petition; the claimant of such vessel or such new party shall answer the libel; and such further proceedings shall be had and decree rendered by the court in the suit as to law and justice shall appertain. But every such petitioner shall, upon filing his petition, give a stipulation, with sufficient sureties, or an approved corporate surety, to pay the libellant and to any claimant or any new party brought in by virtue of such process, all such costs, damages, and expenses as shall be awarded against the petitioner by the court on the final decree, whether rendered in the original or appellate court; and any such claimant or new party shall give the same bonds or stipulations which are required in the like cases from parties brought in under process issued on the prayer of a libellant.\" \n254 \nU.S. 707\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Rule 50 provides: \"Whenever a cross-libel is filed upon any counterclaim arising out of the same contract or cause of action for which the original libel was filed, and the respondent or claimant in the original suit shall have given security to respond in damages, the respondent in the cross-libel shall give security in the usual amount and form to respond in damages to the claims set forth in said cross-libel, unless the court, for cause shown, shall otherwise direct; and all proceedings on the original libel shall be stayed until such security be given unless the court otherwise directs.\" \n254 \nU.S. 702\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Rule 44 provides: \"In suits in admiralty in all cases not provided for by these rules or by statute, the district courts are to regulate their practice in such a manner as they deem most expedient for the due administration of justice, provided the same are not inconsistent with these rules.\" \n254 \nU.S. 698\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Algoma C. & H.

JUSTICE HARLAN join, announced by MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.\n\nIn terms, Admiralty Rule 56 authorizes cross-claim practice only in libel proceedings. The instant proceeding, however, is not a libel, but a limitation proceeding. I do not pause to examine the arguments marshalled by the Court in favor of cross-claim practice in limitation proceedings, for, in my opinion, if such practice is desirable, it should be introduced by amending the Admiralty Rules, and not by a decision in a particular litigation which was commenced by the original litigants without knowledge on their part or the Admiralty Bar that such a practice obtained in limitation proceedings.\n\nIt is inequitable, in the circumstances of this case, to apply to the British Commission a practice first announced today. The contracts of passage between the Commission and its co-claimants were not entered into under American law. The Duke of York was a passenger ferry operating on a fixed schedule between the Hook of Holland and Harwich, England. The 437 passengers aboard at the time of the collision held tickets for transportation \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 144]\n\u00a0\n across the North Sea from a railroad station in Holland to a railroad station in Harwich. Those tickets were contracts of passage containing provisions for exoneration from liability more favorable than are allowed by American law. There is no challenge to the statement in a footnote to the Commission's brief that\n\n \"Under English law the amount at which liability may be limited is far lower than in the United States, generally 15 per ton of tonnage. Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 60) Sec. 503. Furthermore, the English rules of liability are substantially different from those applied in our courts. A carrier under English law may by appropriate contract and notice limit its liability for negligence, and periods of limitation for the assertion of damage or loss are different. See Collision Claims - Difference Between British and U.S. Law, Lloyds List and Shipping Gazette, July 14, 1953.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n And see Adler v. Dickson, 1954. 2 Lloyd's List L. R. 267 (C. A.). There is at least a substantial prospect that in the American courts these more favorable English rules of liability may not be fully recognized and applied. Congress has said that provisions or limitations exonerating a shipowner from liability for negligence or from liability beyond a stipulated amount are against the public policy of the United States, and shall be null and void and of no effect. See, e. g., R. S. 4283, as amended, 49 Stat. 1480, 46 U.S.C. 183 (c); Note, 65 Yale L. J. 553; Moore v. American Scantic Line, 30 F. Supp. 843.\n\nThe British Commission could not have been compelled to enter the limitation proceeding, but did so voluntarily. We may reasonably infer that its decision to participate was based upon its understanding of the issues it would be called upon to face. The notice of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 145]\n\u00a0\n those issues gave not the slightest hint that the Commission would be required to answer to other claimants who might enter the proceedings. The notice was:\n\n \"Notice is given that the United States of America has filed a petition pursuant to Title 46, U.S. Code, sections 183-189 and 789, claiming the right to exoneration from or limitation of liability for all claims arising on the voyage of the USNS HAITI VICTORY from New York City to Bremerhaven, Germany, terminating on May 8, 1953, at Bremerhaven. All persons having such claims must file them, under oath, as provided in United States Supreme Court Admiralty Rule 52, with the Clerk of this Court, at the United States Court House at Granby Street, Post Office Building, Norfolk, Virginia, and serve on or mail to the petitioner's proctors . . . at . . . a copy on or before October 15, 1953, or be defaulted. Personal attendance is not required. Any claimant desiring to contest the claims of petitioner must file an answer to said petition, as required by Supreme Court Admiralty Rule 53, and serve on or mail to petitioner's proctors a copy.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Plainly this notice told the Commission only that if it chose to enter this proceeding it must be prepared to contest the claims of the United States to exoneration from or limitation of liability for claims arising out of the collision. That issue did not in anywise draw in the Commission's defenses against claims of the Duke of York's passengers. The Commission therefore had no information to alert it that it might hazard its defenses under its contracts of passage if it entered the proceeding. The Commission thus had no fair opportunity to weigh that factor in reaching the very practical decision whether to enter the American proceeding or to stay out and meet \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 146]\n\u00a0\n all claimants on its home grounds. It is a fundamental of American justice that a litigant shall have fair notice of what he will be called upon to meet. In holding that, although the Commission was not given such notice, it must litigate the cross-claims here, the Court, in my view, denies equity in the name of equity.\n\nI would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and direct affirmance of the decree of the District Court. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 129, 147]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUTLER v.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis appeal from a judgment of conviction entered by the Recorder's Court of the City of Detroit, Michigan, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 380, 381]\n\u00a0\n challenges the constitutionality of the following provision, 343, of the Michigan Penal Code:\n\n \"Any person who shall import, print, publish, sell, possess with the intent to sell, design, prepare, loan, give away, distribute or offer for sale, any book, magazine, newspaper, writing, pamphlet, ballad, printed paper, print, picture, drawing, photograph, publication or other thing, including any recordings, containing obscene, immoral, lewd or lascivious language, or obscene, immoral, lewd or lascivious prints, pictures, figures or descriptions, tending to incite minors to violent or depraved or immoral acts, manifestly tending to the corruption of the morals of youth, or shall introduce into any family, school or place of education or shall buy, procure, receive or have in his possession, any such book, pamphlet, magazine, newspaper, writing, ballad, printed paper, print, picture, drawing, photograph, publication or other thing, either for the purpose of sale, exhibition, loan or circulation, or with intent to introduce the same into any family, school or place of education, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\"\n\n\n Appellant was charged with its violation for selling to a police officer what the trial judge characterized as \"a book containing obscene, immoral, lewd, lascivious language, or descriptions, tending to incite minors to violent or depraved or immoral acts, manifestly tending to the corruption of the morals of youth.\" Appellant moved to dismiss the proceeding on the claim that application of 343 unduly restricted freedom of speech as protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that the statute (1) prohibited distribution of a book to the general public on the basis of the undesirable influence it may have upon youth; (2) damned a book and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 380, 382]\n\u00a0\n proscribed its sale merely because of some isolated passages that appeared objectionable when divorced from the book as a whole; and (3) failed to provide a sufficiently definite standard of guilt. After hearing the evidence, the trial judge denied the motion, and, in an oral opinion, held that \". . . the defendant is guilty because he sold a book in the City of Detroit containing this language [the passages deemed offensive], and also because the Court feels that even viewing the book as a whole, it [the objectionable language] was not necessary to the proper development of the theme of the book nor of the conflict expressed therein.\" Appellant was fined $100.\n\nPressing his federal claims, appellant applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Michigan. Although the State consented to the granting of the application \"because the issues involved in this case are of great public interest, and because it appears that further clarification of the language of . . . [the statute] is necessary,\" leave to appeal was denied. In view of this denial, the appeal is here from the Recorder's Court of Detroit. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n350 \nU.S. 963\n.\n\nAppellant's argument here took a wide sweep. We need not follow him. Thus, it is unnecessary to dissect the remarks of the trial judge in order to determine whether he construed 343 to ban the distribution of books merely because certain of their passages, when viewed in isolation, were deemed objectionable. Likewise, we are free to put aside the claim that the Michigan law falls within the doctrine whereby a New York obscenity statute was found invalid in Winters v. New York, \n333 \nU.S. 507\n.\n\nIt is clear on the record that appellant was convicted because Michigan, by 343, made it an offense for him to make available for the general reading public (and he in fact sold to a police officer) a book that the trial judge \n\n[352 \nU.S. 380, 383]\n\u00a0\n found to have a potentially deleterious influence upon youth. The State insists that, by thus quarantining the general reading public against books not too rugged for grown men and women in order to shield juvenile innocence, it is exercising its power to promote the general welfare. Surely, this is to burn the house to roast the pig. Indeed, the Solicitor General of Michigan has, with characteristic candor, advised the Court that Michigan has a statute specifically designed to protect its children against obscene matter \"tending to the corruption of the morals of youth.\"\n*\n But the appellant was not convicted for violating this statute.\n\nWe have before us legislation not reasonably restricted to the evil with which it is said to deal. The incidence of this enactment is to reduce the adult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit for children. It thereby \n\n[352 \nU.S. 380, 384]\n\u00a0\n arbitrarily curtails one of those liberties of the individual, now enshrined in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, that history has attested as the indispensable conditions for the maintenance and progress of a free society.

JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented here is whether the Railway Labor Act of May 20, 1926, 44 Stat. 577, as amended. 45 U.S.C. 151 et seq., applies to the State Belt Railroad, a common carrier owned and operated by the State of California and engaged in interstate commerce. For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that it does.\n\nThe operations of the State Belt Railroad have been described by this Court in Sherman v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 25\n; United States v. California, \n297 \nU.S. 175\n; and California v. Latimer, \n305 \nU.S. 255\n. It parallels the San Francisco waterfront, serves wharves and industrial plants, and connects with car ferries, steamship docks and three interstate railroads. It is a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce and files tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\nFor over 65 years, the Belt Railroad has been owned by the State of California. It is operated by the Board of State Harbor Commissioners for San Francisco Harbor, composed of three Commissioners appointed by the Governor. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 555]\n\u00a0\n Its employees number from 125 to 255 and are appointed in accordance with the civil service laws of the State. These laws prescribe procedures for hirings, promotions, layoffs and dismissals, and authorize the State Personnel Board to fix rates of pay and overtime.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nOn September 1, 1942, the Board of State Harbor Commissioners entered into a collective-bargaining agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen as the representatives of the Belt Railroad's operating employees. This agreement established procedures for promotions, layoffs and dismissals. It also fixed rates of pay and overtime. Those procedures and rates differed from their counterparts under the state civil service laws.\n\nThe collective-bargaining agreement conformed to the Railway Labor Act and was observed by the parties at least until January 1948. At that time, a successor Harbor Board instituted litigation in the state courts of California in which it contended that the Railway Labor Act had no application to the Belt Railroad, and that the wages and working conditions of the Railroad's employees were governed by the State's civil service laws rather than by the agreement. This contention was rejected by a local trial court and by the California District Court of Appeal. State v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, 222 P.2d 27. It was, however, accepted by the Supreme Court of California, with one justice dissenting, 37 Cal. 2d 412, 422, 232 P.2d 857, 864, certiorari denied, \n342 \nU.S. 876\n.\n\nShortly thereafter, five employees of the Belt Railroad instituted the present action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 556]\n\u00a0\n the ten members of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, First Division, and its executive secretary. The employees alleged that they had filed with the First Division, pursuant to 3, First (i), of the Railway Labor Act, claims relating to their classifications, extra pay and seniority rights under the agreement. They charged that the five carrier members of the Division had refused to consider these claims on the ground that the Board was without jurisdiction, because, under the above decision of the Supreme Court of California, the Belt Railroad was not subject to the Railway Labor Act. The employees alleged that this refusal created an impasse in the ten-member Division and they sought a court order requiring action on their claims. The United States, answering on behalf of the First Division and its executive secretary, supported the complaint and prayer for relief. The carrier members, answering through their own attorneys, opposed the complaint, as did the present petitioner, the State of California, which intervened as a party defendant.\n\nThe District Court granted California's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. 132 F. Supp. 356. The Court of Appeals reversed. 233 F.2d 251. It held that the Railway Labor Act applied to the Belt Railroad, and remanded the cause to the District Court with directions to enter a decree granting the relief sought. We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict between the United States Court of Appeals and the California Supreme Court as to the applicability of the Railway Labor Act to a railroad owned and operated by a State. \n352 \nU.S. 940\n.\n2\n We invited the Solicitor \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 557]\n\u00a0\n General to file a brief as amicus curiae and in doing so, he urged that the Railway Labor Act was applicable to the State Belt Railroad.\n\nThe Railway Labor Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 577, evolved from legislative experimentation beginning in 1888.\n3\n The evolution of this railroad labor code was marked by a continuing attempt to bring about self-adjustment of disputes between rail carriers and their employees. To this end, specialized machinery of mediation and arbitration was established. The 1926 Act - unique in that it had been agreed upon by the majority of the railroads and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 558]\n\u00a0\n their employees\n4\n - incorporated practically every device previously used in settling disputes between carriers and their employees. These included (1) conferences between the parties; (2) appeal to a Board of Adjustment; (3) recourse to the permanent Board of Mediation; (4) submission of the controversy to a temporary Board of Arbitration; and (5) the establishment of an Emergency Board of Investigation appointed by the President.\n\nDissatisfaction with the operation of this legislation led to its 1934 amendments. 48 Stat. 1185.\n5\n One of the most significant changes was the creation of the National Railroad Adjustment Board composed of equal numbers of carrier representatives and representatives of unions national in scope. The Board was divided into four divisions, each with jurisdiction over particular crafts or classes and their disputes. 3. This arrangement made available a National Board to settle disputes in case the carrier and its employees could not agree upon a system, group or regional board. The National Board was given jurisdiction over \"minor disputes,\" meaning those involving the interpretation of collective-bargaining agreements in a particular set of facts. Either party to such a dispute could bring the other before the Board in what \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 559]\n\u00a0\n was, in fact, compulsory arbitration. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River & I. R. Co., \n353 \nU.S. 30\n. Provisions were made for the enforcement of a Board order against a carrier in a United States District Court. 3, First (p).\n\nSection 2, Fourth, of the 1934 amendments insured to railroad employees the right to organize their own unions and the right of a majority of any craft or class of employees to select the representative of that craft or class. Section 2, Ninth, authorized the newly created National Mediation Board to hold representation elections and to certify the representative with which the carrier must deal. Section 2, Fourth, provided that the employees shall have the right to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. On numerous occasions, this Court has recognized that the Railway Labor Act protects and promotes collective bargaining. Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 548\n-549, 553; Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297, 300\n, 302; Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., \n321 \nU.S. 342, 346\n-347; Steele v. Louisville & N. R. Co., \n323 \nU.S. 192, 202\n; Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, \n351 \nU.S. 225, 233\n, 235.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nIf the Railway Labor Act applies to the Belt Railroad, then the carrier's employees can invoke its machinery established for adjustment of labor controversies, and the National Railway Adjustment Board has jurisdiction over respondents' claims. Moreover, the Act's policy of protecting collective bargaining comes into conflict with the rule of California law that state employees have no right to bargain collectively with the State concerning \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 560]\n\u00a0\n terms and conditions of employment which are fixed by the State's civil service laws.\n7\n This state civil service relationship is the antithesis of that established by collectively bargained contracts throughout the railroad industry. \"[E]ffective collective bargaining has been generally conceded to include the right of the representatives of the unit to be consulted and to bargain about the exceptional as well as the routine rates, rules, and working conditions.\" Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., supra, at 347. If the Federal Act applies to the Belt Railroad, then the policy of the State must give way.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n \". . . a State may not prohibit the exercise of rights which the federal Acts protect. Thus, in Hill v. Florida, \n325 \nU.S. 538\n, the State enjoined a labor union from functioning until it had complied with certain statutory requirements. The injunction was invalidated on the ground that the Wagner Act included a `federally established right to collective bargaining' with which the injunction conflicted.\" Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468, 474\n. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 561]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Under the Railway Labor Act, not only would the employees of the Belt Railroad have a federally protected right to bargain collectively with their employer, but the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement that they have negotiated with the Belt Railroad would take precedence over conflicting provisions of the state civil service laws.\n9\n In Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, \n351 \nU.S. 225, 232\n, involving 2, Eleventh, of the Railway Labor Act, which permits the negotiation of union-shop agreements notwithstanding any law of any State, we stated that \"A union agreement made pursuant to the Railway Labor Act has, therefore, the imprimatur of the federal law upon it and, by force of the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution, could not be made illegal nor vitiated by any provision of the laws of a State.\"\n\nWe turn now to the applicability of the Railway Labor Act to the Belt Railroad. Section 1, First, of that Act defines generally the carriers to which it applies as \"any carrier by railroad, subject to the Interstate Commerce Act . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) The Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 1 (1), applies to all common carriers by railroad engaged in interstate transportation. The Belt Railroad concededly is a common carrier engaged in interstate transportation. It files its tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Commission has treated it and other state-owned interstate rail carriers as \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 562]\n\u00a0\n subject to its jurisdiction. See California Canneries Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., 51 I. C. C. 500, 502-503; United States v. Belt Line R. Co., 56 I. C. C. 121; Texas State Railroad, 34 I. C. C. Val. R. 276. Finally, this Court has recognized that practice. United States v. California, \n297 \nU.S. 175, 186\n. See also, New Orleans v. Texas & P. R. Co., 195 F.2d 887, 889.\n\nWith the exception of the Supreme Court of California's holding in State v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, 37 Cal. 2d 412, 232 P.2d 857, federal statutes regulating interstate railroads, or their employees, have consistently been held to apply to publicly owned or operated railroads. Yet none of these statutes referred specifically to public railroads as being within their coverage. In United States v. California, supra, the United States sought to recover a statutory penalty for the State's operation of this Belt Railroad in violation of the Safety Appliance Act, 27 Stat. 531-532, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 2, 6. That Act applied to \"any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) The State contended there, as it does here, that the Act was inapplicable to the Belt Railroad because a federal statute is presumed not to restrict a constituent sovereign State unless it expressly so provides. This Court said that this presumption \"is an aid to consistent construction of statutes of the enacting sovereign when their purpose is in doubt, but it does not require that the aim of a statute fairly to be inferred be disregarded because not explicitly stated.\" \n297 \nU.S., at 186\n. See also, California v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 577, 585\n-586; Case v. Bowles, \n327 \nU.S. 92, 98\n-100. The Court then held unequivocally that the Safety Appliance Act was applicable to the Belt Railroad. \"We can perceive no reason for extending it [the presumption] so as to exempt a business carried on by a state from the otherwise applicable provisions of an act of Congress, all-embracing \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 563]\n\u00a0\n in scope and national in its purpose, which is as capable of being obstructed by state as by individual action.\" \n297 \nU.S., at 186\n.\n\nLikewise, three courts have ruled that the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 51, the coverage of which corresponded to that of the Safety Appliance Act, was applicable to public railroads. Mathewes v. Port Utilities Commission, 32 F.2d 913 (D.C. E. D. S. C.); Higginbotham v. Public Belt Railroad Commission, 192 La. 525, 188 So. 395 (Sup. Ct. La.); Maurice v. State, 43 Cal. App. 2d 270, 110 P.2d 706 (Cal. Dist. Ct. of App.) (involving the Belt Railroad now before us). Similarly, a Federal Court of Appeals has held that the Carriers Taxing Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 435, as amended, 45 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 261 (a companion measure of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 307, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 228a), the coverage of which was identical with that of the Railway Labor Act, was applicable to this Belt Railroad. California v. Anglim, 129 F.2d 455. At least two federal courts have taken the position that the Railway Labor Act is applicable to railroads owned or operated by the public. National Council v. Sealy, 56 F. Supp. 720, 722-723, aff'd, 152 F.2d 500, 502; New Orleans Public Belt R. Commission v. Ward, 195 F.2d 829; and see the opinion of the Attorney General of California, n. 9, supra.\n\nNothing in the legislative history of the Railway Labor Act indicates that it should be treated differently from the above-mentioned railway statutes, insofar as its applicability to a state-owned railroad is concerned. Congress apparently did not discuss the applicability of the Railway Labor Act to a state-owned railroad. This omission is readily explainable in view of the limited operations of publicly owned railroads. We are told by the parties that there are today 30 publicly owned railroads, all of which are switching or terminal roads, and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 564]\n\u00a0\n only 11 of which are operated directly by the public. The fact that Congress chose to phrase the coverage of the Act in all-embracing terms indicates that state railroads were included within it. In fact, the consistent congressional pattern in railway legislation which preceded the Railway Labor Act was to employ all-inclusive language of coverage with no suggestion that state-owned railroads were not included.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThe State contends that doubts are created about congressional intent to make the Railway Labor Act applicable to state-owned railroads by the fact that in certain other federal statutes governing employer-employee relationships, Congress has expressly exempted employees of the United States or of a State.\n11\n We believe, however, that this argument cuts the other way. When Congress wished to exclude state employees, it expressly so provided. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 565]\n\u00a0\n Its failure to do likewise in the Railway Labor Act indicates a purpose not to exclude state employees.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nThe Railway Labor Act is essentially an instrument of industry-wide government. See Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, \n325 \nU.S. 711, 749\n, 751 (dissenting opinion). The railroad world for which the Act was designed has been described as \"a state within a state. Its population of some three million, if we include the families of workers, has its own customs and its own vocabulary, and lives according to rules of its own making. . . . This \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 566]\n\u00a0\n state within a state has enjoyed a high degree of internal peace for two generations; despite the divergent interests of its component parts, the reign of law has been firmly established.\" Garrison, The National Railroad Adjustment Board; A Unique Administrative Agency, 46 Yale L. J. 567, 568-569 (1937). Congress has not only carved this singular industry out of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. 182, but it has provided, by the Railway Labor Act, techniques peculiar to that industry. An extended period of congressional experimentation in the field of railway labor legislation resulted in the Railway Labor Act and produced its machinery for conciliation, mediation, arbitration and adjustments of disputes. A primary purpose of this machinery of railway government is \"To avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier engaged therein . . . .\" 48 Stat. 1186 ( 2), 45 U.S.C. 151a. See Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 239, 242\n. Like the Safety Appliance Act, the Railway Labor Act is \"all-embracing in scope and national in its purpose, which is as capable of being obstructed by state as by individual action.\" United States v. California, \n297 \nU.S. 175, 186\n. The fact that, under state law, the employees of the Belt Railroad may have no legal right to strike\n13\n reduces, but does not eliminate, the possibility of a work stoppage. It was to meet such a possibility that the Act's \"reign of law\" was established. A terminal railroad facility like the Belt Railroad is a vital link in the national transportation system. Its continuous operation is important to the national flow of commerce.\n\nThe fact that the Act's application will supersede state civil service laws which conflict with its policy of promoting collective bargaining does not detract from the conclusion \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 567]\n\u00a0\n that Congress intended it to apply to any common carrier by railroad engaged in interstate transportation, whether or not owned or operated by a State. The principal unions in the railroad industry are national in scope, and their officials are intimately acquainted with the problems, traditions and conditions of the railroad industry. Bargaining collectively with these officials has often taken on a national flavor,\n14\n and agreements are uniformly negotiated for an entire railroad system. \"[B]reakdowns in collective bargaining will typically affect a region or the entire nation.\" Lecht, Experience under Railway Labor Legislation (1955), 4. It is by no means unreasonable to assume that Congress, aware of these characteristics of labor relations in the interconnected system which comprises our national railroad industry, intended that collective bargaining, as fostered and protected by the Railway Labor Act, should apply to all railroads. Congress no doubt concluded that a uniform method of dealing with the labor problems of the railroad industry would tend to eliminate inequities, and would promote a desirable mobility within the railroad labor force.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 568]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, the State suggests that Congress has no constitutional power to interfere with the \"sovereign right\" of a State to control its employment relationships on a state-owned railroad engaged in interstate commerce. In United States v. California, supra, this Court said that the State, although acting in its sovereign capacity in operating this Belt Railroad, necessarily so acted \"in subordination to the power to regulate interstate commerce, which has been granted specifically to the national government.\" \n297 \nU.S., at 184\n. \"California, by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has subjected itself to the commerce power, and is liable for a violation of the Safety Appliance Act, as are other carriers . . . .\" Id., at 185. That principle is no less applicable here. If California, by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, subjects itself to the commerce power so that Congress can make it conform to federal safety requirements, it also has subjected itself to that power so that Congress can regulate its employment relationships. See also, California v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 577, 586\n; cf. Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, \n351 \nU.S. 225, 233\n-238.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals accordingly is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See West's Cal. Ann. Codes, Constitution, Art. XXIV; West's Cal. Ann. Codes, Government, 18000 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioner expressly excluded from the questions presented by its petition for certiorari the following issues involved in the decision of the Court of Appeals: whether the adjudication in the state courts was res judicata in the federal courts, whether the collective-bargaining agreement had been approved by the Department of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 553, 557]\n\u00a0\n Finance of the State and, therefore, met the requirements of California law in that respect, and whether the California Personnel Board, rather than the National Railroad Adjustment Board, had jurisdiction over respondents' claims.\n\nIn its briefs before this Court, California suggests that the collective-bargaining agreement is invalid because the Board of State Harbor Commissioners lacked authority to negotiate the contract, some of the terms of which are in conflict with the state civil service laws. The Court of Appeals, however, held that this contention had been waived because it was not briefed there by the State and not mentioned in the State's oral argument. We, accordingly, do not recognize this contention here. The same argument was rejected by the California District Court of Appeal in the earlier state court litigation, State v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, 222 P.2d 27, 31-33, and the Supreme Court of California apparently did not reject that position of the appellate court, 37 Cal. 2d 412, 421-422, 232 P.2d 857, 863-864. Thus, even if the State's present suggestion were before us, we would feel constrained to accept the ruling of the District Court of Appeal.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of 1888, 25 Stat. 501; Erdman Act of 1898, 30 Stat. 424; Newlands Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 103; Adamson Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 721, see Wilson v.

That case did not concern a conflict between federally protected collective bargaining and inconsistent state laws.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] On October 30, 1944, the Attorney General of California rendered an opinion in which he concluded that the State Belt Railroad was subject to the Railway Labor Act, that the Board of Harbor Commissioners must bargain collectively with the Railroad's employees, and that the terms of the existing collective-bargaining agreement supersede conflicting provisions of the state civil service laws. 4 Op. Atty. Gen. Cal. (1944) 300-306; Rhyne, Labor Unions and Municipal Employe Law (1946), 247-251. See also, Long Island R. Co. v. Department of Labor, 256 N. Y. 498, 515-517, 177 N. E. 17, 23-24.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Although the coverage of the Act of 1888, 25 Stat. 501, the Erdman Act of 1898, 30 Stat. 424, and the Newlands Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 103, was not related to the Interstate Commerce Act, those Acts by their terms applied to any carriers by railroad engaged in interstate transportation. The cross-reference to the Interstate Commerce Act, found in the Railway Labor Act, came with the Adamson Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 721, and was carried forward to Title III of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 469. A House Committee reporting on the bill which was to become Title III of the Transportation Act stated that \"Section 300 defines the term `carrier' so that disputes of the railroads and express and sleeping-car companies, engaged in interstate commerce, are subject to the provisions of the title.\" (Emphasis supplied.) H. R. Rep. No. 456, 66th Cong., 1st Sess. 24.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The statutes cited are the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 449, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 137, 29 U.S.C. 152 (2); the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, 57 Stat. 164, 50 U.S.C.

App. 459 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] When Congress desired to make exceptions to the broad coverage of the Railway Labor Act, it expressly stated that intent in a proviso to the Act's definition of the term \"carrier\":\n\n\"SECTION 1. . . .\n\n\n\"First. . . . Provided, however, That the term `carrier' shall not include any street, interurban, or suburban electric railway, unless such railway is operating as a part of a general steam-railroad system of transportation, but shall not exclude any part of the general steam-railroad system of transportation now or hereafter operated by any other motive power. The Interstate Commerce Commission is hereby authorized and directed upon request of the Mediation Board or upon complaint of any party interested to determine after hearing whether any line operated by electric power falls within the terms of this proviso. The term `carrier' shall not include any company by reason of its being engaged in the mining of coal, the supplying of coal to a carrier where delivery is not beyond the mine tipple, and the operation of equipment or facilities therefor, or in any of such activities.\" 48 Stat. 1185-1186, 54 Stat. 785-786, 45 U.S.C. 151, First.\n\n\n In United States v. United Mine Workers, \n330 \nU.S. 258\n, this Court ruled that the general term \"employer,\" as used in the restrictive provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, and 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 738, did not include the Federal Government, and that an injunction could issue in a federal court to prevent a union and its officers from precipitating a strike in the bituminous coal mines which, at the time, were being operated by the Government. That case is not a guide here since the statutes there involved differ widely in history and purpose from the Railway Labor Act. See Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River & I. R. Co., \n353 \nU.S. 30, 39\n-42.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See the Los Angeles Building Council case, n. 7, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Lecht, Experience under Railway Labor Legislation (1955), 4, 70-71, 158, 161, 167-168, 177, 192, 209, 225, 233.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Congress clearly had considerations such as these in mind in 1951 when it authorized union-shop agreements, notwithstanding any state law. See n. 6, supra. The House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce stated that -\n\n\"It will be noted that the proposed paragraph eleventh would authorize agreements notwithstanding the laws of any State. For the following reasons, among others, it is the view of the committee that if, as a matter of national policy, such agreements are to be permitted in the railroad and airline industries it would be wholly impracticable and unworkable for the various States to regulate such agreements.

The District Court granted the motions, on the ground that probable cause had been lacking for issuance of the arrest warrants. Urging that, without the evidence that had been seized and suppressed, it would have to dismiss the indictment for want of sufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution, the Government appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which reversed the District Court.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioners were arrested in February 1954 on John Doe warrants and subsequently were indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, with two others, for violations of the local lottery laws and for conspiracy to carry on a lottery.\n1\n After indictment each filed a pre-trial motion under Rule 41 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\n2\n asking for the suppression of evidence seized from his person at the time of his arrest. The District Court granted petitioners' motions to suppress, on the ground that probable cause had been lacking for the issuance of the arrest warrants directed against them.\n3\n 126 F. Supp. 620. The Government \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 397]\n\u00a0\n appealed the order for suppression to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The indictment against petitioners had not been dismissed, but the Government informed the Court of Appeals that, without the \"numbers\" paraphernalia seized and suppressed, it would lack sufficient evidence to proceed on any of the counts involving petitioners and therefore would have to dismiss the indictment. Petitioners challenged the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to hear an appeal by the Government from an order of the District Court granting a motion to suppress that was made while an indictment was pending in the same District Court. The Court of Appeals sustained its jurisdiction on the authority of its prior decision in United States v. Cefaratti,\n4\n and reversed the district judge on the merits, holding that there had been probable cause to justify the issuance of warrants for the arrest of petitioners. 98 U.S. App. D.C. 244, 234 F.2d 679. We granted certiorari, limited to the question of appealability of the suppression order, because of the importance of that question to the administration of the federal criminal laws. \n352 \nU.S. 906\n.\n\nThe Government contends, most broadly, that the suppression order of any District Court is \"final\" and sufficiently separable and collateral to the criminal case to be appealable under the general authority of 28 U.S.C. 1291, notwithstanding that such an order is not listed \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 398]\n\u00a0\n among the few types of orders in criminal cases from which the Government may appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3731.\n5\n More narrowly, failing acceptance of the position \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 399]\n\u00a0\n just stated, the Government maintains that an order of suppression is, within the criminal case, a \"final\" order and thus appealable under the statutory provisions for appeals by the Government in criminal cases that are applicable exclusively in the District of Columbia.\n6\n It will be convenient to discuss the issues in the same order.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIt is axiomatic, as a matter of history as well as doctrine, that the existence of appellate jurisdiction in a specific federal court over a given type of case is dependent upon authority expressly conferred by statute. And since the jurisdictional statutes prevailing at any given time are so much a product of the whole history of both growth and limitation of federal-court jurisdiction since the First Judiciary Act, 1 Stat. 73, they have always been interpreted in the light of that history and of the axiom that clear statutory mandate must exist to found jurisdiction. It suffices to cite as authority for these principles some of the cases in which they have been applied to the general problem now before us, the availability of appellate review sought by the Government in criminal cases. E. g., United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159; United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310\n; In re Heath, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 400]\n\u00a0\n \n144 \nU.S. 92\n; Cross v. United States, \n145 \nU.S. 571\n; United States v. Burroughs, \n289 \nU.S. 159\n.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThere is a further principle, also supported by the history of federal appellate jurisdiction, that importantly pertains to the present problem. That is the concept that in the federal jurisprudence, at least,\n8\n appeals by the Government in criminal cases are something unusual, exceptional, not favored. The history shows resistance of the Court to the opening of an appellate route for the Government until it was plainly provided by the Congress, and after that a close restriction of its uses to those authorized by the statute. Indeed, it was 100 years before the defendant in a criminal case, even a capital case, was afforded appellate review as of right.\n9\n And \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 401]\n\u00a0\n after review on behalf of convicted defendants was made certain by the Acts of 1889 and 1891, the Court continued to withhold an equivalent remedy from the Government, despite the existence of colorable statutory authority for permitting the Government to appeal in those important cases where a prosecution was dismissed upon the trial court's opinion of the proper construction or the constitutional validity of a federal statute.\n10\n When the Congress responded to the problem of such cases, in the Criminal Appeals Act of 1907, now 18 U.S.C. 3731, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 402]\n\u00a0\n it did so with careful expression of the limited types of orders in criminal cases as to which the Government might thenceforth have review.\n11\n It was as late as 1942 before the Criminal Appeals Act was amended to permit appeals by the Government from decisions, granting dismissal or arrest of judgment, other than those grounded \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 403]\n\u00a0\n by the trial court upon the construction or invalidity of a statute.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nIt is true that certain orders relating to a criminal case may be found to possess sufficient independence from the main course of the prosecution to warrant treatment as plenary orders, and thus be appealable on the authority of 28 U.S.C. 1291 without regard to the limitations of 18 U.S.C. 3731, just as in civil litigation orders of equivalent distinctness are appealable on the same authority without regard to the limitations of 28 U.S.C. 1292.\n13\n The instances in criminal cases are very few. The only decision of this Court applying to a criminal case the reasoning of Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541\n, held that an order relating to the amount of bail to be exacted falls into this category. Stack v. Boyle, \n342 \nU.S. 1\n. Earlier cases illustrated, sometimes without discussion, that under certain conditions orders for the suppression or return of illegally seized property are appealable at once, as where the motion is made prior to indictment,\n14\n or in a different district from that in which the trial will occur,\n15\n or after dismissal of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 404]\n\u00a0\n case,\n16\n or perhaps where the emphasis is on the return of property rather than its suppression as evidence.\n17\n In such cases, as appropriate, the Government as well as the moving person has been permitted to appeal from an adverse decision. Burdeau v. McDowell, \n256 \nU.S. 465\n.\n\nBut a motion made by a defendant after indictment and in the district of trial has none of the aspects of independence just noted, as the Court held in Cogen v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 221\n. As the opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis explains, the denial of a pre-trial motion in this posture is interlocutory in form and real effect, and thus not appealable at the instance of the defendant. We think the granting of such a motion also has an interlocutory character, and therefore cannot be the subject of an appeal by the Government. In the present case the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 405]\n\u00a0\n Government argues, as it offered to stipulate below, that the effect of suppressing the evidence seized from petitioners at their arrests will be to force dismissal of the indictment for lack of evidence on which to go forward. But that is not a necessary result of a suppression order relating to particular items of evidence, nor have we been shown whether it will be the result in practice in the generality of cases. Appeal rights cannot depend on the facts of a particular case. The Congress necessarily has had to draw the jurisdictional statutes in terms of categories. To fit an order granting suppression before trial in a criminal case into the category of \"final decisions\" requires a straining that is not permissible in the light of the principles and the history concerning criminal appeals, especially Government appeals, that are outlined above and more fully set forth in the cases cited.\n18\n Other Courts of Appeals that have considered the problem have concluded that this order is not \"final\" or appealable at the behest of the Government.\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 406]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Government exhorts us not to exalt form over substance, in contending that the present order has virtually the same attributes as the suppression orders found reviewable in earlier cases. We do not agree that the order entered in a pending criminal case has the same characteristics of independence and completeness as a suppression order entered under other circumstances. Moreover, in a limited sense, form is substance with respect to ascertaining the existence of appellate jurisdiction. While it is always necessary to categorize a situation realistically, to place a given order according to its real effect, it remains true that the categories themselves were defined by the Congress in terms of form. Many interlocutory decisions of a trial court may be of grave importance to a litigant, yet are not amenable to appeal at the time entered, and some are never satisfactorily reviewable. In particular is this true of the Government in a criminal case, for there is no authority today for interlocutory appeals,\n20\n and even if the Government had a general right to review upon an adverse conclusion of a case after trial, much of what it might complain of would have been swallowed up in the sanctity of the jury's verdict.\n21\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 407]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf there is serious need for appeals by the Government from suppression orders, or unfairness to the interests of effective criminal law enforcement in the distinctions we have referred to, it is the function of the Congress to decide whether to initiate a departure from the historical pattern of restricted appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases.\n22\n We must decide the case on the statutes that \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 408]\n\u00a0\n exist today, in the light of what has been the development of the jurisdiction. It is only through legislative resolution, furthermore, that peripheral questions regarding the conduct of government appeals in this situation can be regulated. Some of the problems directed at legislative judgment involve such particulars as confinement or bail of the defendant, acceleration of the Government's appeal, and discretionary limitation of the right to take the appeal.\n23\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals sustained its jurisdiction on the basis of statutory provisions peculiar to the District of Columbia. Here again, the jurisdictional statutes are a product of historical development, and must be interpreted in that light. During the century from 1801 to 1901 the Congress several times organized and reorganized the courts of the District of Columbia, independently of the federal courts in the States. It is not necessary here to relate the chronology of shuffled jurisdictions and \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 409]\n\u00a0\n nomenclature.\n24\n It is sufficient to note that from 1838 on, review of a final judgment of conviction in the criminal trial court was available in the appellate tribunal of the District.\n25\n However, the appellate judgment was not further reviewable in this Court in any manner during this period. In re Heath, \n144 \nU.S. 92\n; Cross v. United States, \n145 \nU.S. 571\n. When the Acts of 1889 and 1891 opened up appellate review of criminal convictions in the federal courts throughout the country, at first directly to this Court, it was held that those statutes did not apply to cases originating in the District of Columbia. Ibid.\n\nIn 1901 the Congress codified the laws of the District of Columbia, including those relating to the judicial system. District of Columbia Code, 31 Stat. 1189. Criminal jurisdiction was vested in the trial court of general jurisdiction, then known as the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.\n26\n A single section of the statute, 226, conferred appellate jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals over decisions of the Supreme Court in general terms, apparently including criminal decisions. A party aggrieved could take an appeal from a final order or judgment, and was entitled to allowance of an appeal from an interlocutory order affecting possession of property. In addition, the Court of Appeals could allow an \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 410]\n\u00a0\n appeal, in its discretion, from any other interlocutory order when it was shown \"that it will be in the interest of justice to allow such appeal.\"\n27\n\u00a0\n\nSection 935 of the Code of 1901 established this new provision:\n\n \"In all criminal prosecutions the United States or the District of Columbia, as the case may be, shall have the same right of appeal that is given to the defendant, including the right to a bill of exceptions: Provided, That if on such appeal it shall be found that there was error in the rulings of the court during the trial, a verdict in favor of the defendant shall not be set aside.\" 31 Stat. 1341.\n\n\n The legislative history of the Code does not indicate why the Government was now given a right of appeal, but we may surmise that the draftsmen of the Code desired to adopt a procedural technique that was then in force in a large number of States.\n28\n The \"same right of appeal that is given to the defendant\" would be defined by reference to 226, of course, in cases coming up from the Supreme Court. After the Congress conferred on the United \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 411]\n\u00a0\n States a more limited right of appeal from the District Courts in the Criminal Appeals Act of 1907, running directly to this Court, it was held that the 1907 Act was not applicable to cases decided in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. There 935 provided \"the complete appellate system.\" United States v. Burroughs, \n289 \nU.S. 159, 164\n. When the Criminal Appeals Act was broadened in 1942, it was then first made applicable to the District of Columbia.\n29\n But the text of 935 was not repealed at that time, nor was it repealed in connection with the 1948 revisions of the Judicial Code and the Criminal Code.\n30\n It may be concluded, then, that even today criminal appeals by the Government in the District of Columbia are not limited to the categories set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3731, although as to cases of the type covered by that special jurisdictional statute, its explicit directions will prevail over the general terms of 935, now found in the District of Columbia Code, 1951 Edition, as 23-105. United States v. Hoffman, 82 U.S. App. D.C. 153, 161 F.2d 881, decided on merits, \n335 \nU.S. 77\n.\n\nMeanwhile, under the general provisions of 226 of the 1901 Code, the practice had developed of allowing appeals from interlocutory orders in criminal cases. A particular instance disturbed the Congress in 1926, and it immediately passed a statute to eliminate the practice. It is apparent from the legislative history that it was interlocutory appeals for the defendant that were considered anomalous in a federal court and undesirable from the viewpoint of prompt dispatch of criminal prosecutions,\n31\n but the new provision in terms applied equally to the possibility of an interlocutory appeal being allowed \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 412]\n\u00a0\n to the Government through the combined provisions of 226 and 935. The 1926 enactment, as it now reads in the District of Columbia Code, 1951 Edition, 17-102, states:\n\n  \"Nothing contained in any Act of Congress shall  be construed to empower the United States Court of  Appeals for the District of Columbia to allow an  appeal from any interlocutory order entered in any  criminal action or proceeding or to entertain any  such appeal heretofore or hereafter allowed or taken.\"  44 Stat. 831, as amended, 48 Stat. 926.\n\n\n The allowance of appeal technique no longer exists as to cases coming from the District Court (the former Supreme Court), but if this section does not continue to have life by force of the words \"or hereafter . . . taken,\" it does not matter, for 226 itself was replaced in 1949\n32\n by the nationwide appellate jurisdiction provisions of Title 28 of the U.S. Code, 1291 and 1292, which do not authorize interlocutory appeals in criminal cases.\n\nThus the statutory context in which the court below made its ruling is seen to be this: Subject to stated limitations, the Government has the \"same right of appeal\" as the defendant in criminal cases in the District Court for the District of Columbia, but no party can appeal an interlocutory order in such cases. In United States v. Cefaratti, 91 U.S. App. D.C. 297, 202 F.2d 13, the Court of Appeals reconciled these rules by holding:\n\n\"Since defendants may appeal from `final decisions,' to say that `the United States . . . shall have the same right of appeal that is given to the defendant . . .' means that . . . the United States may appeal from final decisions. It does not mean that the United States cannot appeal from a final decision \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 413]\n\u00a0\n unless it so happens that an opposite decision would also have been final.\" 91 U.S. App. D.C., at 302, 202 F.2d, at 17.\n\n\n Applying this reasoning to orders for the suppression of evidence, the Court of Appeals concluded that such an order had the requisite finality and independence of the criminal case to be appealable under 28 U.S.C. 1291. In the present case, the court below reaffirmed its Cefaratti analysis. Insofar as these decisions, resting on opinions of this Court,\n33\n imply a reviewability for suppression orders that would be general to cases from all Federal District Courts, we have already indicated our disagreement earlier in this opinion.\n\nBut the Government contends that appealability under the District of Columbia statutes, though it requires a \"final decision,\" does not call for the independent or separable character of the orders in the cases relied on by the Court of Appeals, because here it is not essential to characterize an order as plenary or disassociated from the criminal case, inasmuch as the Government has a comprehensive right of appeal within a criminal case in the District of Columbia. We do not agree that the standard of \"final decisions\" as prerequisite to appeal is something less or different under 28 U.S.C. 1291 as the successor to 226 of the District of Columbia Code of 1901 than it is under 1291 as the successor to the nationally applicable appeal provisions of the Judicial Code. Cf. Stack v. Boyle, \n342 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 12. By this we do not mean to say that 935 of the 1901 Code is no broader than 18 U.S.C. 3731, but merely that the underlying concepts of finality are the same in each case.\n\nAs the outline of the statutory development demonstrates, both this Court and the Congress have been strict \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 414]\n\u00a0\n in confining rights of appeal in criminal cases in the District of Columbia to those plainly authorized by statute. We do not believe that the combined provisions of the 1901 and 1926 enactments permit the Government to appeal in any situation where the decision against it may have some characteristics of finality, yet does not either terminate the prosecution or pertain to an independent peripheral matter such as would be appealable in other federal courts on the authority of Stack v. Boyle, supra. The 1901 Code gave the Government \"the same right of appeal that is given to the defendant,\" while the 1926 amendment to the Code restricted the defendant's right of appeal to those decisions of the Supreme Court (now District Court) that have a \"final\" effect, as that term is understood in defining appellate jurisdiction. We conclude that full force cannot be given to the limitations imposed on criminal appeals in the District of Columbia unless the Government is restricted as is the defendant. This is not to say \"that the United States cannot appeal from a final decision unless it so happens that an opposite decision would also have been final,\" as the Court of Appeals suggested in Cefaratti. Quite to the contrary, our holding is that the statutory provisions applicable to the District of Columbia, subject to the further limitations stated therein, afford the Government an appeal only from an order against it which terminates a prosecution or makes a decision whose distinct or plenary character meets the standards of the precedents applicable to finality problems in all federal courts.\n34\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 415]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn thus defining the Government's appeal rights under 935 of the 1901 Code, we are mindful of the considerations that motivated the Congress to specify in 1926 that interlocutory appeals in criminal cases were not possible:\n\n \"Promptness in the dispatch of the criminal business  of the courts is by all recognized as in the highest  degree desirable. Greater expedition is demanded  by a wholesome public opinion.\" S. Rep. No. 926,  69th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n And cf. H. R. Rep. No. 1363, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. Delays in the prosecution of criminal cases are numerous and lengthy enough without sanctioning appeals that are not plainly authorized by statute. We cannot do so here without a much clearer mandate than exists in the present terms and the historical development of the relevant provisions. Cf. United States v. Burroughs, \n289 \nU.S. 159\n; United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310\n.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioners were charged with carrying on a lottery known as the \"numbers game,\" a violation of D.C.

If the motion is granted the property shall be restored unless otherwise subject to lawful detention and it shall not be admissible in evidence at any hearing or trial. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioners' individual motions were each captioned \"Motion to Suppress `Arrest Warrant'\" and asked only for suppression of the evidence taken from the person at the arrest. The District Court also granted in part a motion, made on behalf of all the defendants, relating to the seizure of evidence under search warrants at two homes. The Government makes some point of characterizing this as a motion for the return of property. It was captioned \"Motion to Suppress Evidence and Return Property,\" but the body of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 397]\n\u00a0\n motion asked only that the evidence seized at those places be suppressed. We find it unnecessary to decide whether this was a motion \"for return of property,\" or whether that would make a difference in the question of appealability on these facts, for the Court of Appeals, when it reached the merits of the issue of probable cause, dealt only with the warrants for the arrest of petitioners. Hence we limit our consideration of the case to that aspect of the District Court's order for suppression.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 91 U.S. App. D.C. 297, 202 F.2d 13, as explained in United States v.

Code, 1951, 17-102: \"Nothing contained in any Act of Congress shall be construed to empower the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to allow an appeal from any interlocutory order entered in any criminal action or proceeding or to entertain any such appeal heretofore or hereafter allowed or taken.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See also Cobbledick v.

Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310, 312\n-318; S. Rep. No. 5650, 59th Cong., 2d Sess.; H. R. Rep. No. 45, 77th Cong., 1st Sess. 2-3. See also Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The Act of February 6, 1889, 25 Stat. 656, authorized direct review in the Supreme Court by writ of error \"in all cases of conviction of crime the punishment of which provided by law is death, tried before any court of the United States . . . .\" Two years later the Circuit Courts of Appeals Act extended the jurisdiction for direct review to all \"cases of conviction of a capital or otherwise infamous crime.\" 26 Stat. 827. The burden upon this Court of hearing the large number of criminal cases led, in 1897, to transfer of the jurisdiction over convictions in noncapital cases to the Circuit Courts of Appeals. 29 Stat. 492. Section 238 of the Judicial Code completed the retrenchment in 1911 by eliminating direct review of capital cases. 36 Stat. 1157. See Frankfurter and Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court (1928), 109-113. Prior to the Acts of 1889 and 1891, there was no jurisdictional provision for appeal or writ of error in criminal cases. United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159; see United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310, 319\n. A question of law arising in a case tried by a Circuit Court of two judges, if they disagreed on the question, could be brought \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 401]\n\u00a0\n here upon a certificate of division of opinion, at the request of either party, and (except during one two-year period) without awaiting the final outcome of the case in the Circuit Court. 2 Stat. 159; 17 Stat. 196; R. S. 651. See United States v. Sanges, supra, at 320-321. The availability of this procedure for review, haphazard at best because dependent on disagreement between the two sitting judges, came to be very much diluted by the increasing frequency with which the Circuit Courts were conducted by a single judge. See Frankfurter and Landis, 79, 109.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Act of 1891 included as a category of cases subject to direct review by this Court, \"any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States . . . is drawn in question.\" 26 Stat. 828. But in United States v. Sanges, supra, the Court related the history of repeated rejections of Government criminal appeals, noted that the Act expressly conferred appellate jurisdiction in \"cases of conviction,\" and held that the Act did not sufficiently demonstrate congressional intent to have criminal cases reviewed at the behest of the Government, either in this Court or in the Circuit Courts of Appeals. The Court said: \"It is impossible to presume an intention on the part of Congress to make so serious and far-reaching an innovation in the criminal jurisprudence of the United States.\" \n144 \nU.S., at 323\n. Similarly, after review of noncapital convictions was again committed to the Circuit Courts of Appeals in 1897, it was held that upon a reversal of a conviction by that court, the Government could not bring the case here through the certiorari jurisdiction that had also been created by the Act of 1891. United States v. Dickinson, \n213 \nU.S. 92\n. Section 240 of the Judicial Code later conferred this jurisdiction explicitly. 36 Stat. 1157.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The 1907 enactment, 34 Stat. 1246, authorized direct review in this Court by writ of error in the same three classes of cases, roughly speaking, as are listed in the first four paragraphs of the present 18 U.S.C. 3731, quoted in note 5, supra. The original Act also included the provisions protective of the defendant in the last two paragraphs quoted there, relating to expedition of the Government appeal and bail on his own recognizance, and the original Act had additional cautionary provisions, commanding precedence for these cases and barring the writ of error \"in any case where there has been a verdict in favor of the defendant.\" The legislative history emphasizes the awareness of the Congress that Government appeals in criminal cases were a sharp innovation and congressional concern that such jurisdiction should go no farther at that time than the immediate problem of affording review for trial court opinions as to the construction or validity of federal statutes. In brief, the development of the Criminal Appeals Act was this: The House bill proposed adoption of the language of the District of Columbia Code of 1901, which had given the Government \"the same right of appeal that is given to the defendant . . . .\" (Quoted, note 6, supra, and discussed later in this opinion.) The Senate Committee on the Judiciary substituted a more specifically drawn measure, dividing the jurisdiction between this Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals along the line the 1891 Act had drawn for civil cases. After lengthy floor debate, in which various objections to the measure were put forth, it was amended on the floor by narrowing the classes of cases in which the Government could seek review, by limiting the jurisdiction to direct review here, and by adding the protective provisions noted above. The House accepted the Senate product. See H. R. Rep. No. 2119, 59th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 3922, 59th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 5650, 59th Cong., 2d Sess.; H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 8113, 59th Cong., 2d Sess.; 40 Cong. Rec. 8695, 9032-9033; 41 Cong. Rec. 2190-2197, 2745-2763, 2818-2825, 3044-3047. See also Frankfurter and Landis, 114-119.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] 56 Stat. 271. See H. R. Rep. No. 45, 77th Cong., 1st Sess. In these new categories of cases the appeal was directed to the Court of Appeals. The present version of the added language is quoted, as the fifth through seventh paragraphs of 18 U.S.C. 3731, in note 5, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541, 545\n-547; Swift & Co. v. Compania Caribe, \n339 \nU.S. 684, 688\n-689; and cases cited.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] E. g., Perlman v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 7\n; Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 344\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Cf. Dier v. Banton, \n262 \nU.S. 147\n. Rule 41 (e) explicitly authorizes making the motion in a different district: \"A person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may move the district court for the district in which the property was seized for the return of the property and to suppress for use as evidence anything so obtained . . . . The motion to suppress evidence may also be made in the district where the trial is to be had. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] E. g., Dickhart v. United States, 57 App. D.C. 5, 16 F.2d 345. That was a motion, after acquittal in a case under the National Prohibition Act, 41 Stat. 305, to regain possession of liquor that had been seized. See also note 17, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] E. g., Steele v. United States No. 1, \n267 \nU.S. 498\n; United States v. Kirschenblatt, 16 F.2d 202; cf. also Steele v. United States No. 2, \n267 \nU.S. 505\n; Dowling v. Collins, 10 F.2d 62. We do not suggest that a motion made under Rule 41 (e) gains or loses appealability simply upon whether it asks return or suppression or both. The cases just cited arose under the National Prohibition Act, which provided an independent proceeding to secure the return of property seized under a search warrant that had been issued wrongfully. 41 Stat. 315, adopting 40 Stat. 228. That factor underlay the discussion of this category of orders as appealable in Cogen v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 221, 225\n-227. The \"essential character and the circumstances under which it is made\" determine whether a motion is an independent proceeding or merely a step in the criminal case. Id., at 225; cf. United States v. Wallace & Tiernan Co., \n336 \nU.S. 793, 801\n-803. We think that a contemporary illustration of this category is United States v. Ponder, 238 F.2d 825, where the suppression order related to a plenary proceeding that had been brought in order to impound election records for investigation by the Department of Justice and the grand jury.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] See especially United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310\n; Cross v. United States, \n145 \nU.S. 571\n; cf. Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 124\n-134.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] United States v. Rosenwasser, 145 F.2d 1015 (C. A. 9th Cir.); cf. United States v. Janitz, 161 F.2d 19 (C. A. 3d Cir.) (order made at trial); United States v. Williams, 227 F.2d 149 (C. A. 4th Cir.) (motion made before indictment); see United States v. One 1946 Plymouth Sedan, 167 F.2d 3, 8-9 (C. A. 7th Cir.). The court below has held a pre-trial order suppressing wiretap evidence to be interlocutory, distinguishing its ruling in the Cefaratti case on the basis that the prohibition of Rule 41 (e) against reviving the issue of admissibility at the trial does not apply to wiretap evidence. United States v. Stephenson, 96 U.S. App. D.C. 44, 223 F.2d 336. We express no opinion as to this distinction, in view of our disposition of the present case. An appeal by the United States was treated on the merits without discussion of appealability, where the move for return of papers was made after indictment, in United States v. Kirschenblatt, 16 F.2d 202 (C. A. 2d Cir.). That proceeding had elements of independent \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 406]\n\u00a0\n character because of its statutory context under the National Prohibition Act. Likewise, United States v. Ponder, 238 F.2d 825 (C. A. 4th Cir.), which has some broad language favoring appealability for the Government, on its facts was seen by the court as a proceeding independent of the pending criminal case. See note 17, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] For an earlier technique, see note 9, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] See United States v. Ball, \n163 \nU.S. 662, 671\n; Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 124\n-134. Under the District of Columbia Code of 1901, to be discussed later in this opinion, the Government was granted \"the same right of appeal that is given to the defendant, . . . Provided, That if on such appeal it shall be found that there was error in the rulings of the court during the trial, a verdict in favor of the defendant shall \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 407]\n\u00a0\n not be set aside.\" 31 Stat. 1341. It was soon held that the effect of the proviso was to preclude entirely the taking of an appeal by the Government after a verdict for the defendant. United States v. Evans, 30 App. D.C. 58, approved, \n213 \nU.S. 297\n; see United States v. Martin, 81 A. 2d 651, 652-653 (Mun. Ct. App.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] In the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, the Congress enacted the following provision in a new chapter being added to Title 18 of the U.S. Code (Supp. IV, 1957): \" 1404. Motion to suppress - appeal by the United States \"In addition to any other right to appeal, the United States shall have the right to appeal from an order granting a motion for the return of seized property and to suppress evidence made before the trial of a person charged with a violation of -   [designated narcotics offenses] \"This section shall not apply with respect to any such motion unless the United States attorney shall certify, to the judge granting such motion, that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay. Any appeal under this section shall be taken within 30 days after the date the order was entered and shall be diligently prosecuted.\" 70 Stat. 573. The legislative history shows that the Department of Justice expressed a preference for the passage of other bills, which had been introduced to amend 18 U.S.C. 3731 so as to authorize Government appeals from suppression orders in all federal prosecutions, and without the qualification requiring certification by the United States Attorney. See S. Rep. No. 1997, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. 19. The need for the enactment of the more limited measure was stated by the respective committees, which were aware of some of the prior court decisions, including those of the District of Columbia Circuit in Cefaratti and the instant case. See id., at 11, 15, 26; S. Rep. No. 2033, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. 16-19, 28; H. R. Rep. No. 2388, 84th \n\n[354 \nU.S. 394, 408]\n\u00a0\n Cong., 2d Sess. 5; Hearing before the Subcommittee on Improvements in the Federal Criminal Code of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on S. 3760, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. 7-11, 38-43. The more general bills referred to by the Department of Justice were S. 3423 and H. R. 9364, of the 84th Congress. In the current session of the 85th Congress, a bill to the same effect, H. R. 263, has been introduced.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Thus, the Criminal Appeals Act has provided for bail on the defendant's own recognizance, and the bills listed in note 22, supra, would extend that provision to defendants pending Government appeals from suppression orders, while the appeal section enacted in the Narcotic Control Act of 1956 does not refer to bail. Both Acts and the bills have the same acceleration provision, albeit the 30-day period was much more of a speed-up when the Criminal Appeals Act was drawn in 1907 than it is today. Cf. Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., 37 (a) (2); 28 U.S.C. 2107. Only the Narcotic Control Act requires an express certification that the government appeal is not taken for purposes of delay.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] See Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364, 366-368; Frankfurter and Landis, 120-124.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] 5 Stat. 307; Dist. Col. R. S. 845.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] 31 Stat. 1202. There was also a Police Court, given concurrent jurisdiction over misdemeanors, which now is known as the criminal branch of the Municipal Court. 31 Stat. 1196; D.C. Code, 1951, 11-755. In order to simplify the discussion, we shall not refer in this opinion to the appellate jurisdiction that has existed, in changing forms, from the decisions of this inferior court. See D.C. Code, 1951, 11-772, 11-773; United States v. Martin, 81 A. 2d 651 (Mun. Ct. App.); United States v. Basiliko, 35 A. 2d 185 (Mun. Ct. App.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] 31 Stat. 1225. The relevant text of 226 was: \"Any party aggrieved by any final order, judgment, or decree of the supreme court of the District of Columbia . . . may appeal therefrom to the said court of appeals; . . . . Appeals shall also be allowed to said court of appeals from all interlocutory orders of the supreme court of the District of Columbia . . . whereby the possession of property is changed or affected, such as orders for the appointment of receivers, granting injunctions, dissolving writs of attachment, and the like; and also from any other interlocutory order, in the discretion of the said court of appeals, whenever it is made to appear to said court upon petition that it will be in the interest of justice to allow such appeal.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] A list of state provisions was submitted to the Congress in 1907 in connection with the Criminal Appeals Act.

SHAUGHNESSY(1957)\nNo. 71\nArgued: Decided: March 11, 1957\n\n\n\n\n1. \nIn a suit by an alien in a federal district court against a District Director of Immigration for (1) a declaratory judgment that he is eligible for suspension of deportation under 19 (c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended, and (2) to restrain the District Director from taking him into custody for deportation, neither the Attorney General nor the Commissioner of Immigration is a necessary party. Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, \n349 \nU.S. 48\n. Pp. 603-604.\n\n2. \nAn alien was admitted to the United States during World War II for permanent residence. While his country was still a neutral, he applied to a local Selective Service Board for exemption from military service as a neutral alien. The Board took no action on that application. After his country had become a cobelligerent with the United States, the local board classified the alien as available for military service; he reported for a physical examination; but he failed to pass and was reclassified as physically defective, Held: By his application for exemption as a neutral alien, he was debarred from citizenship under 3 (a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940; and, therefore, he is not now eligible for a suspension of deportation under 19 (c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended. Pp. 600-606.\n\n (a) The alien's voluntary act of executing, filing, and allowing to remain on file, a legally sufficient application for exemption from military service as a neutral alien, effected his debarment from citizenship under 3 (a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 - even though the local board never took any action on his application. Pp. 604-605.\n\n\n (b) Section 315 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which makes an alien permanently ineligible for citizenship only when he has both applied for and received exemption from military service or training, is not applicable to this case, because this alien's application for suspension of deportation was filed before enactment of that Act. Pp. 605-606.\n\n\n 229 F.2d 592, affirmed. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 599, 600]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSidney Kansas argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nOscar H. Davis argued the cause for respondent. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis declaratory judgment action was brought by petitioner, in March 1955 in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, to obtain a judgment against the District Director of Immigration declaring that petitioner was eligible for suspension of deportation and restraining the Director from taking him into custody for deportation.\n1\n The District Court dismissed the complaint, without reaching the merits, upon the procedural ground \"that the Attorney General [of the United States] and\/or the Commissioner [of Immigration] are indispensable parties to the instant action.\"\n2\n The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, not only for the reason given by the District Court, but also upon the ground that, because the petitioner is \"an alien who `has made application' to be relieved from military service,\" he is debarred from citizenship as a matter of law and \"hence is not eligible for an order suspending deportation.\"\n3\n This Court granted certiorari.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nDeportation proceedings had been instituted because petitioner had entered the United States on April 2, 1951, on a temporary visa and remained beyond the period for \n\n[352 \nU.S. 599, 601]\n\u00a0\n which he was admitted. Petitioner was found deportable but was given permission to depart voluntarily, in lieu of deportation. Petitioner's timely application for suspension of deportation under 19 (c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended,\n5\n was denied by the Immigration and Naturalization Service because it found that petitioner did not satisfy a prerequisite for the application of that section - eligibility for naturalization. His ineligibility was based on a finding that in August 1943 petitioner, as a citizen and subject of Colombia, then a World War II neutral, applied under 3 (a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, for relief from service with the United States armed forces. Section 3 (a) provided that \"any person who makes such application shall thereafter be debarred from becoming a citizen of the United States.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 599, 602]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe petitioner was admitted to the United States for permanent residence in February 1942, during World War II. On June 16, 1943, he executed Selective Service System Form DSS 304, \"Alien's Personal History and Statement,\" which gave the alien a choice of inserting \"do\" or \"do not\" in the statement: \"I . . . . . object to service in the land or naval forces of the United States.\" The petitioner inserted the word \"do.\" The form contained this notice:\n\n \". . . If you are a citizen or subject of a neutral country, and you do not wish to serve in the land or naval forces of the United States, you may apply to your local board for Application by Alien for Relief from Military Service (Form 301) which, when executed by you and filed with the local board, will relieve you from the obligation to serve in the land or naval forces of the United States, but will also debar you from thereafter becoming a citizen of the United States.\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\n\n On August 26, 1943, the petitioner executed Form DSS 301, \"Application by Alien for Relief from Military Service.\" The form contained the following paragraph:\n\n \"I do hereby make application to be relieved from liability for training and service in the land or naval forces of the United States, under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, in accordance with the act of Congress, approved December 20, 1941. I understand that the making of this application to be relieved from such liability \n\n[352 \nU.S. 599, 603]\n\u00a0\n will debar me from becoming a citizen of the United States. . . .\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n Selective Service Regulations required the local board to follow prescribed formalities to place a neutral applying for relief from service in Class IV-C and to notify the alien of the classification.\n9\n The board did not comply with these regulations in petitioner's case. Its first formal action was taken after the Selective Service System notified the board, on December 20, 1943, that Colombia, on November 26, 1943, had changed its neutral status to that of a cobelligerent with the United States. On January 27, 1944, five months after the petitioner filed the Form DSS 301, the board notified the petitioner that he was classified I-A, available for military service, and ordered him to report for preinduction physical examination. He reported as ordered, but failed to pass the physical examination and, on March 2, 1944, was reclassified IV-F, physically defective.\n\nThe petitioner argues that neither the Attorney General nor the Commissioner of Immigration is a necessary party to this action. The respondent offers no argument in opposition. We hold that neither the Attorney General nor the Commissioner is a necessary party. This Court in Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, \n349 \nU.S. 48\n, held that determination of the question of indispensability of parties is dependent, not on the nature of the decision attacked, but on the ability and authority of the defendant before the court to effectuate the relief which the alien seeks. In this case the petitioner asks to have the order of deportation suspended and to restrain the District Director from deporting him. Because the District \n\n[352 \nU.S. 599, 604]\n\u00a0\n Director is the official who would execute the deportation, he is a sufficient party. It is not a basis for distinction of Pedreiro that suspension of deportation, rather than deportation itself, is involved in this action.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThe petitioner's argument on the merits challenges the holding of the Court of Appeals that the execution and filing of Form DSS 301 had the effect as a matter of law of debarring him from becoming a citizen of the United States. He contends that debarment could result only if the local board affirmatively granted the relief applied for by classifying him IV-C on its records and giving him notice of its action. We hold that the petitioner's voluntary act of executing and filing, and allowing to remain on file, the legally sufficient application Form DSS 301 effected his debarment from citizenship under 3 (a).\n11\n The explicit terms of the section debar the neutral alien \"who makes such application\" for immunity from military service.\n\nLegislative history shows this to be the effect contemplated by Congress.\n12\n This same construction has been adopted in the few court decisions which refer to the section,\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 599, 605]\n\u00a0\n and administrative construction has consistently given the section this meaning.\n14\n The neutral alien in this country during the war was at liberty to refuse to bear arms to help us win the struggle, but the price he paid for his unwillingness was permanent debarment from United States citizenship.\n\nThe petitioner argues that in any event 315 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952,\n15\n and not \n\n[352 \nU.S. 599, 606]\n\u00a0\n 3 (a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, governs this case. Section 315 of the 1952 Act enacts a two-pronged requirement for the determination of permanent ineligibility for citizenship: the alien must be one \"who applies or has applied for exemption,\" and also one who \"is or was relieved or discharged from such training or service on such ground.\" That section has no application here. The 1952 law had not been enacted when the petitioner applied for relief from deportation in 1951\n16\n and by its terms is expressly made inapplicable to proceedings for suspension of deportation under 19 of the Immigration Act of 1917 pending, as here, on the effective date of the 1952 law.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The action was instituted pursuant to 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 243, 5 U.S.C. 1009, and the general jurisdictional provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 230, 8 U.S.C. 1329.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 130 F.

Bennett, Deputy Attorney General of California, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Edmund G. Brown, Attorney General, Arlo E. Smith, Deputy Attorney General, and Clarence A. Linn, Assistant Attorney General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOur writ of certiorari in this case was limited to the following question:\n\n\"whether, in the circumstances of this case, the state court proceedings to settle the trial transcript, upon which petitioner's automatic appeal from his conviction was necessarily heard by the Supreme Court of the State of California, in which trial court proceedings petitioner allegedly was not represented in person or by counsel designated by the state court in his behalf, resulted in denying petitioner due process of law, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\" \n353 \nU.S. 928\n.\n\n\n We believe that a mere statement of the facts in this long-drawn-out criminal litigation, material to the issue now before us, will suffice to show why we have reached the conclusion that the judgment of the Court of Appeals, affirming by a divided court\n1\n discharge of the writ of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n habeas corpus herein, must be vacated, and the case remanded for further proceedings.\n\nIn May 1948, petitioner, following a trial by jury in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, was convicted of a series of felonies under a multi-count indictment, and was sentenced to death upon two counts charging him with kidnaping for the purpose of robbery, with infliction of bodily harm, in violation of 209 of the California Penal Code. In capital cases California provides that \"an appeal is automatically taken by the defendant without any action by him or his counsel,\"\n2\n and that in such cases \"the entire record of the action shall be prepared.\"\n3\n The Supreme Court of the State of California affirmed petitioner's conviction by a divided court. 38 Cal. 2d 166, 238 P.2d 1001.\n\nAt the trial petitioner insisted upon defending himself, and repeatedly refused the trial court's offer of counsel, although he did have at his disposal the services of a deputy public defender, who acted as his \"legal adviser\" and was present at the counsel table throughout the trial. About a month after the conclusion of the trial, the official court reporter of the trial proceedings suddenly died, having at that time completed the dictation into a recording machine of what later turned out to be 646 out of 1,810 pages of the trial transcript. Following the denial of petitioner's motion in the Superior Court for a new trial,\n4\n there ensued the preparation and settlement of the trial transcript constituting the appellate record upon \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n which the California Supreme Court subsequently heard petitioner's appeal. It is the circumstances under which this transcript was prepared and settled that give rise to the issue now confronting us.\n\nAt the instance of the deputy district attorney in charge of the case, and with the approval of the trial judge, one Stanley Fraser, a court reporter and former colleague of the deceased reporter, Perry, was employed in September 1948 to transcribe the uncompleted portion of Perry's shorthand notes, amounting to 1,164 pages as finally transcribed. In November 1948 petitioner unsuccessfully sought to have the California Supreme Court halt the preparation of the transcript on the ground that Perry's notes could not be transcribed with reasonable accuracy.\n5\n Fraser accordingly went forward with the work, and was occupied with it over the next several months. A \"rough\" draft of the transcript was submitted to the trial judge in February 1949, but was not made available to petitioner, although he had requested that it be furnished him. After this draft had been gone over by the deputy district attorney, it was filed with the judge in final form on April 11, 1949, and a copy was then sent to the petitioner at San Quentin \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n Prison. Thereafter petitioner sent to the trial judge a list of some 200 corrections to the transcript, and at the same time moved that\n\n\"a hearing be ordered . . . to enable [petitioner] to determine actually the ability of Mr. Fraser to read Mr. Perry's notes, and to enable the [petitioner] to offer a showing this is not, and challenge it as, a usable transcript, and to enable [petitioner] to point out to the court the many inaccuracies and omissions in this transcript, to prove these inaccuracies and omissions, and for the court to determine these matters . . . .\"\n\n\n In these papers petitioner further stated that he had \"not yet had the opportunity to confer with his legal advisor during the trial and consequently has been hesitant to offer error in certain instances until he has verified this error with his legal advisor.\"\n\nPetitioner's motion was denied and the matter continued to proceed on an ex parte basis to final conclusion. At hearings held on June 1, 2, and 3, 1949, in which petitioner was not represented in person or by an attorney, the trial judge, after hearing Fraser's testimony as to the accuracy of his transcription and allowing some 80 of the corrections listed by petitioner, settled the record upon which petitioner's automatic appeal was to be heard. Thereafter petitioner made a motion in the California Supreme Court attacking the adequacy of these settlement proceedings, complaining, among other things, that he had not been permitted to appear at such proceedings. While that motion was pending, on August 18, 1949, a further hearing was held before the trial judge with reference to the settlement of the record, at which two witnesses were examined. Again, petitioner was not represented at this hearing either in person or by counsel. The \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 161]\n\u00a0\n sufficiency of the record, as thus settled, was upheld by the California Supreme Court, first upon the motion just mentioned, 35 Cal. 2d 455, 218 P.2d 769, and subsequently upon petitioner's appeal from his conviction, 38 Cal. 2d 166, 238 P.2d 1001.\n\nOn October 17, 1955, this Court, reversing the Court of Appeals, remanded to the District Court for a hearing petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus, charging fraud in the preparation of the state court record, which had been summarily dismissed by the District Court. \n350 \nU.S. 3\n.\n6\n This resulted in the judgment which is now before us. The District Court held that no fraud had been shown. The record of proceedings held before District Judge Goodman reveals the following additional facts as to the preparation of the state court record, none of which appear to be disputed by the State, which has been ably and conscientiously represented here: Fraser, the substitute reporter, was an uncle by marriage of the deputy district attorney in charge of this case, a fact of which neither the state trial court nor the appellate court was aware when it approved the transcript. In preparing the transcript, Fraser worked in close collaboration with the prosecutor, and also went over with two police officers, who testified for the State at the trial, his transcription of their testimony. The latter episodes were likewise unknown to the state courts when they approved the transcript. The testimony of one of these officers concerned petitioner's alleged confession, a subject of dispute at the trial, and petitioner's list of alleged inaccuracies, already mentioned, related to some of that testimony. It also appeared at this hearing that Fraser had destroyed the \"rough\" draft of his transcription \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 162]\n\u00a0\n which petitioner had sought to obtain during the settlement proceedings.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nUnder the circumstances which have been summarized, we must hold that the ex parte settlement of this state court record violated petitioner's constitutional right to procedural due process. We think the petitioner was entitled to be represented throughout those proceedings either in person or by counsel. See Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45, 68\n; Snyder v. Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 105\n; compare Dowdell v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 325, 331\n; Schwab v. Berggren, \n143 \nU.S. 442, 449\n; see also Cole v. Arkansas, \n333 \nU.S. 196, 201\n. If California chose to deny petitioner's request to appear in those proceedings in propria persona, it then became incumbent on the State to appoint counsel for him. Cf. Powell v. Alabama, supra. We cannot agree that petitioner's refusal to be represented by counsel at the trial constituted a waiver of his right to counsel at the settlement proceedings.\n8\n Moreover, it is at least doubtful whether, as a matter of due process, any such waiver would be effective to relieve the trial judge of a duty to appoint counsel for petitioner in connection with the settlement of this record, which was a necessary\n9\n and integral part \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 163]\n\u00a0\n of the compulsory appeal provided by California in capital cases.\n10\n We need not decide that question, however, for the record fails to show that petitioner ever waived his right to counsel in connection with the settlement of the appellate record.\n\nNor can we regard the hearings before Judge Goodman, at which petitioner was both represented by counsel and personally present, as curing the lack of procedural due process in the state proceedings. Judge Goodman considered that our order of October 17, 1955, restricted the inquiry before him to the issue of whether the settlement of the state court record had been tainted by fraud, and that the accuracy of the record, as such, was not an issue in this proceeding.\n11\n We accept fully Judge Goodman's \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 164]\n\u00a0\n finding that there was no fraud. Even so, the fact remains that the petitioner has never had his day in court upon the controversial issues of fact and law involved in the settlement of the record upon which his conviction was affirmed.\n\nBy no means are we to be understood as saying that the state record has been shown to be inaccurate or incomplete. All we hold is that, consistently with procedural due process, California's affirmance of petitioner's conviction upon a seriously disputed record, whose accuracy petitioner has had no voice in determining, cannot be allowed to stand.\n12\n Without blinking the fact that the history of this case presents a sorry chapter in the annals of delays in the administration of criminal justice,\n13\n we cannot allow that circumstance to deter us from withholding \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 165]\n\u00a0\n relief so clearly called for.\n14\n On many occasions this Court has found it necessary to say that the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment must be respected, no matter how heinous the crime in question and no matter how guilty an accused may ultimately be found to be after guilt has been established in accordance with the procedure demanded by the Constitution. Evidently it also needs to be repeated that the overriding responsibility of this Court is to the Constitution of the United States, no matter how late it may be that a violation of the Constitution is found to exist. This Court may not disregard the Constitution because an appeal in this case, as in others, has been made on the eve of execution. We must be deaf to all suggestions that a valid appeal to the Constitution, even by a guilty man, comes too late, because courts, including this Court, were not earlier able to enforce what the Constitution demands. The proponent before the Court is not the petitioner but the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe have given careful consideration to the nature of the relief to be granted. Petitioner's discharge is not to be ordered without affording California an opportunity to review his conviction upon a record the sufficiency of which has been litigated in proceedings satisfying the requirements of procedural due process. Nor do we think it will do simply to remand the case to the District Court for an inquiry into the accuracy of the record upon which the California Supreme Court has already acted. The task of affording petitioner a further review of his conviction upon a properly settled record is necessarily one for the state courts. A federal court \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 166]\n\u00a0\n is in no such position as the state courts are to determine what inaccuracies or other facts might be decisive under state law, particularly in view of the unusual character of the issues here involved. We conclude, therefore, that our proper course is to vacate the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the District Court and to remand the case to the District Court, with instructions to enter such orders as may be appropriate to allow California a reasonable time within which to take further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, failing which the petitioner shall be discharged. Cf. Dowd v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 206, 209\n-210.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON dissents because he believes that, upon consideration of all the circumstances of this case, the State of California has accorded to this petitioner due process of law within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States.\n\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 239 F.2d 205.

The California Penal Code, however, contains no comparable provision.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] On September 16, 1948, when the appointment of the substitute stenographer was under consideration, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Los Angeles Superior Court Reporters' Association wrote the Board of Supervisors respecting the matter, as follows: \"We believe the purported charge against the county is not only an exorbitant one per se, but will reflect further adverse publicity upon our group because we have serious doubts that any reporter will be able to furnish a usable transcript of said shorthand notes. Other reporters of our number have examined and studied Mr. Perry's notes and have reached the conclusion that many portions of the same will be found completely indecipherable because, toward the latter part of each court session, Mr. Perry's notes show his illness. We feel that this should be brought to your attention.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] On five previous occasions, this Court had denied petitions for certiorari filed by this petitioner. See note 13, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Petitioner alleges that there were other relevant circumstances that should have been explored in the state settlement proceedings, but could not, he asserts, be proved in the hearings before Judge Goodman because of inability to secure records and the attendance of witnesses from outside the Northern District of California.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The following statement of the petitioner at the trial, quoted in the State's present brief, hardly supports the claim of such a continuing waiver: \"I wish to point out that it is my intention . . . at this time [to represent myself] and to continue to do so until such time as it is legally established that I am not qualified to do so, and that I will not accept a court-appointed attorney.\" See Johnson v.

In granting a certificate of probable cause for appeal to the Court of Appeals in the present proceeding, Chief \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 163]\n\u00a0\n Judge Denman noted: \"How important the California law regards this transcription [of the trial proceedings] and certification [as to its correctness] by the reporter is apparent from the fact that in civil cases the death of the reporter before his transcription and certification, gives the trial court the discretionary power to set aside the judgment and order a new trial. California Code of Civil Procedure, 953e. By some quirk in California legislation this does not apply to criminal cases. However, it is obvious that if the reporter's transcript is so important as to give the court such power in a civil case, a fortiori it must have such importance in a criminal case in which, on the evidence to be transcribed, the accused is sentenced to death. Likewise its importance is emphasized by the California law making the appeal automatic from death sentences. California Penal Code, 1239 (b).\" In re Chessman, 219 F.2d 162, 164.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See note 2, supra. Counsel for the petitioner, whose representations in this regard were not challenged by the State, informed us on the oral argument that the California Supreme Court customarily appoints counsel for the defendant when he is not otherwise represented by counsel on an automatic appeal.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Judge Goodman did state, however, that he found petitioner's claims with respect to certain alleged prejudicial comments by the trial judge and the prosecutor to be without foundation. In the context of the limited issue with which the judge was here concerned, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 164]\n\u00a0\n we should be slow to regard these \"findings\" as possessing the same conclusiveness as if they had been made in a proceeding where the accuracy of the record, as such, was in issue.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] In view of our holding we cannot regard ourselves as concluded by the California Supreme Court's holdings that the record on which it acted was adequate as a matter of state law, and that, in any event, the inaccuracies then claimed by the petitioner would not have changed the result of his appeal. Petitioner is entitled to have his conviction reviewed upon a record which has been settled in accordance with procedural due process. Moreover, in holding as it did the state court was not aware of the facts later developed in hearings before Judge Goodman, see p. 161, supra, and we cannot know that those facts, and others that might be disclosed upon an adversary hearing focused squarely on the adequacy of the transcript, would not lead it to a different conclusion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Certainly this Court's previous denials of certiorari, \n340 \nU.S. 840\n; \n341 \nU.S. 929\n; \n343 \nU.S. 915\n; \n346 \nU.S. 916\n; \n348 \nU.S. 864\n, do not foreclose us from now granting appropriate relief. Brown v. Allen, \n344 \nU.S. 443\n. And it may be noted that it was not until the present proceedings in the District Court that the facts surrounding the settlement of the state court record were fully developed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] In Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n, this Court did not hesitate to deal with a claimed denial of constitutional rights some 18 years after the petitioner had been convicted in a state court. See also Price v. Johnston, \n334 \nU.S. 266, 291\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK concurs, dissenting.\n\nI agree with the general principle announced by the Court. But I think it is misapplied here. Its application to the facts results, I fear, in a needless detour in a case already long-drawn-out by many appeals.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nI agree that in a case like this it matters not whether the petitioner is guilty or innocent, whether his complaint is timely or tardy. We should respect a man's constitutional right whenever or however it is presented to us. My difficulty here is not with any principle the Court \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 167]\n\u00a0\n announces. My dissent is based on the conviction that, in substance, the requirements of due process have been fully satisfied, that to require more is to exalt a technicality.\n\nTo say that the settlement in this case was ex parte is to be technically accurate. But it is not to state the whole story. Chessman was not present in court when the record was settled. Nor was he represented there by a lawyer, for he had over and again refused to allow a state-appointed lawyer to represent him. Chessman, however, played an active role in the process of the settlement of the record. The early draft prepared by Fraser, the new reporter, was sent to him for his suggestions. That Chessman went over this draft with a fine-tooth comb is evident from a reading of 200-odd corrections which he prepared. Of these proposals, about 80 were adopted and the rest refused.\n2\n Some of these proposals were specific, calling the court's attention to the use of a wrong word or phrase. Many were not specific. Some merely said that the reported version of certain testimony was garbled or incomplete or inaccurate. These generalized criticisms were never made specific. When Chessman made a generalized criticism, not once did he indicate such and such a fact had been omitted and prejudice shown, how an episode had been distorted and prejudice shown, where a date or name had been confused and prejudice shown, in what material respect an account was garbled and prejudice shown. Errors might have been made that were minor and inconsequential or major and fatal. From all that Chessman said to the California courts and from all he now says to this Court, it is impossible to conclude that there is any important, significant prejudicial error in the record on which the appeal in this case was taken. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 168]\n\u00a0\n Certainly we are pointed to none. Only vague assertions are made. Not once is a finger placed on a crucial issue of the case and a showing made or attempted that on that issue the facts were distorted to Chessman's prejudice. The conclusion is irresistible that Chessman is playing a game with the courts, stalling for time while the facts of the case grow cold.\n\nMuch time is given to the fact that Fraser, the substitute reporter, was related to the prosecutor and to the fact that Fraser, in reconstructing the record, talked with several witnesses for the State. Those circumstances conceivably could give rise to prejudice. Yet not once does Chessman say in what way the words of a witness on a critical issue are distorted so as to cause prejudice to Chessman's appeal. We know that there was no connivance between the prosecutor and the substitute reporter, for such was the finding of the District Court. Chessman v. Teets, 138 F. Supp. 761. And those findings are not subject to challenge, as we limited our grant of certiorari. What we are told - and all that we are told - is that Chessman should have been present in person or by an attorney at the hearing where the record was settled. Error is presumed because he was not present nor represented. But we should presume just the contrary, since Chessman had the opportunity to submit his version and indicate any errors in the reconstructed record and yet came up with no single omission, distortion, falsification, mistake, or error that could reasonably be said to be prejudicial.\n\nA good illustration concerns the main issue on the appeal - the so-called confession obtained from Chessman. The confession was held admissible by the Supreme Court of California. People v. Chessman, 38 Cal. 2d 166, 178-182, 238 P.2d 1001, 1008-1011. That was the main point in the petition for certiorari brought here \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 169]\n\u00a0\n in the 1951 Term. It presented the problem of the effect of prolonged detention by the police on the voluntary character of the confession, the type of problem presented in Haley v. Ohio, \n332 \nU.S. 596\n; Watts v. Indiana, \n338 \nU.S. 49\n; Turner v. Pennsylvania, \n338 \nU.S. 62\n; and Harris v. South Carolina, \n338 \nU.S. 68\n. The Court denied certiorari. Chessman v. California, \n343 \nU.S. 915\n.\n\nIn that petition Chessman claimed what he claims now - that he should have had a hearing on the settlement of the record. And he asserted that, if the transcript had been wholly accurate, it would be obvious that the confession was involuntary, while on the reconstructed record the question was more debatable.\n\nThe reconstructed record shows that Chessman was held incommunicado about 72 hours by the police before arraignment. During this time he was beaten to some extent. During this time he was interrogated off and on by the police. Only when he had made an oral confession was he arraigned. Not once in the earlier petition or in the present one or in any other motion paper did Chessman rebut the accuracy of the facts stated in the reconstructed record. He did not, for example, allege he was held longer than 72 hours. He did not say he was beaten more often or more severely than the reconstructed record shows. He did not assert that he was interrogated for longer periods or subjected to a greater ordeal than the reconstructed record states. Yet certainly he knows whether he was or whether he was not.\n\nHe advances no fact, no assertion, no evidence to show that on this critical issue in the case - and in my mind the most important one - the reconstructed record is distorted. I would presume accuracy, not error, in any record from any court. I would insist that this defendant make some showing of inaccuracy in a material way before I would send this record back for further reconstruction. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 170]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOnly once during the long history of this case has Chessman pointed specifically to material inaccuracy or omission in the transcript. His charge of fraud, now set to rest by the findings of the District Court, was predicated upon a conspiracy to have expunged from the record certain specific remarks and instructions of the trial court. These omissions had not been mentioned in the long list of inaccuracies which Chessman submitted to the California courts. And, on these contentions, Chessman has now been given a hearing by the District Court, which found:\n\n \"8. The instructions given by the trial judge to the jury on May 21, 1948 were correctly and accurately reported in the transcript as prepared by Fraser. The trial judge did not instruct the jury at that time as alleged and testified to by petitioner. Petitioner's statements in this regard are false and perjurious.\n\n\n \"9. The allegation in the petition that the trial judge stated to the jury on May 21, when instructing them, that `this defendant is one of the worse [sic] criminals I have had in my court' is false and perjurious. The trial judge made no such statement. Hence the transcript was correct in not including such statement.\" 138 F. Supp., at 765-766.\n\n\n To repeat, this is not a case of a helpless man who was given no opportunity to participate in the settlement of the record. He did participate in a real, vivid sense of the term. A lawyer who entered the case by appointment at this late stage would be utterly helpless, for he would have no idea what went on at the trial. When it came to the settlement of the record, California did all that reasonably could be required by sending the reconstructed record to Chessman for criticism. His \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 171]\n\u00a0\n specific criticisms were often accepted.\n3\n His general criticisms were not.\n4\n Since it was in his power to make the general criticisms specific, he was given that opportunity which due process of law requires. Yet he declined over and again to make the general criticisms specific, asking only that he be present at the hearing.\n\nThe habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts has been greatly under fire in recent years. I for one would hate to see it abolished or greatly curtailed by Congress. It has done high service in the administration of justice. Not uncommonly a case that is here on certiorari from a state court presents only darkly or obliquely an important constitutional issue. Perhaps, as in Massey v. Moore, \n348 \nU.S. 105\n, the issue could not be raised at the trial. Perhaps the trial lawyer failed to present it clearly. Perhaps only after the trial were the full facts known. Perhaps the issue was poorly focused in the trial court's charge. On habeas corpus the facts can be fully \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 172]\n\u00a0\n developed; and perhaps only then can the basic constitutional defect be laid bare. Such, for example, was the situation in Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86\n; Wade v. Mayo, \n334 \nU.S. 672\n; and Leyra v. Denno, \n347 \nU.S. 556\n, where miscarriages of justice were prevented only through the writ of habeas corpus. And see Pollak, Proposals to Curtail Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners: Collateral Attack on the Great Writ, 66 Yale L. J. 50.\n\nBut the fragile grounds upon which the present decision rests jeopardize the ancient writ for use by federal courts in state prosecutions. The present decision states in theory the ideal of due process. But the facts of this case cry out against its application here. Chessman has received due process over and again. He has had repeated reviews of every point in his case. The question of the adequacy of the reconstructed record has been here seven times. The question of Chessman's right to participate in the settlement proceedings has been here at least four times.\n5\n Not once before now did a single Justice vote to grant certiorari on that issue. If the failure to let Chessman, or a lawyer acting for him, participate in the hearing on the settlement of the record went to jurisdiction\n6\n (as it must for habeas corpus to issue), then we should have granted certiorari when the Supreme Court of California first held in People v. Chessman, 35 Cal. 2d 455, 218 P.2d 769, that the reconstructed record was a proper record for appeal. That decision of the California Supreme Court was announced May 19, 1950. We denied certiorari on October 9, 1950. Chessman v. California, \n340 \nU.S. 840\n. Nearly seven years later we return to precisely the same issue and not only grant certiorari but order relief by way of habeas corpus. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 173]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn Chessman's first appeal, Justice Carter and Justice Edmonds dissented from the decision of the California Supreme Court, stating that in their view the necessity to use a reconstructed record in a capital case required a new trial. 35 Cal. 2d 455, 468-473, 218 P.2d 769, 776-780. That view to me makes sense as a matter of state law. But the Court today makes no such ruling. To order, after this long delay, a new record seems to me a futility. It must be remembered that Chessman was convicted on May 21, 1948 - over nine years ago. It is difficult to see how, after that long lapse of time, the memory of any participant (if he is still alive) would be sharp enough to make any hearing meaningful. We meddle mischievously with the law when we issue the writ today. We do not act to remedy any injustice that has been demonstrated. When the whole history of the case is considered, we seize upon a technicality to undo what has been repeatedly sustained both by the California Supreme Court and by this Court. I would guard the ancient writ jealously, using it only to prevent a gross miscarriage of justice.\n\n  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n\n\n Before his appeal was heard by the California Supreme Court, Chessman moved in that court for orders augmenting and correcting the record, and for a dismissal of his automatic appeal. On May 19, 1950, the California Supreme Court granted the motion for augmentation of the record, insofar as it sought to have added to the transcript the voir dire examination of jurors and the prosecutor's opening statement. Further relief was denied. People v. Chessman, 35 Cal. 2d 455, 218 P.2d 769. On June 12, 1950, that court denied a petition for a writ of habeas corpus without hearing or opinion. Chessman's \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 174]\n\u00a0\n petition for a writ of certiorari to review that decision was filed in this Court on July 31, 1950. No. 98, Misc., 1950 Term. In the petition, Chessman urged that he had been denied due process because he was not present at the hearing in which the trial judge considered objections to the transcript. Certiorari was denied on October 9, 1950. Chessman v. California, \n340 \nU.S. 840\n.\n\nChessman then petitioned the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for a writ of habeas corpus and equitable relief. On December 4, 1950, the District Court discharged its order to show cause and dismissed the petition. On December 27, 1950, the District Court denied Chessman leave to appeal in forma pauperis, and, on January 9, 1951, denied a certificate of probable cause. On February 27, 1951, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied a petition for a certificate of probable cause and for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. On April 2, 1951, Chessman petitioned for a writ of certiorari to review that decision of the Court of Appeals, and for leave to file a petition for habeas corpus. No. 442, Misc., 1950 term. In this Court, Chessman contended that the state court should be enjoined from deciding his pending appeal until it granted him a full hearing on the question of the adequacy of the record. Certiorari and the motion for leave to file petition for writ of habeas corpus were denied on May 14, 1951. Chessman v. California, \n341 \nU.S. 929\n.\n\nThe California Supreme Court affirmed Chessman's conviction on December 18, 1951. People v. Chessman, 38 Cal. 2d 166, 238 P.2d 1001. Chessman filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on February 20, 1952. No. 371, Misc., 1951 Term. In this Court, he claimed that he had been denied due process because of the manner in which the record was prepared and particularly because he had been denied an opportunity to prove his factual contentions as to the inaccuracy of the transcript. It was also \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 175]\n\u00a0\n contended that he had been denied the opportunity to prepare for trial, that the confession introduced against him was coerced, that the prosecution had unfairly presented its case, that his defense had been unreasonably hampered at the trial, and that the statute under which he was sentenced to death was unconstitutional. Certiorari was denied on March 31, 1952. Chessman v. California, \n343 \nU.S. 915\n. Rehearing was denied on April 28, 1952. \n343 \nU.S. 937\n.\n\nOn May 19, 1952, Chessman filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The District Court denied the petition without hearing on June 9, 1952. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed that decision on May 28, 1953. Chessman v. People, 205 F.2d 128. Petition for a writ of certiorari was filed November 9, 1953. No. 239, Misc., 1953 Term. Here, Chessman contended that he was entitled to a hearing on his contentions in the courts below that he was forced to go to trial unprepared, that coerced confessions had been introduced into evidence against him, that the prosecution and judge were guilty of misconduct. It was alleged that some of these matters could not have been properly determined by the California Supreme Court because of inadequacies in the record, which, it was alleged, had been fraudulently prepared without giving him the opportunity to prove the inaccuracy or fraud. Certiorari was denied on December 14, 1953. Chessman v. California, \n346 \nU.S. 916\n. Rehearing was denied on February 1, 1954. \n347 \nU.S. 908\n.\n\nOn July 16, 1954, Chessman filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of California. That petition was denied July 21, 1954, without written opinion. (Collateral proceedings are: In re Chessman, 43 Cal. 2d 296, 273 P.2d 263; In re Chessman, 43 Cal. 2d 391, 274 P.2d 645; In re Chessman, 43 Cal. 2d 408, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 176]\n\u00a0\n 274 P.2d 645, 655.) Chessman's petition for a writ of certiorari was filed August 14, 1954. No. 285, 1954 Term. He contended that the trial transcript had been fraudulently prepared by the prosecutor, reporter and trial judge. On October 25, 1954, certiorari was denied \"without prejudice to an application for a writ of habeas corpus in an appropriate United States District Court.\" Chessman v. California, \n348 \nU.S. 864\n.\n\nChessman applied to the United States District Court for the Northern Division of California for a writ of habeas corpus on December 30, 1954. The District Court dismissed the petition without a hearing on January 4, 1955. In re Chessman, 128 F. Supp. 600. On January 11, 1955, Chief Judge Denman of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a certificate of probable cause for appeal. Application of Chessman, 219 F.2d 162. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, on April 7, 1955, affirmed the District Court decision. Chessman v. Teets, 221 F.2d 276. Petition for a writ of certiorari was filed June 30, 1955. No. 196, 1955 Term. It was alleged that prejudicial statements of the trial judge at the trial had been deleted from the transcript as a result of a fraudulent conspiracy between the prosecuting attorney and the court reporter. It was also alleged that Chessman's right to be present at the \"vital stage of the proceedings\" to settle the record had been \"summarily ignored.\" On October 17, 1955, certiorari was granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed, and the case remanded to the District Court for a hearing on Chessman's allegations of fraud. Chessman v. Teets, \n350 \nU.S. 3\n.\n\nHearings were ordered in the District Court, commencing January 9, 1956. Hearings were commenced on January 16, after Chessman was granted two continuances. The hearing lasted 7 days. Finding that there had been no fraud, and that the trial judge's statements \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 177]\n\u00a0\n and instructions to the jury had been accurately reported, the District Court discharged the writ on January 31, 1956. Chessman v. Teets, 138 F. Supp. 761. The Court of Appeals affirmed on October 18, 1956. Chessman v. Teets, 239 F.2d 205. Rehearing was denied on November 20, 1956. Chessman's seventh petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on February 1, 1957. No. 566, Misc., 1956 Term.\n*\n We granted certiorari, limiting it to the question whether Chessman's failure to be represented in person or by counsel at the settlement proceedings deprived him of due process of law, thus excluding review on the issue of fraud. See \n353 \nU.S. 928\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Other reported proceedings in connection with Chessman's case are as follows: People v. Superior Court and In re Chessman, 273 P.2d 936 (Cal. Dist. Ct. of App. 1954); In re Chessman and People v. Superior Court, 44 Cal. 2d 1, 279 P.2d 24 (1955). And see the opinion of Judge Hamley, below. 239 F.2d 209-210, n. 2.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See the Appendix to this opinion, post, p. 173.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] These include many that relate to the crime of burglary, of which he was acquitted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The trial judge resolved doubts in favor of the defendant. Thus he ruled \"The amendment . . . is ordered as suggested by the appellant, not because the Court has any recollection of that but to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt in the matter.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] A typical ruling by the trial court on a general objection is as follows: \"Going over then to \n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 1048]\n\u00a0\n, Lines 4 to 10, defendant makes no suggestion as to what ought to go in there. A check with the shorthand notes indicates that the transcription is correct. The objection is overruled.\" Occasionally the trial judge ruled as follows on an objection that was cast in general terms: \"\n\n[354 \nU.S. 156, 866]\n\u00a0\n, nothing being pointed out which would be any assistance to the Court in amending the transcript, the amendment is disallowed. However, this again happens to be one of those instances in which the testimony and the manner in which it was given impressed themselves strongly on my mind, and I am quite satisfied that that is a verbatim transcription of that portion of the testimony and is not inaccurate as asserted.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See the Appendix to this opinion, post, p. 173.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Johnson v.

On a motion to quash on the grounds, inter alia, that the subpoenas were vague, excessively broad in scope, and oppressive, both the Hearing Examiner and the Board found that the subpoenas described the documents to be produced with sufficient particularity, were reasonable in scope, and were not oppressive. Upon respondents' continued refusal to honor the subpoenas, petitioner filed this enforcement proceeding. Initially the trial judge continued the cause for 10 days \"on condition that respondents . . . make the documents specified in the administrative subpenas . . . available immediately to the representatives of the Civil Aeronautics Board for examination and copying at the usual places of business of the named respondents . . . .\" Upon the expiration of this period, the court, on a showing that respondents had not complied with this condition, entered an order of enforcement allowing \"a sufficient length of time between dates for the production of the documents . . . so that the respondents will not be deprived of all of their books and records at the same time.\" The court found that it could not say \"that any of the documents or things called for in any of the subpoenas are immaterial or irrelevant to the proceedings before the Board . . .\" without an examination of each of the items ordered produced. The Court of Appeals reversed, establishing certain procedural requirements the Board must follow before an enforcement proceeding is in order. 237 F.2d 359.\n\nAs we read the order of the District Court, it duly enforced the Board's right to call for documents relevant to the issues of the Board's complaint, with appropriate provisions for assuring the minimum interference with the conduct of the business of respondents. The judgment \n\n[353 \nU.S. 322, 324]\n\u00a0\n of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with instructions to reinstate its enforcement order of May 16, 1955. See 1004 (b), Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1021, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 644 (b); Brown v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 134, 142\n-143 (1928); Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, \n327 \nU.S. 186\n (1946); Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, \n317 \nU.S. 501, 509\n (1943). Of course this enforcement order leaves open to the respondents ample opportunities for objecting, on relevant grounds, to the admissibility into evidence of any particular document.\n\n     It is so ordered. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONLEY v. GIBSON(1957)\nNo. 28\nArgued: October 21, 1957Decided: November 18, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioners, who are Negro members of a union designated as their bargaining agent under the Railway Labor Act, brought a class suit against the union, its brotherhood and certain of their officers to compel them to represent petitioners without discrimination in protection of their employment and seniority rights under a contract between the union and the Railroad. They alleged that the Railroad had purported to abolish 45 jobs held by petitioners and other Negroes but had employed whites in the same jobs (except in a few instances in which it had rehired Negroes to fill their old jobs with loss of seniority) and that, despite repeated pleas, the union had done nothing to protect petitioners from such discriminatory discharges. The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the National Railroad Adjustment Board had exclusive jurisdiction over the controversy. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:\n\n 1. It was error to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction. Section 3 First (i) of the Railway Labor Act confers upon the Adjustment Board exclusive jurisdiction only over \"disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers,\" whereas this is a suit by employees against their bargaining agent to enforce their statutory right not to be discriminated against by it in bargaining. Pp. 44-45.\n\n\n 2. The Railroad was not an indispensable party to this suit, and failure to join it was not a ground for dismissing the suit. P. 45.\n\n\n 3. The complaint adequately set forth a claim upon which relief could be granted. Pp. 45-48.\n\n\n  (a) The fact that, under the Railway Labor Act, aggrieved employees can file their own grievances with the Adjustment Board or sue the employer for breach of contract is no justification for the union's alleged discrimination in refusing to represent petitioners. P. 47.\n\n\n  (b) Failure of the complaint to set forth specific facts to support its general allegations of discrimination was not a sufficient \n\n[355 \nU.S. 41, 42]\n\u00a0\n ground for dismissal of the suit, since the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require a claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim. Pp. 47-48.\n\n\n 229 F.2d 436, reversed.\n\nJoseph C. Waddy argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief were Roberson L. King, Robert L. Carter, William C. Gardner and William B. Bryant.\n\nEdward J. Hickey, Jr. argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was Clarence M. Mulholland.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOnce again Negro employees are here under the Railway Labor Act\n1\n asking that their collective bargaining agent be compelled to represent them fairly. In a series of cases beginning with Steele v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n323 \nU.S. 192\n, this Court has emphatically and repeatedly ruled that an exclusive bargaining agent under the Railway Labor Act is obligated to represent all employees in the bargaining unit fairly and without discrimination because of race and has held that the courts have power to protect employees against such invidious discrimination.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThis class suit was brought in a Federal District Court in Texas by certain Negro members of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, petitioners here, on behalf of themselves and other Negro employees similarly situated against the Brotherhood, its Local Union No. 28 and certain officers of both. In summary, the complaint \n\n[355 \nU.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n made the following allegations relevant to our decision: Petitioners were employees of the Texas and New Orleans Railroad at its Houston Freight House. Local 28 of the Brotherhood was the designated bargaining agent under the Railway Labor Act for the bargaining unit to which petitioners belonged. A contract existed between the Union and the Railroad which gave the employees in the bargaining unit certain protection from discharge and loss of seniority. In May 1954, the Railroad purported to abolish 45 jobs held by petitioners or other Negroes all of whom were either discharged or demoted. In truth the 45 jobs were not abolished at all but instead filled by whites as the Negroes were ousted, except for a few instances where Negroes were rehired to fill their old jobs but with loss of seniority. Despite repeated pleas by petitioners, the Union, acting according to plan, did nothing to protect them against these discriminatory discharges and refused to give them protection comparable to that given white employees. The complaint then went on to allege that the Union had failed in general to represent Negro employees equally and in good faith. It charged that such discrimination constituted a violation of petitioners' right under the Railway Labor Act to fair representation from their bargaining agent. And it concluded by asking for relief in the nature of declaratory judgment, injunction and damages.\n\nThe respondents appeared and moved to dismiss the complaint on several grounds: (1) the National Railroad Adjustment Board had exclusive jurisdiction over the controversy; (2) the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, which had not been joined, was an indispensable party defendant; and (3) the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be given. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss holding that Congress had given the Adjustment Board exclusive jurisdiction over \n\n[355 \nU.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n the controversy. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, apparently relying on the same ground, affirmed. 229 F.2d 436. Since the case raised an important question concerning the protection of employee rights under the Railway Labor Act we granted certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 818\n.\n\nWe hold that it was error for the courts below to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. They took the position that 3 First (i) of the Railway Labor Act conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the Adjustment Board because the case, in their view, involved the interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement. But 3 First (i) by its own terms applies only to \"disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers.\"\n3\n This case involves no dispute between employee and employer but to the contrary is a suit by employees against the bargaining agent to enforce their statutory right not to be unfairly discriminated against by it in bargaining.\n4\n The Adjustment Board has no \n\n[355 \nU.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n power under 3 First (i) or any other provision of the Act to protect them from such discrimination. Furthermore, the contract between the Brotherhood and the Railroad will be, at most, only incidentally involved in resolving this controversy between petitioners and their bargaining agent.\n\nAlthough the District Court did not pass on the other reasons advanced for dismissal of the complaint we think it timely and proper for us to consider them here. They have been briefed and argued by both parties and the respondents urge that the decision below be upheld, if necessary, on these other grounds.\n\nAs in the courts below, respondents contend that the Texas and New Orleans Railroad Company is an indispensable party which the petitioners have failed to join as a defendant. On the basis of the allegations made in the complaint and the relief demanded by petitioners we believe that contention is unjustifiable. We cannot see how the Railroad's rights or interests will be affected by this action to enforce the duty of the bargaining representative to represent petitioners fairly. This is not a suit, directly or indirectly, against the Railroad. No relief is asked from it and there is no prospect that any will or can be granted which will bind it. If an issue does develop which necessitates joining the Railroad either it or the respondents will then have an adequate opportunity to request joinder.\n\nTurning to respondents' final ground, we hold that under the general principles laid down in the Steele, Graham, and Howard cases the complaint adequately set forth a claim upon which relief could be granted. In appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of course, the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts \n\n[355 \nU.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\n5\n Here, the complaint alleged, in part, that petitioners were discharged wrongfully by the Railroad and that the Union, acting according to plan, refused to protect their jobs as it did those of white employees or to help them with their grievances all because they were Negroes. If these allegations are proven there has been a manifest breach of the Union's statutory duty to represent fairly and without hostile discrimination all of the employees in the bargaining unit. This Court squarely held in Steele and subsequent cases that discrimination in representation because of race is prohibited by the Railway Labor Act. The bargaining representative's duty not to draw \"irrelevant and invidious\"\n6\n distinctions among those it represents does not come to an abrupt end, as the respondents seem to contend, with the making of an agreement between union and employer. Collective bargaining is a continuing process. Among other things, it involves day-to-day adjustments in the contract and other working rules, resolution of new problems not covered by existing agreements, and the protection of employee rights already secured by contract. The bargaining representative can no more unfairly discriminate in carrying out these functions than it can in negotiating a collective agreement.\n7\n A contract may be fair and impartial on its face yet administered in such a way, with the active or tacit consent of the union, as to be flagrantly discriminatory against some members of the bargaining unit. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 41, 47]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe respondents point to the fact that under the Railway Labor Act aggrieved employees can file their own grievances with the Adjustment Board or sue the employer for breach of contract. Granting this, it still furnishes no sanction for the Union's alleged discrimination in refusing to represent petitioners. The Railway Labor Act, in an attempt to aid collective action by employees, conferred great power and protection on the bargaining agent chosen by a majority of them. As individuals or small groups the employees cannot begin to possess the bargaining power of their representative in negotiating with the employer or in presenting their grievances to him. Nor may a minority choose another agent to bargain in their behalf. We need not pass on the Union's claim that it was not obliged to handle any grievances at all because we are clear that once it undertook to bargain or present grievances for some of the employees it represented it could not refuse to take similar action in good faith for other employees just because they were Negroes.\n\nThe respondents also argue that the complaint failed to set forth specific facts to support its general allegations of discrimination and that its dismissal is therefore proper. The decisive answer to this is that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require a claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim. To the contrary, all the Rules require is \"a short and plain statement of the claim\"\n8\n that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests. The illustrative forms appended to the Rules plainly demonstrate this. Such simplified \"notice pleading\" is made possible by the liberal opportunity for discovery and the other pretrial procedures \n\n[355 \nU.S. 41, 48]\n\u00a0\n established by the Rules to disclose more precisely the basis of both claim and defense and to define more narrowly the disputed facts and issues.\n9\n Following the simple guide of Rule 8 (f) that \"all pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice,\" we have no doubt that petitioners' complaint adequately set forth a claim and gave the respondents fair notice of its basis. The Federal Rules reject the approach that pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome and accept the principle that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.

Greenberg.\n\nBeatrice Rosenberg argued the cause for the United States. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney and Carl H. Imlay.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe issue in this case is whether the custodian of a union's books and records may, on the ground of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, refuse to \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 119]\n\u00a0\n answer questions asked by a federal grand jury as to the whereabouts of such books and records which he has not produced pursuant to subpoena. For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that the privilege against self-incrimination attaches to such questions.\n\nIn April 1956, a special grand jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York was investigating racketeering in the garment and trucking industries in New York City. This investigation followed widespread charges of racketeering in labor unions, including specific charges that seven local unions had been recently chartered by a faction of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to gain control of the Teamsters' New York Joint Council, and that these \"phantom unions\" were controlled by a group of gangsters, ex-convicts and labor racketeers.\n\nPetitioner, Joseph Curcio, the secretary-treasurer of Local 269 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the alleged \"phantom unions,\" was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury, and to produce the union's books and records. There were two subpoenas - a personal subpoena ad testificandum and a subpoena duces tecum addressed to him in his capacity as secretary-treasurer of Local 269. On several days he appeared before the grand jury but failed to produce the demanded books and records. He testified that he was the secretary-treasurer of Local 269; that the union had books and records; but that they were not then in his possession. He refused, on the ground of self-incrimination, to answer any questions pertaining to the whereabouts, or who had possession, of the books and records he had been ordered to produce.\n\nThe District Court, after a hearing in which petitioner attempted to justify his claim of privilege, directed petitioner to answer 15 questions pertaining to the whereabouts \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 120]\n\u00a0\n of the books and records.\n1\n It ruled that petitioner's claim of privilege was improper because he had not made a sufficient showing that his answers might \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 121]\n\u00a0\n incriminate him. When petitioner persisted in his refusal to answer, the District Court summarily adjudged him guilty of criminal contempt, and sentenced him to six months' confinement unless he sooner purged himself by answering the questions. This conviction related solely to petitioner's failure to answer questions asked pursuant to the personal subpoena ad testificandum. He has not been charged with failing to produce the books and records demanded in the subpoena duces tecum.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. 234 F.2d 470. It held that petitioner had failed to show that his answers to the 15 questions might incriminate him; that the privilege against self-incrimination did not attach to questions put to a custodian relating to the whereabouts of union books; and that petitioner had been accorded a fair hearing. We granted certiorari to determine whether petitioner's claim of privilege was properly denied. \n352 \nU.S. 820\n.\n\nIn the courts below, the Government contended that petitioner had not made a sufficient showing that answering the 15 questions might tend to incriminate him. The Government no longer so contends. In its brief it now says, \"We make no claim that, if petitioner's personal privilege did apply to questions concerning the union records, he failed to make an adequate showing of possible incrimination.\" There is substantial ground for the Government's concession.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 122]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe turn, therefore, to the remaining issue - whether petitioner's personal privilege against self-incrimination attaches to questions relating to the whereabouts of the union books and records which he did not produce pursuant to subpoena.\n\nIt is settled that a corporation is not protected by the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. A corporate officer may not withhold testimony or documents on the ground that his corporation would be incriminated. Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n. Nor may the custodian of corporate books or records withhold them on the ground that he personally might be incriminated by their production. Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361\n; Essgee Co. v. United States, \n262 \nU.S. 151\n. Even after the dissolution of a corporation and the transfer of its books to individual stockholders, the transferees may not invoke their privilege with respect to the former corporate records. Grant v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 74\n; Wheeler v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 478\n. The foregoing cases stand for the principle that the books and records of corporations cannot be insulated from reasonable demands of governmental authorities by a claim of personal privilege on the part of their custodian.\n\nIn United States v. White, \n322 \nU.S. 694\n, this principle was applied to an unincorporated association, a labor union. Stating that the privilege against self-incrimination had the historic function of \"protecting only the natural individual from compulsory incrimination through his own testimony or personal records\" (id., at 701), the Court held that \"the papers and effects which \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 123]\n\u00a0\n the privilege protects must be the private property of the person claiming the privilege, or at least in his possession in a purely personal capacity\" (id., at 699).\n\n\"But individuals, when acting as representatives of a collective group, cannot be said to be exercising their personal rights and duties nor to be entitled to their purely personal privileges. Rather they assume the rights, duties and privileges of the artificial entity or association of which they are agents or officers and they are bound by its obligations. In their official capacity, therefore, they have no privilege against self-incrimination. And the official records and documents of the organization that are held by them in a representative rather than in a personal capacity cannot be the subject of the personal privilege against self-incrimination, even though production of the papers might tend to incriminate them personally.\" Id., at 699.\n\n\n The Government now contends that the representative duty which required the production of union records in the White case requires the giving of oral testimony by the custodian in this case. From the fact that the custodian has no privilege with respect to the union books in his possession, the Government reasons that he also has no privilege with respect to questions seeking to ascertain the whereabouts of books and records which have been subpoenaed but not produced. In other words, when the custodian fails to produce the books, he must, according to the Government, explain or account under oath for their nonproduction, even though to do so may tend to incriminate him.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment suggests no such exception. It guarantees that \"No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . .\" A custodian, by assuming the duties of his office, undertakes \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 124]\n\u00a0\n the obligation to produce the books of which he is custodian in response to a rightful exercise of the State's visitorial powers. But he cannot lawfully be compelled, in the absence of a grant of adequate immunity from prosecution, to condemn himself by his own oral testimony.\n\nIn the Wilson case, supra, which is the leading case for the proposition that corporate officers may not invoke their personal privilege against self-incrimination to prevent the production of corporate records, Mr. Justice Hughes, speaking for the Court, drew the distinction sharply. He said, \"They [the custodians of corporate records] may decline to utter upon the witness stand a single self-criminating word. They may demand that any accusation against them individually be established without the aid of their oral testimony or the compulsory production by them of their private papers.\" \n221 \nU.S., at 385\n. In the White case, supra, the Court was careful to point out that \"The subpoena duces tecum was directed to the union and demanded the production only of its official documents and records\" (\n322 \nU.S., at 704\n), that \"He [White, the custodian of the union's records] had not been subpoenaed personally to testify\" (id., at 695-696), and that \"there was no effort or indicated intention to examine him personally as a witness\" (id., at 696). And in Shapiro v. United States, \n335 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, holding that the privilege against self-incrimination did not apply to records required to be kept by food licensees under wartime OPA regulations, the Court said, \"Of course all oral testimony by individuals can properly be compelled only by exchange of immunity for waiver of privilege.\" There is no hint in these decisions that a custodian of corporate or association books waives his constitutional privilege as to oral testimony by assuming the duties of his office. By accepting custodianship of records he \"has voluntarily assumed a duty which overrides his claim of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 125]\n\u00a0\n privilege\" only with respect to the production of the records themselves. Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361, 380\n.\n\nUnited States v. Austin-Bagley Corp., 31 F.2d 229, and cases following it\n3\n are relied upon by the Government. Those cases, holding that a corporate officer who has been required by subpoena to produce corporate documents may also be required, by oral testimony, to identify them, are distinguishable and we need not pass on their validity. The custodian's act of producing books or records in response to a subpoena duces tecum is itself a representation that the documents produced are those demanded by the subpoena. Requiring the custodian to identify or authenticate the documents for admission in evidence merely makes explicit what is implicit in the production itself. The custodian is subjected to little, if any, further danger of incrimination. However, in the instant case, the Government is seeking to compel the custodian to do more than identify documents already produced. It seeks to compel him to disclose, by his oral testimony, the whereabouts of books and records which he has failed to produce. It even seeks to make the custodian name the persons in whose possession the missing books may be found. Answers to such questions are more than \"auxiliary to the production\" of unprivileged corporate or association records.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 126]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Government cites but one federal case, United States v. Field, 193 F.2d 92, as directly supporting its position.\n5\n In that case, the trustees of a bail fund were held in contempt for failure to produce records of the fund pursuant to a subpoena. After affirming the convictions on that ground, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit went on to consider, by way of dictum, other contentions raised by the trustees. One of their contentions was that questions about the location and production of records were improper. The court, relying on several cases in which a custodian was compelled to identify records which he had already produced, said that the questions pertaining to the location of the records \"were \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 127]\n\u00a0\n proper under the precedents.\" Id., at 97. The cases cited, however, do not support the court's dictum.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government suggests that subpoenaed corporate and association records will be obtained more readily for law-enforcement purposes if their custodian is threatened with summary commitment for contempt in failing to testify as to their whereabouts, rather than with prosecution for disobedience of the subpoena to produce the records themselves. We need not concern ourselves with the relative efficacy of those procedures.\n7\n There is a great \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 128]\n\u00a0\n difference between them. The compulsory production of corporate or association records by their custodian is readily justifiable, even though the custodian protests against it for personal reasons, because he does not own the records and has no legally cognizable interest in them. However, forcing the custodian to testify orally as to the whereabouts of nonproduced records requires him to disclose the contents of his own mind. He might be compelled to convict himself out of his own mouth. That is contrary to the spirit and letter of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The questions were as follows: \"I am going to ask you certain questions, including some that were put to you on Thursday, which you declined to answer. Referring to the books and records of Local 269 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have you at any time been in custody of those books and records? . . . . \"Mr. Curcio, have you ever had possession of the books and records of this local? . . . . \"Did you have custody and control of these records last Thursday? . . . . \"Do you have possession of those records or any of them today? . . . . \"Do you have custody and control of any of those records today? . . . . \"Where are any of those records today, if you know? . . . . \"Who has any of those records today, if you know? . . . . \"Where were any of these records or all of these records a week ago Thursday? . . . . \"Where were any or all of these records a week ago Saturday? . . . . \"Where were any or all these records a week ago last Monday? . . . . \"Where were any or all of these records yesterday? . . . . \"Where are any or all of these records today? . . . . \"Who, if you know, had any or all of these records a week ago last Saturday? . . . . \"Who had any or all of these records a week ago yesterday? . . . . \"Who has any or all of these records today? . . . .\" The above questions were selected by the Government from 225 that were asked petitioner before the grand jury. He was directed by the foreman of the grand jury to answer these 15, and, upon his refusal to do so under claim of his privilege against self-incrimination, the District Court advised him that it proposed to ask him those questions itself, and that his failure to answer them would constitute contempt of court. The District Judge thereupon asked petitioner these questions in open court in the presence of the grand jury. Petitioner refused to answer each of them, and stated that he refused to do so because his answers might tend to incriminate him.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The grand jury was investigating union racketeering. The newspapers had featured charges that petitioner's union was one of seven \"phantom locals\" of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and that it was dominated by gangsters and racketeers. Petitioner conceded that he had a prison record and it was charged that the president of Local 269 was Johnny DioGuardia, allegedly one of the key figures in union racketeering in the New York area. In this context, the questions were incriminating. See 18 U.S.C. 1503 and 1951. \"To sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 122]\n\u00a0\n responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\" Hoffman v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 479, 486\n-487. See also, Trock v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 976\n; Emspak v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 190\n; Singleton v.

Lay Fish Co., 13 F.2d 136, 137.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The leading case of United States v. Austin-Bagley Corp., supra, at 233, 234, explains the scope and limitations of this doctrine. In that case, the secretary-treasurer of a corporation, who was charged with conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act, was called to the stand by the Government and compelled to identify the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 126]\n\u00a0\n minutes of the corporation. Circuit Judge Learned Hand, for the Court of Appeals, upheld this procedure, stating: \"That the production of the books and documents could be compelled, even if they contained entries incriminating the accused, is now well-settled law. . . . However, the availability of the documents does not necessarily determine that of the testimony by which they may be authenticated. Conceivably it might be possible to force their production, and yet their possessor be protected from proving by his oath that they were what they purport to be. . . . \"While, therefore, we do not disguise the fact that there is here a possible, if tenuous, distinction, we think that the greater includes the less, and that, since the production can be forced, it may be made effective by compelling the producer to declare that the documents are genuine. . . . Hence it appears to us that the case [Heike v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 131\n] determines that testimony auxiliary to the production is as unprivileged as are the documents themselves. By accepting the office of custodian the holder not only exposes himself to producing the documents, but to making their use possible without requiring other proof than his own.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Government also cites Bleakley v. Schlesinger, 294 N. Y. 312, 62 N. E. 2d 85, holding that a corporation officer who fails to produce corporate records pursuant to a subpoena must give a reasonable explanation or suffer the penalty for nonproduction. But cf. Bradley v. O'Hare, 2 App. Div. 2d 436, 156 N. Y. S. 2d 533, where questions put to a union official relating to the whereabouts of union records were held privileged.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Moreover, prior and subsequent decisions of the same court, in which two of the same judges participated, contradict the statement contained in the Field case. In United States v. Daisart Sportswear, Inc., 169 F.2d 856, 861-862, the court stated that \"we do not believe that the principle of the Austin-Bagley case, supra, may be projected so that a corporate officer may be compelled to testify as to any and all phases of the corporation's activities, without at the same time obtaining a grant of immunity for the incriminating matter he is compelled to disclose.\" And further, that \"the production of records must be distinguished from oral testimony as to what the records would contain, had they been produced.\" Id., at 862. Subsequently, in United States v. Patterson, 219 F.2d 659, 662, the court, in reversing a contempt conviction for refusal to produce records, approved the trial court's ruling that questions relating to the whereabouts of the records were privileged. \"The defendant can here legally be jailed only for a contempt in failing to produce the sought-after books when they are fairly shown to be presently within his power and control. He cannot legally be jailed for contempt for invoking his constitutionally protected privilege not to be a witness against himself.\" See also, Lopiparo v. United States, 216 F.2d 87, where the trial court upheld the custodian's claim of privilege with respect to oral testimony pertaining to corporate records.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In this case petitioner might have been proceeded against for his failure to produce the records demanded by the subpoena duces tecum. See Nilva v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 385\n; United States v. Fleischman, \n339 \nU.S. 349\n; United States v. White, \n322 \nU.S. 694\n; Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361\n. From a memorandum filed by the Government, it appears that \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 128]\n\u00a0\n petitioner later did produce for the grand jury certain books and records of the union when threatened with a commitment for contempt for his failure to comply with a subsequent subpoena duces tecum issued to him in his representative capacity. The Government suggested that this subsequent compliance had rendered this proceeding moot, but we believe that it did not do so because the order for petitioner's commitment was for criminal, not civil, contempt. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 118, 129]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDELLI PAOLI v. UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 33\nArgued: October 18, 1956Decided: January 14, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner is one of five co-defendants convicted in a joint trial in a federal court on a federal charge of conspiring to deal unlawfully in alcohol. Without deleting references to petitioner, the court admitted in evidence a confession of another co-defendant, made after termination of the conspiracy; but the court stated clearly at the time, on several other occasions, and in its charge to the jury, that the confession was to be considered only in determining the guilt of the confessor and not that of any of the other defendants. The conspiracy was simple; the separate interests of each defendant were emphasized throughout the trial; admission of the confession was postponed to the end of the Government's case; in the main, the confession merely corroborated what the Government had already established; its references to petitioner were largely cumulative; and there was nothing in the record indicating that the jury was confused or failed to follow the court's instructions. Held: Petitioner's conviction is sustained. Pp. 233-243.\n\n 1. The evidence admitted against petitioner was sufficient to sustain his conviction. Pp. 234-236.\n\n\n 2. Under the circumstances of this case, the court's instructions to the jury provided petitioner with sufficient protection, so that the admission of his co-defendant's confession, strictly limited to use against the confessor, did not constitute reversible error against petitioner. Krulewitch v. United States, \n336 \nU.S. 440\n, distinguished. Pp. 236-243.\n\n\n (a) The court's instructions to the jury were sufficiently clear.

Greenberg argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nJ. F. Bishop argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney and Beatrice Rosenberg. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 233]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nA joint trial in this case resulted in the conviction of five co-defendants on a federal charge of conspiring to deal unlawfully in alcohol. Only the petitioner, Orlando Delli Paoli, appealed. The principal issue is whether the trial court committed reversible error, as against petitioner, by admitting in evidence a confession of a co-defendant, made after the termination of the alleged conspiracy. The trial court declined to delete references to petitioner from the confession but stated clearly that the confession was to be considered only in determining the guilt of the confessor and not that of other defendants. For the reasons hereafter stated, we agree that, under the circumstances of this case, such a restricted admission of the confession did not constitute reversible error.\n\nIn the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the jury convicted petitioner and four co-defendants, Margiasso, Pierro, Whitley and King, of conspiring to possess and transport alcohol in unstamped containers and to evade payment of federal taxes on the alcohol.\n1\n The Government's witnesses testified that they had observed actions of the defendants which disclosed the procedure through which Margiasso, Pierro and petitioner supplied unstamped alcohol to their customers, such as King and Whitley. The Government also offered, for use against Whitley alone, his written confession made in the presence of a government agent and of his own counsel after the termination of the conspiracy.\n2\n The court postponed the introduction of Whitley's \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 234]\n\u00a0\n confession until the close of the Government's case. At that time, the court admitted it with an emphatic warning that it was to be considered solely in determining the guilt of Whitley and not in determining the guilt of any other defendant. The court repeated this admonition in its charge to the jury.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction, with one judge dissenting. 229 F.2d 319. We granted certiorari especially to consider the admissibility of Whitley's post-conspiracy confession. \n350 \nU.S. 992\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nPetitioner first attacks the sufficiency of the evidence connecting him with the conspiracy. The Government's evidence, exclusive of Whitley's confession, showed that the defendants' conspiracy to deal in unstamped alcohol centered around a garage used for storage purposes in a residential district of the Bronx in New York City and a gasoline service station, also in the Bronx. The service station was used by Margiasso, Pierro and petitioner as a place to meet customers and transfer alcohol.\n\nIn December 1949, petitioner, using the alias of \"Bobbie London,\" was associated with Margiasso and Pierro in inspecting the garage and in negotiating for its purchase. For $2,000 in cash, title to the garage and an adjacent cottage was taken in the name of Pierro's sister. In 1950, the garage was repaired, its windows boarded up and its doors strengthened and padlocked. Petitioner lived not far away, in the Bronx, and was observed, from time to time, at the garage or using a panel truck which was registered under a false name. During the daytime, this truck generally was parked near petitioner's home or the garage but neighbors testified that it was in use late at night. In it petitioner transported various articles to the garage or elsewhere. On one occasion, petitioner, with Margiasso, loaded it with bundles of cartons suited to \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 235]\n\u00a0\n the packing of 5-gallon cans. Late in 1951, petitioner used an additional truck, also registered under a false name. In addition, he frequently drove to the service station in a Cadillac car. On December 18, 1951, he used this car in making delivery of a large package to a nearby bar.\n\nDuring December 1951, the service station often was used as a meeting place for Margiasso, Pierro and petitioner. Margiasso and petitioner were there on the evening of December 28.\n3\n At about 7 and 10 p. m., respectively. King and Whitley arrived. Each turned over his car to Margiasso. Margiasso drove King's car to the garage and returned with it heavily loaded. King then drove it away. Government agents followed him until he stopped in Harlem. There they arrested him and took possession of 19 5-gallon cans of unstamped alcohol found in his car. Later in the evening, Margiasso took Whitley's car to the garage and was arrested in it when leaving the still open garage. The agents thereupon seized 113 5-gallon cans of unstamped alcohol they found in the garage. Whitley, who had been waiting for Margiasso at the service station with $1,000 in a paper bag, was arrested on the agents' return with Margiasso.\n\nPetitioner's presence at the service station on the evening of December 28 was closely related to these events. He waited there with King for Margiasso to return with King's car containing the 19 cans of alcohol. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 236]\n\u00a0\n He was there again with Margiasso at about 10 p. m. but left shortly before Whitley came. He returned while Margiasso, Whitley and the agents were there and was arrested while attempting to drive away.\n\nPetitioner contends that the above evidence shows merely that he was a friend and associate of Pierro and Margiasso. We conclude, however, from the record as a whole, that the jury could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that petitioner was associated with Pierro and Margiasso in the purchase of the garage and the use of the panel truck, that he knew that unstamped alcohol was stored in the garage, that he had access to it and that he was an active participant in the transfers of alcohol to Whitley and King. Accordingly, we agree with Circuit Judge Learned Hand's statement made for the court below, following his own summary of the evidence of petitioner's participation in the conspiracy:\n\n\"Not only was all this enough to connect him with the business, but the jurors could hardly have failed to find that he was in the enterprise. The whole business was illegal and carried on surreptitiously; and the possibility that unless he were a party to the venture, Pierro and Margiasso would have associated [with] him to the extent we have mentioned is too remote for serious discussion.\" 229 F.2d, at 320.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nIn considering the admissibility of the Whitley confession, we start with the premise that the other evidence against petitioner was sufficient to sustain his conviction. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 237]\n\u00a0\n If Whitley's confession had included no reference to petitioner's participation in the conspiracy, its admission would not have been open to petitioner's objection. Similarly, if the trial court had deleted from the confession all references to petitioner's connection with the conspiracy, the admission of the remainder would not have been objectionable. The impracticality of such deletion was, however, agreed to by both the trial court and the entire court below and cannot well be controverted.\n\nThis Court long has held that a declaration made by one conspirator, in furtherance of a conspiracy and prior to its termination, may be used against the other conspirators. However, when such a declaration is made by a conspirator after the termination of the conspiracy, it may be used only against the declarant and under appropriate instructions to the jury.\n\n \". . . Declarations of one conspirator may be used against the other conspirator not present on the theory that the declarant is the agent of the other, and the admissions of one are admissible against both under a standard exception to the hearsay rule applicable to the statements of a party. Clune v. United States, \n159 \nU.S. 590, 593\n. See United States v. Gooding, 12 Wheat. 460, 468-470. But such declaration can be used against the co-conspirator only when made in furtherance of the conspiracy. Fiswick v. United States, \n329 \nU.S. 211, 217\n; Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263, 308\n-309. There can be no furtherance of a conspiracy that has ended. Therefore, the declarations of a conspirator do not bind the co-conspirator if made after the conspiracy has ended. That is the teaching of Krulewitch v. United States, supra [\n336 \nU.S. 440\n], and Fiswick v. United States, supra. Those cases dealt only with declarations of one conspirator after the conspiracy had ended. . . . \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 238]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"Relevant declarations or admissions of a conspirator made in the absence of the co-conspirator, and not in furtherance of the conspiracy, may be admissible in a trial for conspiracy as against the declarant to prove the declarant's participation therein. The court must be careful at the time of the admission and by its instructions to make it clear that the evidence is limited as against the declarant only. Therefore, when the trial court admits against all of the conspirators a relevant declaration of one of the conspirators after the conspiracy has ended, without limiting it to the declarant, it violates the rule laid down in Krulewitch. Such declaration is inadmissible as to all but the declarant. . . .\n\n\n \". . . These declarations [i. e., those admissible only as to the declarant] must be carefully and clearly limited by the court at the time of their admission and the jury instructed as to such declarations and the limitations put upon them. Even then, in most instances of a conspiracy trial of several persons together, the application of the rule places a heavy burden upon the jurors to keep in mind the admission of certain declarations and to whom they have been restricted and in some instances for what specific purpose. While these difficulties have been pointed out in several cases, e. g., Krulewitch v. United States, supra, at 453 (concurring opinion); Blumenthal v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 539, 559\n-560; Nash v. United States, 54 F.2d 1006, 1006-1007, the rule has nonetheless been applied. Blumenthal v. United States, supra; Nash v. United States, supra; United States v. Gottfried, 165 F.2d 360, 367.\" Lutwak v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 604, 617\n-618, 619. See also, Opper v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 84, 95\n. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 239]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Petitioner contends that Krulewitch v. United States, \n336 \nU.S. 440\n, requires the exclusion of a post-conspiracy confession of a co-conspirator. That case dealt with the scope of the co-conspirators' exception to the hearsay rule. This Court held that the utterance of a co-conspirator made after the termination of the conspiracy was inadmissible against other co-conspirators. Unlike the instant case, the declarant was not on trial and the question whether his utterance, implicating other alleged conspirators, could be admitted in a joint trial solely against the declarant, under proper limiting instructions, was neither presented nor decided.\n\nThe issue here is whether, under all the circumstances, the court's instructions to the jury provided petitioner with sufficient protection so that the admission of Whitley's confession, strictly limited to use against Whitley, constituted reversible error. The determination of this issue turns on whether the instructions were sufficiently clear and whether it was reasonably possible for the jury to follow them.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the confession was admitted in evidence, the trial court said:\n\n \"The proof of the Government has now been completed except for the testimony of the witness Greenberg as to the alleged statement or affidavit of the defendant Whitley. This affidavit or admission will \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 240]\n\u00a0\n be considered by you solely in connection with your determination of the guilt or innocence of the defendant Whitley. It is not to be considered as proof in connection with the guilt or innocence of any of the other defendants.\n\n\n \"The reason for this distinction is this: An admission by defendant after his arrest of participation in alleged crime may be considered as evidence by the jury against him, together with other evidence, because it is, as the law describes it, an admission against interest which a person ordinarily would not make. However, if such defendant after his arrest implicates other defendants in such an admission it is not evidence against those defendants because as to them it is nothing more than hearsay evidence.\"\n\n\n The substance of this admonition was repeated several times during the cross-examination of one of the government agents before whom the confession was made and a final warning to the same effect was included in the court's charge to the jury.\n6\n Nothing could have been \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 241]\n\u00a0\n more clear than these limiting instructions. Petitioner, who made no objection to these instructions at the trial, concedes their clarity.\n\nWe may also fairly proceed on the basis that the jury followed these instructions. Several factors favor this conclusion: (1) The conspiracy was so simple in its character that the part of each defendant in it was easily understood. There was no mass trial and no multiplicity of evidentiary restrictions. (2) The separate interests of each defendant were emphasized throughout the trial. Margiasso and petitioner were represented by one attorney. Each of the other defendants was represented by a separate attorney. Throughout the trial, the separate interests of each defendant were repeatedly emphasized by his attorney and recognized by the court.\n7\n A separate trial never was requested on behalf of any defendant. (3) The trial court postponed the introduction of Whitley's confession until the rest of the Government's case was in, thus making it easier for the jury to consider \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 242]\n\u00a0\n the confession separately from the other testimony. This separation was pointed out by the trial court. Neither side thereafter introduced any evidence. (4) In the main, Whitley's confession merely corroborated what the Government already had established. In the light of the Government's uncontradicted testimony implicating petitioner in the conspiracy, the references to petitioner in the confession were largely cumulative. (5) There is nothing in the record indicating that the jury was confused or that it failed to follow the court's instructions.\n\nIt is a basic premise of our jury system that the court states the law to the jury and that the jury applies that law to the facts as the jury finds them. Unless we proceed on the basis that the jury will follow the court's instructions where those instructions are clear and the circumstances are such that the jury can reasonably be expected to follow them, the jury system makes little sense. Based on faith that the jury will endeavor to follow the court's instructions, our system of jury trial has produced one of the most valuable and practical mechanisms in human experience for dispensing substantial justice.\n\n\"To say that the jury might have been confused amounts to nothing more than an unfounded speculation that the jurors disregarded clear instructions of the court in arriving at their verdict. Our theory of trial relies upon the ability of a jury to follow instructions. There is nothing in this record to call for reversal because of any confusion or injustice arising from the joint trial. The record contains substantial competent evidence upon which the jury could find petitioner guilty.\" Opper v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 84, 95\n. See also, Lutwak v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 604, 615\n-620; Blumenthal v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 539, 552\n-553. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 243]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n There may be practical limitations to the circumstances under which a jury should be left to follow instructions but this case does not present them. As a practical matter, the choice here was between separate trials and a joint trial in which the confession would be admitted under appropriate instructions. Such a choice turns on the circumstances of the particular case and lies largely within the discretion of the trial judge. Accordingly, we conclude that leaving petitioner's case to the jury under the instructions here given was not reversible error and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n [For dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, see post, p. 246.]\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n\"Whitley's confession reads as follows:\n\n\n\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n\n\"SOUTHERN JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF NEW YORK,\n\n\n\"ss.:\n\n\n\"JAMES WHITLEY, being duly sworn, deposes and says:\n\n\n\"I reside at 65 West 133rd Street, Apartment 4E, New York, N. Y. I make this statement in the presence of my attorney, Mr. Bertram J. Adams of 299 Broadway, New York, N. Y., after being fully advised that under the Constitution of the United States I have the privilege and right of not saying anything at all; that if I answer any question anything I say could be used against me in any criminal proceeding. Being fully aware of my rights, I make this statement of my own free will to Special Investigators Albert Miller and William Greenberg in the office of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division, 143 Liberty Street, New York, N. Y. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 244]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Sometime around Thanksgiving of 1949, a friend of mine introduced me to a man known to me as Tony. This man asked me if I wanted to buy some alcohol and I told him I did. The meeting occurred on 126th Street in Harlem. The man then told me to meet him the next day at a candy store on the south side of 119th Street, just east of First Avenue. When I got there, Tony introduced me to a man whose name I do not know. This man told me to meet him that night on 100th Street and Second Avenue. I met him there. He took my car and drove away. A little while later he came back and told me that the car was parked on 103rd Street and Second Avenue. I had purchased two 5-gallon cans of alcohol on that occasion and paid him just before he drove away in my car. Thereafter, I would meet this man around the candy store about twice a week and the same procedure would be followed. This continued until about June or July of 1950.\n\n\n\"Tony was about 5' 4\" in height, about 55 years of age, had a dark complexion and stocky build and, I believe, had brown eyes. He was apparently of Italian extraction. The other man who sold me the alcohol was apparently also of Italian descent, and he had a dark complexion. He spoke in broken English. He had black hair and was about 27 or 28 years of age and was about 5' 9\" in height. (Sometime in 1950, Investigator Whited of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division asked me about him and showed me his picture.)\n\n\n\"At about that time, this man sent me to Carl. He introduced Carl to me and told me that Carl would take care of me from then on. I would meet Carl on Second Avenue between 121st Street and 122nd Street in a seafood restaurant and would purchase the alcohol from him.\n\n\n\"Carl is about 5' 10\" in height, has blond hair, blue eyes, light complexion and is about 30 years of age. He is apparently of Italian descent. He is about 160 pounds. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 245]\n\u00a0\n Carl would usually come to my home to see me and ask me if I needed anything.\n\n\n\"Just before Carl went to jail in 1950, he introduced me to Bobby. I have been shown a photograph bearing ATU 3643 N. Y. dated 12\/29\/51 of Orlandi Delli Paoli, and I identify it as that of the man known to me as Bobby. This was sometime in the summer of 1951. Bobby would come to my house to see me. If I placed an order with him he would set the date and the time for seven or eight o'clock in the evening when I was to pick up the alcohol. The first time I met him at 138th Street and Bruckner Boulevard, in the Bronx. He took my car and was gone about one-half hour and then returned with the alcohol. The second time I met him on the corner of Bruckner Boulevard and Soundview Avenue. From then on he would alternate the procedure: I would meet him one night on 138th Street and the next time at Soundview Avenue.\n\n\n\"About two months ago, I began meeting Bobby at the Shell gasoline station known as the Bronx River Service Station on Bruckner Boulevard just past the bridge crossing over to Bronx River. I would usually leave my car parked on the street near the gas station and meet Bobby outside of the gas station. He told me not to go into the gas station as the attendant might not like it.\n\n\n\"About a month ago, Bobby introduced me to another man whose name I do not know. I have been shown a photograph marked ATU 3642 N. Y., dated 12\/29\/51 of Carmine Margiasso, and identify it as that of the man to whom Bobby introduced me. Bobby also told me that if he was not present when I met Margiasso, I was not to give Margiasso any money but was to pay him (Bobby) the next time I saw him. Margiasso also followed the same procedure: He would take my car, would be gone about 20 minutes, and then return with the alcohol. Margiasso picked up my car about four times. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 246]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"My purchases from Bobby would consist of two or three 5-gallon cans of alcohol at a time and were made once or twice a week. The last two times I paid Bobby $38 a can.\n\n\n\"On the evening of Friday, December 28, 1951, I had ordered two cans, and when Margiasso took my car I waited in the lunch room near the gas station. When I thought it was time for Margiasso to return, I went over to the gas station and waited in the office after purchasing a package of cigarettes. Two officers who were Federal officers came in and placed me and William Hudson under arrest. Shortly after that happened, Bobby drove up and was arrested by the Federal officers.\n\n\n\"I have read the above statement consisting of three pages and it is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.\n\n  \"(Signed) JAMES WHITLEY    \"James Whitley\n\n\n\n\"Sworn to before me this 5th day of January 1952.\n\n\n\"(Signed) WILLIAM GREENBERG  \"William Greenberg, Spec.

But any admissions by the defendant Whitley are not to be considered as proof in connection with the guilt or innocence of any of the other defendants. The reason for that I explained before to you, that the admission by a defendant after his arrest of participation in an alleged crime may be considered as evidence by the jury against him with the other evidence because it is, as the law describes it, an admission against interest which a person ordinarily would not make. However, if such a person after his arrest implicates other defendants in such admission it is not evidence against them, because as to those defendants it is nothing more than hearsay evidence. I advise you of that in connection with the testimony of the last witness [Greenberg] as to any oral statements made by Whitley or any written statements made by Whitley.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Safeguarding the separate interests of the defendants, the court also said:\n\n\"The existence of the conspiracy and each defendant's connection with it must be established by individual proof based upon reasonable inference to be drawn from such defendant's own actions, his own conduct, his own declarations, and his own connection with the actions and conduct of the other alleged co-conspirators.\n\n.   .   .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"To find any defendant guilty of conspiracy you must find that he actively participated therein. Mere knowledge of an illegal act on the part of any co-conspirator is insufficient. Mere association of one defendant with another does not establish the existence of a conspiracy.\n\n.   .   .  .  .\n\n\n\n\". . . if you find that every circumstance relied upon as incriminating is susceptible of two interpretations, each of which appears to be reasonable, and one of which points to a defendant's guilt, the other to his innocence, it is your duty to accept that of innocence and reject that which points to guilt.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, dissenting.\n\nProsecutions for conspiracy present difficulties and temptations familiar to anyone with experience as a federal prosecutor. The difficulties derive from observance of the rules governing evidence admissible against some but not all defendants in a criminal case. The temptations \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 247]\n\u00a0\n derive from the advantages of prosecuting in one trial two or more persons collaborating in a criminal enterprise. One of the most recurring of the difficulties pertains to incriminating declarations by one or more of the defendants that are not admissible against others. The dilemma is usually resolved by admitting such evidence against the declarant but cautioning the jury against its use in determining the guilt of the others. The fact of the matter is that too often such admonition against misuse is intrinsically ineffective in that the effect of such a non admissible declaration cannot be wiped from the brains of the jurors. The admonition therefore becomes a futile collocation of words and fails of its purpose as a legal protection to defendants against whom such a declaration should not tell. While enforcing the rule of admitting the declaration solely against a declarant and admonishing the jury not to consider it against other defendants, Judge Learned Hand, in a series of cases, has recognized the psychological feat that this solution of the dilemma demands of juries. He thus stated the problem:\n\n\"In effect, however, the rule probably furthers, rather than impedes, the search for truth, and this perhaps excuses the device which satisfies form while it violates substance; that is, the recommendation to the jury of a mental gymnastic which is beyond, not only their powers, but anybody else's.\" Nash v. United States, 54 F.2d 1006, 1007.\n\n\n It may well be that where such a declaration only glancingly, as it were, affects a co-defendant who cannot be charged with the admitted declaration, the rule enforced by the Court in this case does too little harm not to leave its application to the discretion of the trial judge. But where the conspirator's statement is so damning to another against whom it is inadmissible, as is true in this case, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 248]\n\u00a0\n the difficulty of introducing it against the declarant without inevitable harm to a co-conspirator, the petitioner in this case, is no justification for causing such harm. The Government should not have the windfall of having the jury be influenced by evidence against a defendant which, as a matter of law, they should not consider but which they cannot put out of their minds. After all, the prosecution could use the confession against the confessor and at the same time avoid such weighty unfairness against a defendant who cannot be charged with the declaration by not trying all the co-conspirators in a single trial.\n\nIt is no answer to suggest that here the petitioner-defendant's guilt is amply demonstrated by the uninfected testimony against him. That is the best of reasons for trying him freed from the inevitable unfairness of being affected by testimony not admissible against him. In any event, it is not for an appellate tribunal to know how the jury's mind would have operated if powerfully improper evidence had not in effect been put in the scale against petitioner.\n\nIn substance, I agree with the dissenting opinion of Judge Frank, below, 229 F.2d 319, 322 and would therefore reverse. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 232, 249]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDISTRICT LODGE 34 v.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe sole question involved in this proceeding under 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act\n1\n concerns the power of the Commission in framing an order pursuant to its finding that respondents had conspired to adopt and use a zone delivered pricing system in their sale of lead pigments.\n2\n In its general cease and desist order prohibiting concert of action among respondents in the further use \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 421]\n\u00a0\n of such system, the Commission inserted a provision directing each respondent individually to cease and desist from adopting the same or a similar system of pricing for the purpose or with the effect of \"matching\" the prices of competitors. The respondents assert that this is beyond the power of the Commission, and the Court of Appeals agreed, 227 F.2d 825, striking that provision from the Commission's order. We granted certiorari, \n351 \nU.S. 961\n. because of the importance of the question in the administration of the Act. We restore the stricken provision of the Commission order, permitting it to stand with the interpretations placed upon it in this opinion.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe original proceeding under 5 of the Act was commenced in 1944. The order was entered on a second amended complaint filed in 1946. After protracted hearings, the Commission entered its findings which the Court of Appeals has held to be supported by substantial evidence. The findings material here are as follows:\n\nThe pricing practice of the industry as to the sale of white lead in oil prior to 1933 is not shown in the record. However, National Lead had as early as 1910 sold this pigment on the basis of territorial differentials involving free freight to specified towns. The differentials added to the base price were generally uniform for some 589 cities listed in National Lead's pricing system in 1933. The charge to purchasers outside the listed cities was the base price plus actual freight to the nearest listed city. In the sales of dry white lead and lead oxides it appears that by the sales practice prior to 1933 there was a uniform delivered price in the case of the white lead, while the purchasers of lead oxides paid the freight charge in addition to the base price.\n\nBeginning in July 1933, the industry held a series of meetings in Chicago for the ostensible purpose of drafting \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 422]\n\u00a0\n a code of fair competition to govern it under the National Industrial Recovery Act. These meetings resulted in an understanding and agreement among those attending, including respondents, to sell lead pigments \"on the basis of flat delivered prices to customers within designated zones, with uniform differentials applicable as between such zones . . . .\" 49 F. T. C. 840. Four zoning systems were established covering the various lead pigments. As an example, the system for white lead in oil and \"keg\" products consisted of 12 geographical zones, one known as a par zone. The remaining zones in this system were known as premium zones, the price in each being determined by adding a set premium to the par zone price. These premiums varied from $.125 per cwt. in two of the zones to a high of $1 per cwt. in the premium zone covering the State of New Mexico.\n3\n The zones were highly artificial and zone boundaries led to bizarre results at times, with purchasers located near the plants of respondents being charged higher prices than those located at a distance from the plants. The industry, including respondents, not only agreed to sell at the same zone delivered prices in identical geographical zones but also adopted uniform discounts, terms of sale, and differentials with respect to certain of their products. A further agreement was to sell white lead in oil on the basis of consignment contracts.\n\nThe Commission stated that \"nowhere in the code, nor in any preliminary draft of a code produced at the meetings of any of the committees, is there any reference to \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 423]\n\u00a0\n the use of zones or to territorial differences in the prices of lead pigments, or to the use of agency or consignment contracts or arrangements in the sale of white lead-in-oil.\" Id., at 839. The Commission added that \"with certain exceptions, the respondents have followed the pricing practices and have adhered to the terms and conditions for the sale of lead pigments agreed upon in 1933 and 1934 as herein found from 1934 to the present time.\" Id., at 849. The respondents admit that they are bound by these findings and we see no reason to disturb them.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe Commission entered an order prohibiting respondents from entering into or carrying out any \"planned common course of action,\" agreement, or conspiracy to sell at prices determined pursuant to a \"zone delivered price system,\" or any other system resulting in identical prices at the points of sale. The order also included a provision, to which respondents strenuously object, directing each of them to cease and desist from\n\n\"quoting or selling lead pigments at prices calculated or determined in whole or in part pursuant to or in accordance with a zone delivered price system for the purpose or with the effect of systematically matching the delivered price quotations or the delivered prices of other sellers of lead pigments and thereby preventing purchasers from finding any advantage in price in dealing with one or more sellers as against another.\" Id., at 873-874.\n\n\n The Commission, in an accompanying opinion, stated that in all cases where it found violations of the law, \"it is the Commission's duty to determine to the best of its ability the remedy necessary to suppress such activity and to take every precaution to preclude its revival.\" Id., at 884. In this case, the opinion pointed out, the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 424]\n\u00a0\n respondents cooperatively revised the pricing practices in the industry by establishing a \"uniform zone pricing system.\" Detailed discussions were carried on which resulted not only in an agreement, but \"maps showing the boundaries of the zones to be observed . . . were distributed\" by the individual respondents. Id., at 884. Each respondent has \"since that time . . . followed the pricing system and adhered to the zone boundaries so discussed and shown on these maps.\" Ibid. Discussing the complaint, the Commission in its opinion further noted that charges were included against each respondent as to its individual use of and adherence to the zone system of selling \"`for the purpose and with the effect of enabling the respondents to match exactly their offers to sell lead pigments to any prospective purchaser at any destination, thereby eliminating competition between and among themselves.'. . . It was the adherence by each of them to this system of pricing that made the combination work. . . . Unless and until each of the respondents is prohibited from so adhering to the system and from so using the zones, the evils springing from the combination, one of which is to eliminate price competition, may well continue indefinitely. Unless the respondents, representing practically the entire economic power in the industry, are deprived of the device which made their combination effective, an order merely prohibiting the combination may well be a useless gesture.\" Id., at 884-885. In its view, the Commission added, the \"prohibition is necessary, not because it is unlawful in all circumstances for an individual seller, acting independently, to sell its products on a delivered price basis in specified territories, but to make the order fully effective against the trade restraining conspiracy in which each of the respondents [defendants] participated.\" Id., at 884. When and if competition is restored and the individual \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 425]\n\u00a0\n prohibition is no longer necessary, the Commission expressed its intention, upon application, to vacate the latter provision of its order.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning we must understand the limits of the contested portion of the order. First, it is temporary. Though its life expectancy is not definite, it is clear that the Commission was creating a breathing spell during which independent pricing might be established without the hang-over of the long-existing pattern of collusion. Second, the order is directed solely at the use of a zone delivered pricing system\n4\n and no other. This system is a pricing method based on geographic divisions or zones, the boundaries of which are entirely drawn by the seller. His delivered price is the same throughout a particular geographic zone so drawn up by him. Customarily the delivered price is different between zones, though as here, widely separated zones, geographically, might have the same delivered price. It is well to mention here that while this Court has passed upon the validity of basing point systems of sales, Corn Products Refining Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, \n324 \nU.S. 726\n (1945), it has not decided the validity of the zone pricing plan used here. Third, zone delivered pricing per se is not banned by the order. The Commission might have made the order more specific by entering a flat prohibition of the use for a definite period of the device found to be \"the very cornerstone of the . . . conspiracy,\" i. e., zone pricing. See Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 386, 428\n (1945), where the corporate defendants were enjoined from \"forming or joining any such trade association\" for \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 426]\n\u00a0\n a period of five years. But the Commission chose the more flexible sanction, i. e., the limited use of zone delivered pricing. However, it concluded that the future use should be temporarily restricted for the protection of the public. And so, delivered zone pricing violates the order only when two conditions are present: (1) identical prices with competitors (2) resulting from zone delivered pricing. Considering these conditions with the mechanics of the zone plan, we see that the only way prices can be systematically identical is for the zones of competitors to be so drawn as to be in whole or in part identical and for zone prices to be the same in those zones which coincide or overlap.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nRespondents contend that the cease and desist order, as written, excludes the benefits of 2 (b) of the Clayton Act.\n6\n While 2 (b) \"does not concern itself with pricing systems . . . [but] only [with] the seller's `lower' price and [with] that only to the extent that it is made `in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor,'\" Federal Trade Commission v. A. E. Staley Mfg. Co., \n324 \nU.S. 746, 753\n (1945), this section is read into every Commission order. Federal Trade Commission v. Ruberoid Co., \n343 \nU.S. 470, 476\n (1952). Since 2 (b) must, therefore, be read into this order, the respondents are afforded all of the benefits of that section.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nIt is the contention of respondents that the contested paragraph of the order effectively bans the noncollusive, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 427]\n\u00a0\n individual use of zone pricing, a lawful, competitive sales method, and is therefore beyond the authority of the Commission. Respondents further assert that even if the Commission had such authority its exercise here was entirely improper, unnecessary, and would, in fact, hamper competition in the industry. They stress that the complaint did not include a charge that the individual use of zone pricing was unlawful; that it came into the case after the Trial Examiner had filed his recommended decision and order; and that respondents were denied the opportunity of rebutting the charge by evidence showing zone pricing to be \"a logical, economical, and competitive method of doing business.\" The insertion of the objectionable paragraph, they contend, violates due process in that they had no opportunity to defend. Since 2 (b) is read into every Commission order and since it would allow respondents to rebut the charge, their contention is completely answered and we shall not deal with it further.\n\nIt goes without saying that the requirements of a fair hearing include notice of the claims of the opposing party and an opportunity to meet them. Morgan v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 1\n (1938). The record indicates that the respondents were afforded those safeguards. The emphasis that there was no charge, no evidence, no finding to support the inclusion of the objectionable provision in the order is misplaced. Its insertion was nothing more than a mode of implementation, selected by the Commission, to enforce its findings of violations of the Act. Moreover, the record is replete with evidence that counsel supporting the complaint would seek the use of such a method of enforcement. As far back as in early 1947, while the case was before the Examiner, the issue concerning the effect of the zone pricing system used by respondents was before the Commission on motions to dismiss. Admittedly Court II of the complaint dealt with the use of the zone system itself. The Commission overruled the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 428]\n\u00a0\n motions to dismiss, adopting the view of counsel supporting the complaint that its allegations were directed against the effects of the alleged system or method, i. e., the zone pricing plan, and \"not against individual instances\" of discrimination in pricing. Furthermore, in May 1948, almost five years before the decree was entered, counsel supporting the complaint filed written exceptions to the recommended decision of the Examiner on the ground, among others, that it did not include a provision similar to the one objected to here. If respondents thought rebuttal evidence necessary, the record is bare of any effort on their part to offer it. Nor was any request made to reopen the case for that purpose after it reached the Commission.\n\nWe pass on to respondents' major contention questioning the power of the Commission. As the Court has said many times before, the Commission may exercise only the powers granted it by the Act. Federal Trade Commission v. Western Meat Co., \n272 \nU.S. 554, 559\n (1926). The relevant sections empower the Commission to prevent the use of unfair methods of competition and authorize it, after finding an unfair method present, to enter an order requiring the offender \"to cease and desist\" from using such unfair method.\n\nThe Court has held that the Commission is clothed with wide discretion in determining the type of order that is necessary to bring an end to the unfair practices found to exist. In Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, \n327 \nU.S. 608\n (1946), the Court named the Commission \"the expert body to determine what remedy is necessary to eliminate the unfair or deceptive trade practices which have been disclosed. It has wide latitude for judgment and the courts will not interfere except where the remedy selected has no reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist.\" Id., at 612-613. Thereafter, in Federal Trade Commission v. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 429]\n\u00a0\n Cement Institute, \n333 \nU.S. 683, 726\n (1948), the Court pointed out that the Congress, in passing the Act, \"felt that courts needed the assistance of men trained to combat monopolistic practices in the framing of judicial decrees in antitrust litigation.\" In the light of this, the Court reasoned, it should not \"lightly modify\" the orders of the Commission. Again, in Federal Trade Commission v. Ruberoid Co., supra, at 473, we said that \"if the Commission is to attain the objectives Congress envisioned, it cannot be required to confine its road block to the narrow lane the transgressor has traveled; it must be allowed effectively to close all roads to the prohibited goal, so that its order may not be by-passed with impunity.\" We pointed out there that Congress had placed the primary responsibility for fashioning orders upon the Commission. These cases narrow the issue to the question: Does the remedy selected have a \"reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist\"? We believe that it does. First, the simplicity of operation of the plan lends itself to unlawful manipulation; second, it had been used in the industry for almost a quarter of a century; and, third, its originator and chief beneficiary had been previously adjudged a violator of the antitrust laws. United States v. National Lead Co., \n332 \nU.S. 319\n (1947).\n\nThe respondents were found to have plainly disregarded the law. In this respect the Commission correctly considered the circumstances under which the illegal acts occurred. Those in utter disregard of law, as here, \"call for repression by sterner measures than where the steps could reasonably have been thought permissible.\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., \n340 \nU.S. 76\n. 89-90 (1950). Respondents made no appeal here from some of the findings as to their guilt. Having lost the battle on the facts, they hope to win the war on the type of decree. They fight for the right to continue to use \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 430]\n\u00a0\n individually the very same weapon with which they carried on their unlawful enterprise. The Commission concluded that this must not be permitted. It was \"not obliged to assume, contrary to common experience, that a violator of the antitrust laws will relinquish the fruits of his violation more completely than [it] requires . . . .\" International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392, 400\n (1947). Although the zone plan might be used for some lawful purposes, decrees often suppress a lawful device when it is used to carry out an unlawful purpose. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436\n (1940); United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., \n321 \nU.S. 707\n (1944). In such instances the Court is obliged not only to suppress the unlawful practice but to take such reasonable action as is calculated to preclude the revival of the illegal practices. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, supra, at 461; Local 167, I. B. T. v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293\n (1934). See also United States v. United States Gypsum Co., supra; United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., \n323 \nU.S. 173, 188\n (1944).\n7\n We therefore conclude that, under the circumstances here, the Commission was justified in its determination that it was necessary to include some restraint in its order against the individual corporations in order to prevent a continuance of the unfair competitive practices found to exist. Federal Trade Commission v. Standard Education Society, \n302 \nU.S. 112, 120\n (1937). We shall now examine the restraint imposed.\n\nRespondents point out that in only one other case in the long history of the Commission has a similar order \n\n[352 \nU.S. 419, 431]\n\u00a0\n been entered. They say our restoration of the contested paragraph will effectively prevent competition. In its supplemental memorandum, see note 5, supra, the Commission has clearly stated its understanding of the scope and effect of the order. It is our conclusion that the order was not intended to and does not prohibit or interfere with independent delivered zone pricing per se. Nor does it prohibit the practice of the absorption of actual freight as such in order to foster competition. Furthermore, as we have said, there is read into the order the provision of 2 (b) of the Clayton Act as to the right of a seller in good faith to meet the lower price of a competitor. This is not to say that a seller may plead this section in defense of the use of an entire pricing system. The section is designed to protect competitors in individual transactions.\n\nRespondents pose hypothetical situations which they say may rise up to plague them. However, \"we think it would not be good judicial administration,\" as our late Brother Jackson said in International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392, 401\n (1947), to strike the contested paragraph of the order to meet such conjectures. The Commission has reserved jurisdiction to meet just such contingencies. As actual situations arise they can be presented to the Commission in evidentiary form rather than as fantasies. And, we might add, if there is a burden that cannot be made lighter after application to the Commission, then respondents must remember that those caught violating the Act must expect some fencing in.

Though conflicting affidavits concerning petitioner's contentions of errors at his trial had been filed, the District Court refused his request for a transcript of the record and denied his application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, on the ground that his appeal was \"not taken in good faith.\" Petitioner then applied to the Court of Appeals for permission to appeal in forma pauperis; but that Court denied his request, indicating that his claimed errors were without substance. Held: Petitioner has not been afforded an adequate opportunity to show the Court of Appeals that his claimed errors are not frivolous so as to enable that Court to review properly the District Court's certification that the appeal was in bad faith. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause is remanded to it for further proceedings.

Under 28 U.S.C. 1915 he applied to the District Court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Petitioner, who was assisted by court-appointed counsel in preparing his application, contended that the evidence was insufficient to justify \n\n[354 \nU.S. 521, 522]\n\u00a0\n his conviction and that the trial court had committed reversible error by permitting the United States Attorney to ask him irrelevant and prejudicial questions about another criminal offense. Petitioner requested that the District Court make available a transcript of the trial record so he could substantiate his claimed errors. In reply the United States Attorney filed an affidavit asserting that the evidence was sufficient to sustain petitioner's conviction. However the affidavit did not directly controvert petitioner's claim that the prosecuting attorney had been allowed to inject irrelevant and prejudicial matter into the trial. Counsel for petitioner then filed an affidavit in answer supporting petitioner's allegation of errors.\n\nThe District Court refused the request for a transcript of the trial record and denied the application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis on the ground that the appeal was \"not taken in good faith\" because it was \"frivolous and without merit\" and \"[t]he evidence amply supported the verdict.\" Petitioner then asked the Court of Appeals for permission to appeal in forma pauperis but that court denied his request indicating that his claimed errors were without substance. 242 F.2d 338. And see 238 F.2d 575.\n\nAs things now stand conflicting affidavits have been introduced concerning petitioner's contention of errors at the trial. If the allegations made by petitioner and his counsel are correct then it seems quite clear to us that his appeal cannot be characterized as frivolous. Before his allegation of errors can be accurately evaluated, however, to ascertain if they do have any merit he should be furnished with a transcript of the trial record - unless counsel can agree on a statement of the relevant facts or some other means are devised to make the minutes of the trial available to petitioner - so that he has an opportunity to substantiate his allegations and point out their significance and so that they can be appraised on a dependable \n\n[354 \nU.S. 521, 523]\n\u00a0\n record. Cf. Johnson v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 565\n. In our judgment petitioner has not yet been afforded an adequate opportunity to show the Court of Appeals that his claimed errors are not frivolous so as to enable that court to review properly the District Court's certification that the appeal was in bad faith.

MOORE-McCORMACK LINES(1957)\nNo. 59\nArgued: December 10, 1956Decided: February 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, an employee on a passenger ship of respondent, was injured in the course of his employment while using a sharp butcher knife to remove ice cream from a container in which it was frozen hard. In an action under the Jones Act, under which the standard of liability is that of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the Federal District Court entered judgment on a jury verdict awarding damages to petitioner. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a motion for a directed verdict for respondent should have been granted. This Court granted certiorari. Held: There was sufficient evidence to take to the jury the question whether respondent was negligent in failing to furnish petitioner an adequate tool with which to perform his task, and the judgment is reversed. Pp. 521-524.\n\n 228 F.2d 891, reversed.\n\nGeorge J. Engelman argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nWilliam A. Wilson argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Wilbur E. Dow, Jr. and Frederick Fish.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join.\n\nPetitioner was injured in 1950 while serving as a second baker on respondent's passenger ship Brazil. Among his duties, he was required to fill orders of the ship's waiters for ice cream. On the day of the accident, he had received an order from a ship's waiter for 12 portions of ice cream. When he got half way down in the two-and-one-half-gallon ice-cream container from which he was \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 522]\n\u00a0\n filling these orders, the ice cream was so hard that it could not be removed with the hemispherical scoop with which he had been furnished. Petitioner undertook to remove the ice cream with a sharp butcher knife kept nearby, grasping the handle and chipping at the hard ice cream. The knife struck a spot in the ice cream which was so hard that his hand slipped down onto the blade of the knife, resulting in the loss of two fingers of his right hand.\n\nPetitioner brought this suit under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. 688, to recover for his injuries, which were alleged to be the result of respondent's negligence. At the close of petitioner's case, respondent's motion for a directed verdict was denied. Respondent offered no evidence. After the jury returned a verdict of $17,500 for the petitioner, respondent moved to set aside the verdict. This motion was also denied and judgment entered for the petitioner in accordance with the jury verdict. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that it was \"not within the realm of reasonable foreseeability\" that petitioner would use the knife to chip the frozen ice cream. 228 F.2d 891, 892. We granted certiorari. \n351 \nU.S. 936\n.\n\nWe conclude that there was sufficient evidence to take to the jury the question whether respondent was negligent in failing to furnish petitioner with an adequate tool with which to perform his task.\n\nPetitioner testified that the hard ice cream could have been loosened safely with an ice chipper. He had used such an instrument for that purpose on other ships. He was not, however, furnished such an instrument. There was evidence that the scoop with which he had been furnished was totally inadequate to remove ice cream of the consistency of that which he had to serve. And, there was evidence that its extremely hard consistency was produced by the failure of another member of the crew \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 523]\n\u00a0\n to transfer it from the deep freeze to a tempering chest in sufficient time to allow all of it to become disposable by means of the scoop when the time came for it to be served. There was no showing that any device was close at hand which would have safely performed the task. Finally, there was evidence that petitioner had been instructed to give the waiters prompt service.\n\nRespondent urges that it was not reasonably foreseeable that petitioner would utilize the knife to loosen the ice cream. But the jury, which plays a pre-eminent role in these Jones Act cases (Jacob v. New York City, \n315 \nU.S. 752\n; Schulz v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n350 \nU.S. 523\n), could conclude that petitioner had been furnished no safe tool to perform his task. It was not necessary that respondent be in a position to foresee the exact chain of circumstances which actually led to the accident. The jury was instructed that it might consider whether respondent could have anticipated that a knife would be used to get out the ice cream. On this record, fair-minded men could conclude that respondent should have foreseen that petitioner might be tempted to use a knife to perform his task with dispatch, since no adequate implement was furnished him. See Schulz v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n350 \nU.S. 523, 526\n. Since the standard of liability under the Jones Act is that established by Congress under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, what we said in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., ante, p. 500, decided this day, is relevant here:\n\n \"Under this statute the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.\"\n\n\n Because the jury could have so concluded, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondent's motion for a directed verdict should have been granted. \"Courts \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 524]\n\u00a0\n should not assume that in determining these questions of negligence juries will fall short of a fair performance of their constitutional function.\" Wilkerson v. McCarthy, \n336 \nU.S. 53, 62\n.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON concurs in the result.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n \"The Federal Employers Liability Act gives to  railroad employees a somewhat liberalized right  of recovery for injuries on the job. A great number  of cases under the Act have been brought to  the Supreme Court, many of them cases in  which the court of appeals had set aside, on the  evidence, verdicts for the employees. Despite  the human appeal of these cases, Brandeis never  allowed himself to regard them as the proper  business of the appellate jurisdiction of the  Supreme Court.\"\n\n\n  Paul A. Freund, The Liberalism of   Justice Brandeis, address at a meeting of   the American Historical Association in   St. Louis, December 28, 1956.\n\n\n In so discharging his judicial responsibility, Mr. Justice Brandeis did not disclose an idiosyncrasy in a great judge. His attitude expressed respect for the standards \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 525]\n\u00a0\n formulated by the Court in carrying out the mandate of Congress regarding this Court's appellate jurisdiction in cases arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. For he began his work on the Court\n1\n just after Congress had passed the Act of September 6, 1916, 39 Stat. 726, relieving the Court of its obligatory jurisdiction over Federal Employers' Liability Act decisions by the highest state courts and the Circuit Courts of Appeals. Mr. Justice Brandeis' general outlook on the formulation by the Supreme Court of the public law appropriate for an evolving society has more and more prevailed; his concept of the role of the Supreme Court in our judicial system, and his consequent regard for the bearing on the judicial product of what business comes to the Court and how the Court deals with it, have often been neglected in the name of \"doing justice\" in individual cases. To him these were not technicalities, in the derogatory sense, for the conduct of judicial business. He deemed wise decisions on substantive law within the indispensable area of the Court's jurisdiction dependent on a limited volume of business and on a truly deliberative process.\n\nOne field of conspicuous disregard of these vital considerations is that large mass of cases under the Federal Employers' Liability Act in which the sole issue is the sufficiency of the evidence for submission to the jury.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 526]\n\u00a0\n For many years, I reluctantly voted on the merits of these negligence cases that had been granted review. In the last ten years, and more particularly within the past few years, as the Court has been granting more and more of these petitions, I have found it increasingly difficult to acquiesce in a practice that I regard as wholly incompatible with the certiorari policy embodied in the 1916 Act, the Judiciary Act of 1925, 43 Stat. 936, and the Rules formulated by the Court to govern certiorari jurisdiction for its own regulation and for the guidance of the bar. I have therefore felt compelled to vote to dismiss petitions for certiorari in such cases as improvidently granted without passing on the merits.\n3\n In these cases I indicated briefly the reasons why I believed that this Court should not be reviewing decisions in which the sole issue is the sufficiency of the evidence for submission to the jury. In view of the increasing number of these cases that have been brought here for review - this dissent is to four decisions of the Court - and in view of the encouragement thereby given to continuing resort to this Court, I deem it necessary to enlarge upon the considerations that have guided me in the conviction that writs in this class of cases are \"improvidently granted.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 527]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the outset, however, I should deal briefly with a preliminary problem. It is sometimes said that the \"integrity of the certiorari process\" as expressed in the \"rule of four\" (that is, this Court's practice of granting certiorari on the vote of four Justices) requires all the Justices to vote on the merits of a case when four Justices have voted to grant certiorari and no new factor emerges after argument and deliberation. There are two reasons why there can be no such requirement. Last Term, for example, the Court disposed of 1,361 petitions for certiorari. With such a volume of certiorari business, not to mention the remainder of the Court's business, the initial decision to grant a petition for certiorari must necessarily be based on a limited appreciation of the issues in a case. resting as it so largely does on the partisan claims in briefs of counsel. See Furness, Withy & Co. v. Yang-Tsze Ins. Assn., \n242 \nU.S. 430, 434\n; Southern Power Co. v. North Carolina Public Service Co., \n263 \nU.S. 508, 509\n. The court does not, indeed it cannot and should not try to, give to the initial question of granting or denying a petition the kind of attention that is demanded by a decision on the merits. The assumption that we know no more after hearing and deliberating on a case than after reading the petition for certiorari and the response is inadmissible in theory and not true in fact. Even an FELA case sometimes appears in quite a different light after argument than it appeared on the original papers. Surely this must be acknowledged regarding one of today's cases, No. 46, and see McCarthy v. Bruner, certiorari granted, \n322 \nU.S. 718\n, certiorari dismissed. \n323 \nU.S. 673\n. The course of argument and the briefs on the merits may disclose that a case appearing on the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 528]\n\u00a0\n surface to warrant a writ of certiorari does not warrant it, see Layne & Bowler Corp. v. Western Well Works, Inc., \n261 \nU.S. 387\n,\n5\n or may reveal more clearly that the only thing in controversy is an appraisal of facts on which this Court is being asked to make a second guess, to substitute its assessment of the testimony for that of the court below.\n\nBut there is a more basic reason why the \"integrity of the certiorari process\" does not require me to vote on the merits of these cases. The right of a Justice to dissent from an action of the Court is historic. Of course self-restraint should guide the expression of dissent. But dissent is essential to an effective judiciary in a democratic society, and especially for a tribunal exercising the powers of this Court. Not four, not eight, Justices can require another to decide a case that he regards as not properly before the Court. The failure of a Justice to persuade his colleagues does not require him to yield to their views, if he has a deep conviction that the issue is sufficiently important. Moreover, the Court operates ultimately by majority. Even though a minority may bring a case here for oral argument, that does not mean that the majority has given up its right to vote on the ultimate disposition of the case as conscience directs. This is not a novel doctrine. As a matter of practice, members of the Court have at various times exercised this right of refusing to pass on the merits of cases that in their view should not have been granted review.\n\nThis does not make the \"rule of four\" a hollow rule. I would not change the practice. No Justice is likely to vote to dismiss a writ of certiorari as improvidently granted after argument has been heard, even though he has not been convinced that the case is within the rules of the Court governing the granting of certiorari. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 529]\n\u00a0\n In the usual instance, a doubting Justice respects the judgment of his brethren that the case does concern issues important enough for the Court's consideration and adjudication. But a different situation is presented when a class of cases is systematically taken for review. Then a Justice who believes that such cases raise insignificant and unimportant questions - insignificant and unimportant from the point of view of the Court's duties - and that an increasing amount of the Court's time is unduly drained by adjudication of these cases cannot forego his duty to voice his dissent to the Court's action.\n\nThe \"rule of four\" is not a command of Congress. It is working rule devised by the Court as a practical mode of determining that a case is deserving of review, the theory being that if four Justices find that a legal question of general importance is raised, that is ample proof that the question has such importance. This is a fair enough rule of thumb on the assumption that four Justices find such importance on an individualized screening of the cases sought to be reviewed. The reason for deference to a minority view no longer holds when a class of litigation is given a special and privileged position.\n\nThe history of the Federal Employers' Liability Act reveals the continuing nature of the problem of review by this Court of the vast litigation under that Act in both the federal and state courts. The initial Federal Employers' Liability Act, 34 Stat. 232, was declared unconstitutional in the first Employers' Liability Cases, \n207 \nU.S. 463\n. The second Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, drafted to meet the constitutional infirmity found in the first Act, was sustained in the Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1\n. Under the general statutory scheme of review of litigation by the Supreme Court in force at that time, all cases arising \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 530]\n\u00a0\n under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, whether coming from the state or federal courts, were reviewable in the Supreme Court by writ of error, that is, as a matter of right. After the constitutionality of the Act had been sustained, cases began to flow to the Supreme Court and within a few years the Court was threatened with an avalanche of litigation under the Act. In the 1915 Term, the Court delivered opinions in 19 cases involving an assessment of the evidence to determine whether submission to the jury was warranted. See Appendices A and B, and starred footnote to Appendix A, post, pp. 548, 549.\n\nTo relieve the Court of this burden of reviewing the large volume of insignificant litigation under the Federal Employers' Liability Act was one of the principal reasons for passage of the Act of September 6, 1916, 39 Stat. 726. See S. Rep. No. 775, 64th Cong., 1st Sess.; H.R. Rep. No. 794, 64th Cong., 1st Sess. In thus freeing the Court from unrestricted access to it of cases that have no business here, Congress assimilated Federal Employers' Liability Act litigation to those other categories of cases - e. g., diversity, patent, admiralty, criminal cases - that Congress had in 1891, 26 Stat. 826, 828, withdrawn from this Court's obligatory jurisdiction. Believing review in the state appellate systems or in the newly created Circuit Courts of Appeals sufficient, it made the lower courts' decisions final also in this class of litigation in all but the unusual cases raising significant legal questions. Thereafter such cases could be reviewed by the Supreme Court only on certiorari to \"secure uniformity of decision\" between the Circuit Courts of Appeals and \"to bring up cases involving questions of importance which it is in the public interest to have decided by this Court of last resort. The jurisdiction was not conferred upon this Court merely to give the defeated party in the Circuit Court of Appeals another hearing. . . . These remarks, of course, apply \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 531]\n\u00a0\n also to applications for certiorari to review judgments and decrees of the highest courts of States.\" Magnum Co. v. Coty, \n262 \nU.S. 159, 163\n-164. (See also Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers & Co., \n240 \nU.S. 251, 257\n-258: certiorari jurisdiction \"is a jurisdiction to be exercised sparingly, and only in cases of peculiar gravity and general importance, or in order to secure uniformity of decision.\") The statement for the Court by Mr. Chief Justice Taft in the Coty case indicates the strict criteria governing certiorari policy observed by the Court, except occasionally in FELA cases, previous to the Act of 1925, by which Congress put the Court's docket for all practical purposes in its own keeping. (For a more detailed history of the origin of certiorari jurisdiction, see Frankfurter and Landis, Business of The Supreme Court. cc. II, III, V, and VII.)\n\nThe vast extension of discretionary review by the Supreme Court on writ of certiorari contained in the Judges Bill of 1925, 43 Stat. 936, led the Court to promulgate formal rules, and not rely on admonitions in opinions. regarding conditions under which petitions for certiorari would be granted. The present Rule 19 of the Revised Rules of the Supreme Court contains the substance of the original Rule 35 (5) of the Revised Rules of 1925, \n266 \nU.S. 645, 681\n, and perhaps in view of the issue in these cases it is not unwarranted to set forth the full text of that rule:\n\n  \"1. A review on writ of certiorari is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion, and will be granted only where there are special and important reasons therefor. The following, while neither controlling nor fully measuring the court's discretion, indicate the character of reasons which will be considered:\n\n\n  \"(a) Where a state court has decided a federal question of substance not theretofore determined by \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 532]\n\u00a0\n this court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord with applicable decisions of this court.\n\n\n  \"(b) Where a court of appeals has rendered a decision in conflict with the decision of another court of appeals on the same matter; or has decided an important state or territorial question in a way in conflict with applicable state or territorial law; or has decided an important question of federal law which has not been, but should be, settled by this court; or has decided a federal question in a way in conflict with applicable decisions of this court; or has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such a departure by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of this court's power of supervision.\n\n\n  \"2. The same general considerations outlined above will control in respect of petitions for writs of certiorari to review judgments of the Court of Claims, of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, or of any other court whose determinations are by law reviewable on writ of certiorari.\"\n\n\n Of course, cases raising questions that are not evidentiary, questions that fairly involve the construction or scope of the statute are appropriate for review here. See, e. g., Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Bombolis, \n241 \nU.S. 211\n; Southern Pacific Co. v. Gileo, \n351 \nU.S. 493\n; Reed v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n351 \nU.S. 502\n. But the ordinary negligence case under the Federal Employers' Liability Act does not satisfy the criteria that define the \"special and important reasons\" when a writ of certiorari will be granted, and this may perhaps best be appreciated by summarizing the course of proceedings in each of the four cases now before us.\n\nIn No. 28, the petitioner brought suit for damages, alleging negligence on the part of respondent railroad in providing an unsafe place to work and an unsafe method \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 533]\n\u00a0\n for doing his work. Petitioner was engaged in burning weeds on respondent's right of way with a hand torch. He heard a whistle indicating an approaching train. He ran thirty to thirty-five yards along the track from the fire and, thinking himself far enough from the fire danger, stood near a drainage culvert watching the passing train for \"hotboxes.\" The train caused the fire to come \"right up in [his] face.\" Petitioner backed away with his arm over his face and fell down the incline of the culvert. There was considerable testimony concerning the circumstances of the accident, the methods of burning weeds, the duties of railroad workers, the condition of the right of way, in particular the condition of the culvert, and petitioner's knowledge of those conditions. Respondent's motions for a directed verdict at the close of petitioner's case and at the close of all the evidence were denied. The case was submitted to the jury, which returned a verdict for petitioner.\n\nOn appeal, the Missouri Supreme Court reversed. 284 S. W. 2d 467. Considering the evidence from a standpoint most favorable to the petitioner, it held that there was insufficient evidence of negligence on the part of respondent, and that even if there were sufficient evidence of negligence, there was no evidence to show that such negligence contributed to petitioner's injury.\n\nIn No. 42, petitioner brought suit for injuries suffered as a result of respondent railroad's alleged failure to use ordinary care in furnishing him with a reasonably safe place to work. There was little dispute over the circumstances of the accident, which are set forth in the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 228 F.2d 257, 258:\n\n  \"Plaintiff had been employed by defendant in various capacities since about 1925 and was, on July 2, 1952, when the accident occurred, working as a brakeman, being assigned to the crew of a local \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 534]\n\u00a0\n freight run between the cities of East St. Louis and Clinton, Illinois. During the course of his duties, in a switching operation at Mount Olive, he noticed that a wheat car in the train was leaking. While the other crew members continued with the task of picking up cars to be incorporated into the train, he started back to the caboose to get some waste to plug the hole in the leaking car. He turned and, on the first step he took, tripped and fell with his left leg buckled under him. He thereby sustained a serious injury to his left kneecap. The accident occurred on the roadbed of defendant's `house track' at a point about one foot from the end of the ties. After plaintiff fell, he looked to see what had caused him to fall and saw a clinker `about the size of my fist' which was partly out of the ground, and a hole beside the clinker. . . . Plaintiff stated that he looked `at the ground' before he stepped but did not see the clinker. He stated further that the footing on the roadbed looked level but was a little soft.\"\n\n\n Defendant's motions for a directed verdict at the close of petitioner's case and at the close of all the evidence were denied, and the jury returned a verdict for petitioner. The Court of Appeals reversed. It held that the possibility that \"defendant placed the clinker in its roadbed as a part of the ballast used in the repair operation is merely one of several possibilities present. A finding that it did so can rest on nothing but speculation.\" The Court of Appeals also stated that \"there is a total want of evidence as to what constitutes reasonable prudence under the proved circumstances,\" and that the record \"is equally lacking in evidence to prove that defendant had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition.\" Id., at 259, 260.\n\nIn No. 46, petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit from a directed verdict for respondent \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 535]\n\u00a0\n railroad. He gave the only testimony with respect to the accident and testified that, while the train was proceeding slowly, it made a sudden stop which threw him to the floor of the caboose where he was riding. The official report of the accident, which he signed, stated that the stop was made to avoid striking an automobile at a grade crossing. Petitioner gave some further testimony about the operation of air brakes, the frequency of emergency braking in his experience, and other methods of slowing down the train than by emergency braking. On this record, the Court of Appeals found a complete absence of probative facts to warrant submission of the case to the jury, and it affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 228 F.2d 902.\n\nNo. 59 was an appeal under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. 688, whose standard of liability is explicitly that of the Federal Employers' Liability Act in this type of case; this case therefore presents the same problem for the Court as the other three. Petitioner had obtained a judgment, which was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for failure of proof of negligence. The facts and reasons for reversal are set forth in the opinion of that court:\n\n  \"Plaintiff was a baker engaged at the time of the  accident in serving ice cream in the galley on C deck  of defendant's SS Brazil. Using the standard ice  cream scoop provided for the purpose, plaintiff disposed  of the contents of a half used tub and had  worked his way about half way down a full additional  tub. There he found the ice cream `as hard as a  brickbat,' and the scoop became useless. So it occurred  to plaintiff that about a foot and a half from  where he was serving and `kept underneath the griddle'  was a butcher knife, about eighteen inches long  and as sharp as a razor, which might be used to chip  the ice cream into small pieces. He was chipping \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 536]\n\u00a0\n  away when his hand slipped and he was badly cut,  resulting later in the loss of two fingers of his right  hand.\n\n\n  \". . . The negligence [of defendant] is supposed  to stem from a failure to provide a safe place to work  and safe tools and appliances. Reliance is also placed  upon the fact that plaintiff had been directed to fill  the orders brought into the galley by the waiters and  it is said that there must have been something wrong  with the refrigeration system or the ice cream would  not have been so hard.\n\n\n  \"But no one in authority told plaintiff to use the  butcher knife, which was customarily used in cutting  French bread. The knife was properly in the galley  and there was nothing defective about it. But it  was never designed for or intended to be used as a  dagger or ice pick for chipping frozen ice cream. And  that it would be put to such use was not within the  realm of reasonable foreseeability . . . .\n\n\n  \"There being no proof of fault on the part of the  shipowner, defendant's motion for a directed verdict  should have been granted.\" 228 F.2d 891.\n\n\n In all good conscience, what \"special and important\" reason for granting certiorari do the facts in any one of these cases disclose? In three of them, the trial judge had allowed a case to go to the jury, and three unanimous reviewing courts - two Courts of Appeals and one state Supreme Court - had reversed for lack of evidence. In each of these cases, this Court has combed the record and found that there was sufficient evidence for the case to go to the jury, although in No. 28 the Court found evidence of negligence in the fact that \"[c]ommon experience\" teaches \"that a passing train will fan the flames of a fire,\" whereas in No. 46 the Court found insufficiency of evidence to go to the jury because \"there is no evidence to \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 537]\n\u00a0\n show that unscheduled and sudden stops of trains are unusual or extraordinary occurrences.\" In No. 46, the Court therefore affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which had affirmed the direction of a verdict for defendant.\n\nIn any event, the Court in these four cases has merely reviewed evidence that has already been reviewed by two lower courts, and in so doing it ignores its own strictures to the bar that \"We do not grant a certiorari to review evidence and discuss specific facts.\" United States v. Johnston, \n268 \nU.S. 220, 227\n. See also Houston Oil Co. v. Goodrich, \n245 \nU.S. 440\n; Southern Power Co. v. North Carolina Public Service Co., \n263 \nU.S. 508\n; General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co., \n304 \nU.S. 175, 178\n. Constant complaints have been made by successive Chief Justice about the large number of frivolous petitions that are filed each Term, \"frivolous\" meaning that the issues are not deserving of consideration for review when judged by the Court's instructions to the bar. See the remarks of Chief Justice Taft, in 35 Yale L. J. 1, 3-4; Chief Justice Hughes, in 20 A. B. A. J. 341; Chief Justice Vinson, in 69 S. Ct. V, VI-VII. If the Court does not abide by its Rules, how can it expect the bar to do so? Standards must be enforced to be respected. If they are merely left as something on paper, they might as well be written on water.\n\nThe rule that the Court does not grant certiorari to review evidence is a wise rule, indeed indispensable to the work of the Court, and is as equally applicable to negligence cases as to any other type of case. Perhaps a word should be said about the basis of the cause of action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Liability under the Act is based on negligence.\n6\n As far as the substantive \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 538]\n\u00a0\n cause of action is concerned, this is the historic cause of action for negligence as it has developed from the common law. It involves the same general concept on which is based every \"negligence case\" in the state courts and in the multitudinous cases in the federal courts on diversity of citizenship in which the question is merely one of common-law negligence; that is, it is the familiar type of litigation that is part of the day-to-day business of state and federal trial judges.\n\nThe 1908 Act denied the railroads the benefit of certain common-law defenses and the 1939 amendment, 53 Stat. 1404, abolished the defense of assumption of risk, but the fact that a right to recover is not barred by what theretofore was a defense does not change the basis of the right. This has been recognized in the opinions of this Court in which it has reversed lower courts on the question of the sufficiency of the evidence. The Court has never intimated that the concept of negligence, undefined in the statute, has some special or esoteric content as used in the Act or is anything other than a statutory absorption of the common-law concept.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n\"One's deep sympathy is of course aroused by a victim of the hazards of negligence litigation in situations like the one before us. But the remedy for an obsolete and uncivilized system of compensation for loss of life or limb of crews on ships and trains is not intermittent disregard of the considerations which led Congress to entrust this Court with the discretion of certiorari jurisdiction. The remedy is an adequate and effective system of workmen's \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 539]\n\u00a0\n compensation,\" adequate in amount and especially prompt in administration. McAllister v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 19, 23\n-24 (separate opinion). It deserves to be recorded that Professor John Chipman Gray, a legal scholar with social insight, taught his students fifty years ago, before the first workmen's compensation law had been enacted, that it is anachronistic to apply the common-law doctrine of negligence to injuries suffered by railroad employees rather than have society recognize such injuries as inevitable incidents of railroading and provide compensation on that basis. The persistence of this archaic and cruel system is attributable to many factors. Inertia of course. But also it is merely one illustration of the lag of reform because of the opposition of lawyers who resist change of the familiar, particularly when they have thriven under some outworn doctrine of law.\n8\n Finally, one cannot acquit the encouragement given by this Court for seeking success in the lottery of obtaining heavy verdicts of contributing to the continuance of this system of compensation whose \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 540]\n\u00a0\n essential injustice can hardly be alleviated by the occasional \"correction\" in this Court of ill-success.\n\n\n Rather than paraphrase, I shall repeat what I have already said about negligence cases and certiorari policy in Wilkerson v. McCarthy, \n336 \nU.S. 53, 64\n, 66: \"Considering the volume and complexity of the cases which obviously call for decision by this Court, and considering the time and thought that the proper disposition of such cases demands, I do not think we should take cases merely to review facts already canvassed by two and sometimes three courts even though those facts may have been erroneously appraised. The division in this Court would seem to demonstrate beyond peradventure that nothing is involved in this case except the drawing of allowable inferences from a necessarily unique set of circumstances. For this Court to take a case which turns merely on such an appraisal of evidence, however much hardship in the fallible application of an archaic system of compensation for injuries to railroad employees\n9\n may touch our private sympathy, is to deny due regard to the considerations which led the Court to ask and Congress to give the power to control the Court's docket. Such power carries with it the responsibility of granting review only in cases that demand adjudication on the basis of importance of the outcome merely to the parties is not enough. . . .\" See also Carter v. Atlanta & St. A. B. R. Co., \n338 \nU.S. 430, 437\n; McAllister v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 19, 23\n.\n\nThe Court finds justification for granting certiorari in an alleged conflict of these decisions of the Courts of Appeals for the Second, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits and the Supreme Court of Missouri with the applicable decisions \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 541]\n\u00a0\n of this Court. All that can fairly be said is that these courts found that there was not evidence to bring these cases within the recognized rules for submitting a case to the jury. In none of them is there any intimation or atmospheric indication of unwillingness to enforce the governing rules of the Act as laid down by this Court. These rules are well known. That there should be differences of opinion in their application is almost inevitable.\n10\n But once Congress in 1916 commanded that the ordinary Federal Employers' Liability Act case, like other essentially private litigation, should reach a final decision in the Courts of Appeals or the state appellate tribunals, this Court should never have granted certiorari to assess the evidence in any of them.\n11\n I would not continue a bad practice to aid a few plaintiffs because there was once a bad practice that aided a few defendants. One still does not commit two wrongs to \"do right.\"\n\nThis is not the supreme court of review for every case decided \"unjustly\" by every court in the country. The \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 542]\n\u00a0\n Court's practice in taking these Federal Employers' Liability Act cases discriminates against other personal injury cases, for example those in the federal courts on diversity jurisdiction. Similar questions of negligence are involved there and the opportunity for swallowing up more of the Supreme Court's energy is very great indeed. While 1,332 cases were commenced under the Federal Employers' Liability Act in the Federal District Courts in the fiscal year 1956 and 2,392 cases under the Jones Act, 11,427 personal injury cases were begun under the diversity jurisdiction in the District Courts. Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts - 1956, pp. 52-53. The Court may well have had this discrimination in mind when it granted certiorari in the diversity case of Gibson v. Phillips Petroleum Co., \n352 \nU.S. 874\n, and decided it on the merits. A few more such decisions and a flood of petitions from this source may confidently be expected. Whether or not it be true that we are a litigious people, it is a matter of experience that clients, if not lawyers, have a strong urge to exhaust all possibility of further appeal, particularly when judicially encouraged to do so. Disappointed litigants and losing lawyers like to have another go at it, and why should they not try when certiorari was granted in cases like these?\n\nIt is not enough, however, to deal with this problem on an abstract, theoretical basis. The statistical history of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, as set forth in the tables in the appendices to this opinion, gives concrete evidence of the recurring nature of the problem and the time-consuming nature of the litigation. In the early years of the Act, when review by this Court was on writ of error, there was a large number of cases in which sufficiency of evidence was at issue. Contrary to general belief, however, employees fared well in this type of case. Of the 42 cases decided by the Court raising that issue, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 543]\n\u00a0\n a judgment for the plaintiff was reversed for evidentiary reasons in only three cases and a judgment for the defendant railroad upheld in only seven. In the other 32 cases, judgments for plaintiffs were affirmed or judgments for defendants reversed.\n\nOnce easy access to this Court was shut off by the discretionary power of review over these cases that was given to the Court in 1916, few FELA decisions were rendered, and only four, of which one was on writ of error, dealing with the sufficiency of the evidence, in the five-year period covered by the 1918 through the 1922 Terms. During the next ten years, however, the Court concerned itself more and more with the Act, but during this era the railroads tended to prevail. Thirty-five decisions were rendered from the 1923 Term through the 1932 Term. In 27 of these a judgment for a plaintiff was reversed for evidentiary reasons; in another the Court affirmed the reversal of a judgment for a plaintiff; and in another the Court reversed the reversal of a directed verdict for a railroad. (For a review of certiorari policy under the FELA during this period, see Frankfurter and Landis, Business of the Supreme Court at October Term, 1931, 46 Harv. L. Rev. 226, 240-253.)\n\nThereafter, during the remaining eight Terms of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, the number of sufficiency-of-the-evidence cases under the Act that were granted review fell off considerably. Only seven decisions were rendered during that period. The next nine-year period, however, saw a large increase again, with 27 decisions during the 1941 through 1949 Terms. Unlike the previous experience with the Act, it was not efforts of railroads seeking to reverse judgments in favor of injured workers that constituted the major portion of the business during this period, but rather efforts by injured workers to upset judgments for railroads. And they were successful. Judgments for railroads were sustained in only four \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 544]\n\u00a0\n cases. In all the others, the Court reversed a judgment of a lower court that either had reversed a jury verdict for a plaintiff or had affirmed a judgment for a railroad.\n\nIn the following four Terms, business again slackened and only two cases concerning sufficiency of the evidence were decided under the Act. We now seem to have entered again on a period of renewed activity by the Court in this field. Two decisions were rendered in the 1954 Term, three in the 1955 Term, four thus far this Term, and two additional petitions for certiorari have already been granted this Term.\n\nA further indication of the tendency in recent Court decisions is provided by a study of petitions for certiorari in FELA cases from the 1938 through the 1954 Terms. This study disclosed that of the 260 petitions filed, sufficiency of the evidence of negligence or of causation for submission to the jury was the predominant question in 149. Seventy-eight of these petitions were filed by the employee and all of the 37 granted petitions were from this group, except one in which the writ was later dismissed as improvidently granted. McCarthy v. Bruner, certiorari granted, \n322 \nU.S. 718\n, certiorari dismissed, \n323 \nU.S. 673\n. Certiorari Policy in FELA Cases, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1441, 1445-1446.\n\nThese figures tell only a small part of the story. While this opinion concerns itself principally with cases under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the same kind of question arises under many other statutes. See footnote 2, supra. And experience leaves no doubt, though the fact cannot be established statistically, that by granting review in these cases, the Court encourages the filing of petitions for certiorari in other types of cases raising issues that likewise have no business to be brought here. Moreover, the considerations governing discharge of the Court's function involve only in part quantitative factors. Finally, and most important, granting review in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 545]\n\u00a0\n one or two cases that present a compassionate appeal on this ground and one or two that present a compassionate appeal on that ground and one or two that present a compassionate appeal on a third ground inevitably makes that drain upon the available energy of the Court that is so inimical to the fullest investigation of, the amplest deliberation on, the most effective opinion-writing and the most critical examination of draft opinions in, the cases that have unquestioned claims upon the Court.\n\nIt is impossible to read the 106 written opinions of the Supreme Court dealing with this type of issue, see Appendices A and B, without feeling that during different periods the Court, while using the same generalities in speaking about the relation of judge and jury to the cause of action for negligence, has applied those principles differently from time to time to the facts of different cases. The divided views on this Court today with respect to the application of those principles merely reflect the divided views of state and federal judges throughout the country on problems of negligence. As long as there is a division of functions between judge and jury, there will be division of opinion concerning the correctness of trial judges' actions in individual cases. But since the law obviously does not remain \"settled\" in this field very long, one does not have to be a prophet to be confident that the Court, if it continues its present certiorari policy, will one day return to its attitude of the 1920's in these individual cases. With a changed membership, the Court might tomorrow readily affirm all four of the cases that it decides today. There is nothing in the Federal Employers' Liability Act to say which view is correct. The Act expressed a social policy, and it expressed that policy in terms of a familiar, but elusively inapt, common-law cause of action. It is suggested in effect that the history of FELA litigation in this Court reveals a shift in mood, philosophy if one pleases, towards the Federal Employers' Liability Act - \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 546]\n\u00a0\n that at one time the chief concern may be lively regard for what are conceived to be unfair inroads upon the railroads' exchequer\n12\n while at another period the preoccupation may be with protection of employees and their families, so far as money damages can do so, against the inherent hazards of their indispensable labor. Be that as it may, the desire to engraft a philosophy, either philosophy, upon an outmoded, unfair system of liability should not lead the Court to bend the rules by which it is governed in other cases in the exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction.\n\nThis unvarnished account of Federal Employers' Liability Act litigation in this Court relating to sufficiency of the evidence for submission of cases to the jury is surely not an exhilarating story. For the Supreme Court of the United States to spend two hours of solemn argument, plus countless other hours reading the briefs and record and writing opinions, to determine whether there was evidence to support an allegation that it could reasonably be foreseen that an ice-cream server on a ship would use a butcher's knife to scoop out ice cream that was too hard to be scooped with a regular scoop, is surely to misconceive the discretion that was entrusted to the wisdom of the Court for the control of its calendar. The Court may or may not be \"doing justice\" in the four insignificant cases it decides today; it certainly is doing injustice to the significant and important cases on the calendar and to its own role as the supreme judicial body of the country.\n\nIt is, I believe, wholly accurate to say that the Court will be enabled to discharge adequately the vital, and, I feel, the increasingly vital, responsibility it bears for the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 547]\n\u00a0\n general welfare only if it restricts its reviewing power to the adjudication of constitutional issues or other questions of national importance, including therein settlement of conflict among the circuits. Surely it was this conviction, born of experience, that led the Court to ask of Congress that of the great mass of litigation in the state and federal courts only those cases should be allowed to be brought here that this Court deemed fit for review. Such was the jurisdictional policy accepted by Congress when it yielded to the Court's realization of the conditions necessary for its proper functioning.\n\nFor one thing, as the current United States Reports compared with those of even a generation ago amply prove, the types of cases now calling for decision to a considerable extent require investigation of voluminous literature far beyond the law reports and other legal writings. If it is to yield its proper significance, this vast mass of materials, often confused and conflicting, must be passed through the sieve of reflection. Judicial reflection is a process that requires time and freedom from the pressure of having more work to do than can be well done. It is not a bit of quixotism to believe that, of the 63 cases scheduled for argument during the remaining months of this Term, there are a half dozen that could alone easily absorb the entire thought of the Court for the rest of the Term.\n\nThe judgments of this Court are collective judgments. Such judgments are especially dependent on ample time for private study and reflection in preparation for discussion in Conference. Without adequate study, there cannot be adequate reflection; without adequate reflection, there cannot be adequate discussion; without adequate discussion, there cannot be that full and fruitful interchange of minds that is indispensable to wise decisions and persuasive opinions by the Court. Unless the Court vigorously enforces its own criteria for granting review of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 548]\n\u00a0\n cases, it will inevitably face an accumulation of arrears or will dispose of its essential business in too hurried and therefore too shallow a way.\n\nI would dismiss all four writs of certiorari as improvidently granted.\n\n[For opinion of MR.

JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in No. 46 and dissenting in Nos. 28, 42 and 59.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nI am in full agreement with what my Brother FRANKFURTER has written in criticism of the Court's recurring willingness to grant certiorari in cases of this type. For the reasons he has given, I think the Court should not have heard any of these four cases. Nevertheless, the cases having been taken, I have conceived it to be my duty to consider them on their merits, because I cannot reconcile voting to dismiss the writs as \"improvidently granted\" with the Court's \"rule of four.\" In my opinion due adherence to that rule requires that once certiorari has been granted a case should be disposed of on the premise that it is properly here, in the absence of considerations appearing which were not manifest or fully apprehended at the time certiorari was granted. In these instances I am unable to say that such considerations exist, even though I do think that the arguments on the merits underscored the views of those of us who originally felt that the cases should not be taken because they involved only issues of fact, and presented nothing of sufficient general importance to warrant this substantial expenditure of the Court's time.\n\nI do not think that, in the absence of the considerations mentioned, voting to dismiss a writ after it has been granted can be justified on the basis of an inherent right of dissent. In the case of a petition for certiorari that right, it seems to me - again without the presence of intervening factors - is exhausted once the petition has \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 560]\n\u00a0\n been granted and the cause set for argument.\n1\n Otherwise the \"rule of four\" surely becomes a meaningless thing in more than one respect. First, notwithstanding the \"rule of four,\" five objecting Justices could undo the grant by voting, after the case has been heard, to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted - a course which would hardly be fair to litigants who have expended time, effort, and money on the assumption that their cases would be heard and decided on the merits. While in the nature of things litigants must assume the risk of \"improvidently granted\" dismissals because of factors not fully apprehended when the petition for certiorari was under consideration, short of that it seems to me that the Court would stultify its own rule if it were permissible for a writ of certiorari to be annulled by the later vote of five objecting Justices. Indeed, if that were proper, it would be preferable to have the vote of annulment come into play the moment after the petition for certiorari has been granted, since then at least the litigants would be spared useless effort in briefing and preparing for the argument of their cases. Second, permitting the grant of a writ to be thus undone would undermine the whole philosophy of the \"rule of four,\" which is that any case warranting consideration in the opinion of such a substantial minority of the Court will be taken and disposed of. It appears to me that such a practice would accomplish just the contrary of what representatives of this Court stated to Congress as to the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 561]\n\u00a0\n \"rule of four\" at the time the Court's certiorari jurisdiction was enlarged by the Judiciary Act of 1925.\n2\n In effect the \"rule of four\" would, by indirection, become a \"rule of five.\" Third, such a practice would, in my opinion, be inconsistent with the long-standing and desirable custom of not announcing the Conference vote on petitions for certiorari. For in the absence of the intervening circumstances which may cause a Justice to vote to dismiss a writ as improvidently granted, such a disposition of the case on his part is almost bound to be taken as reflecting his original Conference vote on the petition. And if such a practice is permissible, then by the same token I do not see how those who voted in favor of the petition can reasonably be expected to refrain from announcing their Conference votes at the time the petition is acted on.\n\nMy Brother FRANKFURTER states that the course he advocates will not result in making of the \"rule of four\" an empty thing, suggesting that in individual cases \"a doubting Justice\" will normally respect \"the judgment of his brethren that the case does concern issues important enough for the Court's consideration and adjudication,\" and that it is only \"when a class of cases is systematically taken for review\" that such a Justice \"cannot forego his duty to voice his dissent to the Court's action.\" However, it seems to me that it is precisely in that type of situation where the exercise of the right of dissent may well result in nullification of the \"rule of four\" by the action of five Justices. For differences of view as to the desirability of the Court's taking particular \"classes\" of cases - the situation we have here - are prone to lead to more or less definite lines of cleavage among the Justices, which past experience has shown may well \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 562]\n\u00a0\n involve an alignment of four Justices who favor granting certiorari in such cases and five who do not. If in such situations it becomes the duty of one Justice among the disagreeing five not to \"forego\" his right to dissent, then I do not see why it is not equally the duty of the remaining four, resulting in the \"rule of four\" being set at naught. I thus see no basis in the circumstance that a case is an \"individual\" one rather than one of a \"class\" for distinctions in what may be done by an individual Justice who disapproves of the Court's action in granting certiorari.\n\nAlthough I feel strongly that cases of this kind do not belong in this Court, I can see no other course, consistent with the \"rule of four,\" but to continue our Conference debates, with the hope that persuasion or the mounting calendars of the Court will eventually bring our differing brethren to another point of view.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nSince I can find no intervening circumstances which would justify my voting now to dismiss the writs in these cases as improvidently granted, I turn to the merits of the four cases before us. I agree with, and join in, the Court's opinion in No. 46. I dissent in Nos. 28, 42 and 59. No doubt the evidence in the latter three cases can be viewed both as the three courts below did and as this Court does. So far as I can see all this Court has done is to substitute its views on the evidence for those of the Missouri Supreme Court and the two Courts of Appeals, and that is my first reason for dissenting. In my view we should not interfere with the decisions of these three courts in the absence of clear legal error, or some capricious or unreasonable action on their part. Nothing of that kind has been shown here. I would apply to cases of this type the reasoning of the Court in Labor Board v. Pittsburgh Steamship Co., \n340 \nU.S. 498\n, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 563]\n\u00a0\n 502-503, dealing with review of decisions of the National Labor Relations Board by the Courts of Appeals:\n\n \"Were we called upon to pass on the Board's conclusions in the first instance or to make an independent review of the review by the Court of Appeals, we might well support the Board's conclusion and reject that of the court below. But Congress has charged the Courts of Appeals and not this Court with [that] normal and primary responsibility . . . . The same considerations that should lead us to leave undisturbed, by denying certiorari, decisions of Courts of Appeals involving solely a fair assessment of a record on the issue of unsubstantiality, ought to lead us to do no more than decide that there was such a fair assessment when the case is here . . . .\n\n\n \"This is not the place to review a conflict of evidence nor to reverse a Court of Appeals because were we in its place we would find the record tilting one way rather than the other, though fair-minded judges could find it tilting either way.\"\n\n\n For my part, to overturn the judgments below simply involves second-guessing the Missouri Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, on questions of fact on which they brought to bear judgments neither capricious nor unreasonable, and on which they made a \"fair assessment of a record.\"\n\nI dissent also for another reason. No scientific or precise yardstick can be devised to test the sufficiency of the evidence in a negligence case. The problem has always been one of judgment, to be applied in view of the purposes of the statute. It has, however, been common ground that a verdict must be based on evidence - not on a scintilla of evidence but evidence sufficient to enable a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 521, 564]\n\u00a0\n reasoning man to infer both negligence and causation by reasoning from the evidence. Moore v. Chesapeake & O. R. Co., \n340 \nU.S. 573\n. And it has always been the function of the court to see to it that jury verdicts stay within that boundary, that they be arrived at by reason and not by will or sheer speculation. Neither the Seventh Amendment nor the Federal Employers' Liability Act lifted that duty from the courts. However, in judging these cases, the Court appears to me to have departed from these long-established standards, for, as I read these opinions, the implication seems to be that the question, at least as to the element of causation, is not whether the evidence is sufficient to convince a reasoning man, but whether there is any scintilla of evidence at all to justify the jury verdicts. I cannot agree with such a standard, for I consider it a departure from a wise rule of law, not justified either by the provision of the FELA making employers liable for injuries resulting \"in whole or in part\" from their negligence, or by anything else in the Act or its history, which evinces no purpose to depart in these respects from common-law rules.\n\nFor these reasons I think the judgments in Nos. 28, 42 and 59, as well as that in No. 46, should be affirmed.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON concurs in Part I of this opinion.\n\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE CLARK, and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur in Part I of this opinion except insofar as it disapproves of the grant of the writ of certiorari in these cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [NOTE: This dissenting opinion applies also to No. 28, Rogers v.

The term is the counterpart of the phrase \"improvidently taken,\" as used by Congress in 28 U.S.C. 2103, governing appeals from state courts that are improvidently taken.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See discussion of this point in Rice v.

To be sure, on the question of causality, the statute has tried to avoid issues about \"sole proximate cause,\" meeting the requirement of a causal relation with the language that the injury must result \"in whole or in part\" from the employer's negligence. See, e. g., Illinois Central R. Co. v. Skaggs, \n240 \nU.S. 66, 69\n-70.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Elihu Root's address to the American Bar Association in 1914: \"Lawyers are essentially conservative. They do not take kindly to change. They are not naturally reformers. Their time is occupied mainly in thinking and arguing about what the law of the particular case is; about what the facts of the case are. The most successful lawyers are, as a rule, continually engrossed in their own cases and they have little time and little respect for the speculative and hypothetical. The lawyers who have authority as leaders of opinion are men, as a rule, who have succeeded in their profession, and men naturally tend to be satisfied with the conditions under which they are succeeding.\" Root, Addresses on Government and Citizenship, 479, 484. See also Gibson, The Venue Clause and Transportation of Lawsuits, 18 Law and Contemporary Problems 367, for some statistics bearing on the interest of lawyers in the continuance of the present system. The author cites the example of one specialist in personal injury litigation whose administrator collected a minimum of $1,111,935 in fees from 150 lawsuits pending at the date of the lawyer's death.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] An archaic system, I might add, that encourages pursuit of big verdicts in individual cases, a preoccupation that has attained the dignity of full documentation of sensational methods by which a jury's feelings may be exploited.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] \"If there were a bright line dividing negligence from non-negligence, there would be no problem. Only an incompetent or a wilful judge would take a case from the jury when the issue should be left to the jury. But since questions of negligence are questions of degree, often very nice differences of degree, judges of competence and conscience have in the past, and will in the future, disagree as to whether proof in a case is sufficient to demand submission to the jury. The fact that a third court thinks there was enough to leave the case to the jury does not indicate that the other two courts were unmindful of the jury's function. The easy but timid way out for a trial judge is to leave all cases tried to a jury for jury determination, but in so doing he fails in his duty to take a case from the jury when the evidence would not warrant a verdict by it. A timid judge, like a biased judge, is intrinsically a lawless judge.\" Wilkerson v. McCarthy, \n336 \nU.S. 64, 65\n (concurring).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Any notion that the practice of directing verdicts offends the Seventh Amendment was laid to rest in Galloway v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 372\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] \"The cause is one of a peculiar class where we have frequently been obliged to give special consideration to the facts in order to protect interstate carriers against unwarranted judgments and enforce observance of the Liability Act as here interpreted.\" Atchison, T. & S.

It does not take into account other sufficiency-of-the-evidence cases, e. g., was an employee engaged in interstate commerce, that raise somewhat different problems but are all too often also outside the appropriate bounds of certiorari jurisdiction.\n\nIn some of the cases resulting in an affirmance of a judgment for an employee, sufficiency of the evidence was only one of the questions considered. It is impossible to ascertain why certiorari was granted, but these cases are included in the table because the Court did not restrict its grant of certiorari to the other issues, as it frequently does, and did consider the sufficiency-of-the-evidence question.\n\n\n[\nFootnote **\n] These figures include 1 summary per curiam disposition on the merits in the 1923 Term, 1 in the 1928 Term, 1 in the 1939 Term, 1 in the 1940 Term, 1 in the 1941 Term, 2 in the 1945 Term, 1 in the 1946 Term, 4 in the 1947 Term, 2 in the 1948 Term, 2 in the 1954 Term, and 3 in the 1955 Term.

ALABAMA(1957)\nNo. 53\nArgued: December 6, 1956Decided: January 14, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In an Alabama state court, petitioner, an uneducated Negro of low mentality or mentally ill, was convicted of burglary with intent to commit rape and was sentenced to death. Two confessions admitted in evidence at his trial were obtained while he was held in a state prison far from his home, without the preliminary hearing required by Alabama law and without advice of counsel, friends or family. The first confession was obtained after five days of intermittent questioning by police officers for several hours at a time and the second five days later after more such questioning. Held: The circumstances of pressure applied against the power of resistance of this petitioner, who was weak of will or mind, deprived him of due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 191-198.\n\n 263 Ala. 89, 81 So.2d 303, reversed and remanded.\n\nJack Greenberg argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Peter A. Hall and Orzell Billingsley.\n\nRobert Straub, Special Assistant Attorney General of Alabama, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was John Patterson, Attorney General.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner is under sentence of death for the crime of burglary with intent to commit rape. He seeks reversal of the judgment through a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama, which sustained the conviction. 263 Ala. 89, 81 So.2d 303. Petitioner raised three issues in support of his position that he had been denied due process of law. He alleged: \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 192]\n\u00a0\n\n\n1. Admission into evidence of two confessions extracted from him under circumstances demonstrating that the statements were coerced or involuntary.\n\n2. Denial by the trial judge of petitioner's request to testify about the manner in which the confessions were obtained without subjecting himself to unlimited cross-examination as to the facts of the crime charged.\n\n3. Selection of the grand jury which indicted him by a method that systematically discriminated against members of his race.\n\nWe granted certiorari to determine whether the requirements of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment had been satisfied in these aspects of petitioner's conviction. \n350 \nU.S. 993\n. The judgment must be reversed because of the admission of the confessions. Therefore, it is unnecessary at this time to decide or discuss the other two issues raised by petitioner.\n\nThe facts essential to the present decision are as follows:\n\nDuring the early months of 1953, a number of housebreakings, some involving rape or attempted rape, were committed in the City of Selma, Alabama. The present trial concerned one of these crimes.\n1\n On the night of April 24, 1953, an intruder broke into the apartment of the daughter of the city's mayor. She awoke to find a Negro man sitting on her with a knife at her throat. A struggle ensued which carried the woman and her assailant through the bedroom, hall, and living room, where she finally was able to seize the knife, at which point he fled. These rooms were all lighted. The victim testified \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 193]\n\u00a0\n that the attacker \"had a towel draped over his head\" throughout the incident; she did not identify petitioner as the attacker in her testimony at the trial. However, two other women testified to similar housebreakings (one of which resulted in rape), and they each identified petitioner as the burglar. This testimony was admitted at the present trial \"solely on the question of intent and identity of defendant and his motive on the occasion then on trial.\" 263 Ala., at 99, 81 So.2d, at 313. This, with the challenged confessions, was substantially all the evidence concerning the crime at the trial.\n\nAbout midnight on May 16, 1953, petitioner was apprehended in an alley in a white neighborhood in Selma by private persons, who called the police. The officers jailed him \"on an open charge of investigation.\" The next day, a Sunday, the questioning that led to the challenged confessions began. It is, of course, highly material to the question before this Court to ascertain petitioner's character and background. He is a Negro, 27 years old in 1953, who started school at age eight and left at 16 while still in the third grade. There was testimony by three psychiatrists at the trial, in connection with a pleaded defense of insanity, to the effect that petitioner is a schizophrenic and highly suggestible. His mother testified that he had always been \"thick-headed.\" Petitioner worked in a gas station in his home town of Marion, some 30 miles from Selma. So far as appears, his only prior involvement with the law was a conviction for burglary of a store in November 1949; he was released on parole in January 1951.\n\nThe questioning of petitioner was conducted principally by Captain Baker of the Selma police. His testimony that he repeatedly advised petitioner \"that he was entitled to counsel and his various rights\" must be viewed in the light of the facts concerning petitioner's mentality and experience just outlined. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 194]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe interrogation began on Sunday, May 17, with a two-hour session in the morning in Captain Baker's office. That afternoon, petitioner was questioned for two and a half or three hours, during part of which time he was driven around the city to some of the locations of the unsolved burglaries. During this ride, petitioner also talked to the sheriff of his home county, who had been called to Selma at petitioner's request, according to Captain Baker's testimony.\n\nOn Monday, petitioner talked with his employer. Captain Baker continued questioning for two hours in the morning. He testified that a warrant was served on petitioner in jail, but that petitioner did not request a preliminary hearing. In fact, he was not taken before any judicial officer prior to the confessions.\n2\n That afternoon, petitioner was driven to Kilby State Prison, which is located in another county, about 55 miles from Selma and some 80 miles from petitioner's home in Marion. The testimony of the responsible officers was that this \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 195]\n\u00a0\n removal was done for petitioner's protection, although no specific threat against him had been made.\n\nAt Kilby Prison, petitioner was kept in the \"segregation unit,\" out of contact with other prisoners. He saw only the jailers and Selma officers who drove over to question him. Petitioner was interrogated in an office in the prison. On Monday, there was questioning there for \"several hours\" in the afternoon and \"a little while\" after supper. The next interrogation was on Wednesday. It lasted \"several hours\" in the afternoon and into the evening. The following day petitioner was questioned for two hours in the afternoon and about an hour and a half in the evening. That day his father came to the prison to see him, but was refused admittance.\n\nOn Thursday evening, the first confession occurred. It was introduced at the trial through a tape recording. The confession consists of an interrogation by Captain Baker. Petitioner responded chiefly in yes-or-no answers to his questions, some of which were quite leading or suggestive.\n\nPetitioner was questioned again for three hours on Saturday, May 23. That day, a lawyer who came to the prison to see him was turned away. On Sunday, petitioner's father was allowed to visit his son. This was the only contact petitioner had during the entire period in question with family or friend, or for that matter with anyone he knew, except the talks at the beginning of the week with the sheriff of his own county, in the presence of Selma officers, and with his employer.\n\nIn the second week of his incarceration, on Tuesday afternoon, petitioner was questioned for about two and a half hours. At this time, the second confession was made. Like the other, it consists of responses to questions. The second confession was taken down by a prison stenographer and signed by petitioner after it was read to him. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 196]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis outline of the facts surrounding the taking of the confessions comes entirely from the testimony of the State witnesses, who under the circumstances were the only ones who could testify at the trial on this subject other than the prisoner himself. He did not testify, because of the trial judge's ruling that he would be subject to unlimited cross-examination concerning the offense charged against him.\n3\n Standing alone, the State's evidence establishes that the confessions in the present case were not voluntary within the meaning of the decisions of this Court.\n\nHere the prisoner was an uneducated Negro, certainly of low mentality, if not mentally ill. He was first arrested by civilians, lodged in jail, and then removed to \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 197]\n\u00a0\n a state prison far from his home. We do not criticize the decision to remove the prisoner before any possibility of violence might mature, but petitioner's location and the conditions of his incarceration are facts to be weighed in connection with the issue before us. For a period of a week, he was kept in isolation, except for sessions of questioning. He saw no friend or relative. Both his father and a lawyer were barred in attempts to see him. The protections to be afforded to a prisoner upon preliminary hearing were denied him, contrary to the law of Alabama.\n4\n He was questioned for several hours at a time over the course of five days preceding the first confession, and again interrogated at length before the written confession was secured.\n\nThere is no evidence of physical brutality, and particular elements that were present in other cases in which this Court ruled that a confession was coerced do not appear here. On the other hand, some of the elements in this case were not present in all of the prior cases. The objective facts in the present case are very much like those that were before the Court in Turner v. Pennsylvania, \n338 \nU.S. 62\n, while the present petitioner was a weaker and more susceptible subject than the record in that case reveals Turner to have been. And cf. Johnson v. Pennsylvania, \n340 \nU.S. 881\n. The totality of the circumstances that preceded the confessions in this case goes beyond the allowable limits. The use of the confessions secured in this setting was a denial of due process.\n\nNeither Stein v. New York, \n346 \nU.S. 156\n, nor any of the other cases relied on by respondent stands in the way of this conclusion. In Stein, the Court said:\n\n\"The limits in any case depend upon a weighing of the circumstances of pressure against the power of resistance of the person confessing. What would \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 198]\n\u00a0\n be overpowering to the weak of will or mind might be utterly ineffective against an experienced criminal.\" \n346 \nU.S., at 185\n.\n\n\n That is the same standard that has been utilized in each case, according to its total facts. Cf., e. g., Watts v. Indiana, \n338 \nU.S. 49, 53\n; Lyons v. Oklahoma, \n322 \nU.S. 596, 602\n-605. We hold that the circumstances of pressure applied against the power of resistance of this petitioner, who cannot be deemed other than weak of will or mind, deprived him of due process of law. So viewed, the judgment of conviction in this case cannot stand.\n\nThe judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner apparently was indicted for six of the burglary incidents. See 263 Ala., at 96, 81 So.2d, at 310. At the oral argument, counsel stated that shortly before the present trial petitioner had been convicted of another of these burglaries, one which had resulted in a rape, and sentenced to imprisonment for 99 years. It appears that no appeal was taken.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Alabama law specifically required bringing petitioner promptly before a magistrate:\n\n\"It is the duty of any private person, having arrested another for the commission of any public offense, to take him without unnecessary delay before a magistrate, or to deliver him to some one of the officers specified in section 152 of this title [police officers], who must forthwith take him before a magistrate.\" Code of Ala., 1940, Tit. 15, 160.\n\n\n Under the cases of that State, violation of this requirement does not render inadmissible a confession secured during such detention. See Ingram v. State, 252 Ala. 497, 42 So.2d 36. Nevertheless, such an occurrence is \"relevant circumstantial evidence in the inquiry as to physical or psychological coercion\" Stein v. New York, \n346 \nU.S. 156, 187\n.\n\nPetitioner was admitted to Kilby Prison on an order or letter from a State Circuit Judge. The nature of this procedure does not clearly appear from the record, but it is conceded that petitioner was not taken before the judge.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The issue was raised at the trial in this colloquy:\n\n\"Solicitor Hare: The State offers in evidence the recording heretofore testified to by the witness presently on the stand [Captain Baker].\n\n\n\"Attorney Hall: If the Court please, the defendant objects to what purports to be a recording made by this witness, on the ground that sufficient predicate has not been laid.\n\n\n\"The Court: Over-rule the objection.\n\n\n\"Attorney Hall: We except, sir, and we would like to make another motion. We would like to make an offer to put this defendant on the stand for the purpose of refuting certain allegations by the State with reference to the voluntary nature of what purports to be certain extra judicial admissions, and for no other purpose.\n\n\n\"Solicitor Hare: Now, may it please the Court, if the defendant takes the stand, I insist that he be subject to cross-examination on any and every item that is in evidence. I am not willing to make any agreement of limitation.\n\n\n\"The Court: And you are only offering the testimony of the defendant for the purpose of refuting the voluntary nature of this recording?\n\n\n\"Attorney Hall: Just that, sir.\n\n\n\"The Court: I sustain the State. If the State is not willing to reach a stipulation or agreement on that, but insists that you open defendant for cross-examination of any and every nature, I over-rule the motion.\" [R. 230-231.]\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See note 2, supra.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, concurring.\n\nIn joining the Court's opinion I should like to add a few words. A case like this is not easy for one who believes very strongly that adequate power should accompany the responsibility of the States for the enforcement of their criminal law. But the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has placed limitations upon the discretion, unbridled for all practical purposes, that belonged to the States prior to its adoption, and, more particularly, confines their freedom of action in devising criminal procedure. It is, I assume, common ground that if this record had disclosed an admission by the police of one truncheon blow on the head of petitioner a confession following such a blow would be inadmissible because of the Due Process Clause. For myself, I cannot see the difference, with respect to the \"voluntariness\" of a confession, between the subversion of freedom of the will through physical punishment and the sapping of the will appropriately to be inferred from the circumstances \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 199]\n\u00a0\n of this case - detention of the accused virtually incommunicado for a long period; failure to arraign him in that period;\n1\n horse-shedding of the accused at the intermittent pleasure of the police until confession was forthcoming. No single one of these circumstances alone would in my opinion justify a reversal. I cannot escape the conclusion, however, that in combination they bring the result below the Plimsoll line of \"due process.\"\n\nA state court's judgment of conviction must not be set aside by this Court where the practices of the prosecution, including the police as one of its agencies, do not offend what may fairly be deemed the civilized standards of the Anglo-American world.\n2\n This record reveals a course of conduct that, however conscientiously pursued, clearly falls below those standards. Such conduct is not only not consonant with our professions about criminal justice, as against authoritarian methods that we denounce. It derives from an attitude that is inimical, if experience is any guide, to the most enduring interests of law.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Flouting of the requirement of prompt arraignment prevailing in most States is in and of itself not a denial of due process. Cf. McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n. But it is to disregard experience not to recognize that the ordinary motive for such extended failure to arraign is not unrelated to the purpose of extracting confessions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Ours is the accusatorial as opposed to the inquisitorial system.\" Watts v. Indiana, \n338 \nU.S. 49, 54\n. An analysis of the particular phase of the judicial process involved in applying the Due Process Clause to state convictions secured on the basis of confessions has been attempted in my opinions in Malinski v. New York, \n324 \nU.S. 401, 412\n; Haley v. Ohio, \n332 \nU.S. 596, 601\n; Watts v. Indiana, supra.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.\n\nThe setting aside of this conviction, in my opinion, oversteps the boundary between this Court's function under the Fourteenth Amendment and that of the state \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 200]\n\u00a0\n courts in the administration of state criminal justice. I recognize that particularly in \"coerced confession\" cases the boundary line is frequently difficult to draw. But this Court has recognized that its corrective power over state courts in criminal cases is narrower than that which it exercises over the lower federal courts. Watts v. Indiana, \n338 \nU.S. 49, 50\n.\n\nIn this instance I do not think it can be said that the procedures followed in obtaining petitioner's confessions violated constitutional due process. The elements usually associated with cases in which this Court has been constrained to act are, in my opinion, not present here in constitutional proportions, separately or in combination. Concededly, there was no brutality or physical coercion. And psychological coercion is by no means manifest. While the total period of interrogation was substantial, the questioning was intermittent; it never exceeded two or three hours at a time, and all of it took place during normal hours; \"relay\" tactics, such as were condemned in Turner v. Pennsylvania, \n338 \nU.S. 62\n, and other cases,\n1\n were not employed. True, petitioner's mental equilibrium appears to have been less than normal, but these facts were before the trial judge and the jury. The absence of arraignment, much as that practice is to be deprecated, loses in significance in light of the State's representation at the oral argument that this was not an unusual thing in Alabama. As this Court recognizes, it did not of itself make the confessions inadmissible. Petitioner's removal to Kilby Prison, after authorization by a state circuit judge, stands on quite a different footing from the episode in Ward v. Texas, \n316 \nU.S. 547\n. And I am not satisfied that there was any deliberate purpose to keep the petitioner incommunicado, such as existed in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 201]\n\u00a0\n Watts v. Indiana, supra; Turner v. Pennsylvania, supra; and Harris v. South Carolina, supra. Before the first confession, petitioner, at his own request, was permitted to see the sheriff of his home county, and his employer. His father, although not permitted to see petitioner on the day of the first confession,\n2\n was allowed to see him before the second confession. The lawyer who sought to see petitioner was refused permission because, having no authority from petitioner or his family to represent him, the prison authorities evidently thought he was trying to solicit business.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Alabama, after reviewing the record, has sustained the conviction. 263 Ala. 89, 81 So.2d 303. I find nothing here beyond a state of facts upon which reasonable men might differ in their conclusions as to whether the confessions had been coerced. In the absence of anything in the conduct of the state authorities which \"shocks the conscience\" or does \"more than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism about combatting crime too energetically,\" Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165, 172\n, I think that due regard for the division between state and federal functions in the administration of criminal justice requires that we let Alabama's judgment stand.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, for example, Watts v. Indiana, supra; Haley v. Ohio, \n332 \nU.S. 596\n; Harris v. South Carolina, \n338 \nU.S. 68\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The record is silent as to why the father did not gain admittance on this first visit. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 191, 202]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFORD v.

With him on the brief was William W. Rymer, Jr.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented is whether 28 U.S.C. 1400 (b) is the sole and exclusive provision governing venue in patent infringement actions, or whether that section is supplemented by 28 U.S.C. 1391 (c). \n\n[353 \nU.S. 222, 223]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 1400 is titled \"Patents and copyrights,\" and subsection (b) reads:\n\n  \"(b) Any civil action for patent infringement may  be brought in the judicial district where the defendant  resides, or where the defendant has committed  acts of infringement and has a regular and established  place of business.\"\n\n\n Section 1391 is titled \"Venue generally,\" and subsection (c) reads:\n\n  \"(c) A corporation may be sued in any judicial  district in which it is incorporated or licensed to do  business or is doing business, and such judicial district  shall be regarded as the residence of such  corporation for venue purposes.\"\n\n\n Petitioner, Fourco Glass Company, a West Virginia corporation, was sued for patent infringement in the Southern District of New York. It moved to dismiss for lack of venue,\n1\n because, although it had a regularly established place of business in the district of suit, there was no showing that it had committed any of the alleged acts of infringement there. The District Court held that there had been no showing of any acts of infringement in the district of suit and that venue in patent infringement actions is solely and exclusively governed by 1400 (b), as a special and specific venue statute applicable to that species of litigation. It accordingly granted the motion and dismissed the action. 133 F. Supp. 531. The Court of Appeals, without passing on the District Court's ruling that there had been no showing of acts of infringement in the district of suit, reversed, 233 F.2d 885, 886, holding that proper construction \"requires . . . the insertion in\" 1400 (b) \"of the definition of corporate \n\n[353 \nU.S. 222, 224]\n\u00a0\n residence from\" 1391 (c), and that the two sections, when thus \"read together,\" mean \"that this defendant may be sued in New York, where it `is doing business.'\" We granted certiorari\n2\n because of an asserted conflict with this Court's decision in Stonite Products Co. v. Melvin Lloyd Co., \n315 \nU.S. 561\n, and to resolve a conflict among the circuits\n3\n upon the question of venue in patent infringement litigation.\n\nWe start our considerations with the Stonite case. The question there - not legally distinguishable from the question here - was whether the venue statute applying specifically to patent infringement litigation (then 48 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 109), was the sole provision governing venue in those cases, or whether that section was to be supplemented by what was then 52 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 113), which authorized - just as its recodified counterpart, 28 U.S.C. 1392 (a), does now - an action, not of a local nature, against two or more defendants residing in different judicial districts within the same state, to be brought in either district. That supplementation, if permissible, would have fixed venue over Stonite Products Company (an inhabitant of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania) in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 222, 225]\n\u00a0\n where the suit was brought, because its codefendant was an inhabitant of that district.\n\nAfter reviewing the history of, and the reasons and purposes for, the adoption by Congress of the venue statute applying specifically to patent infringement suits - ground wholly unnecessary to replow here - this Court held \"that 48 is the exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement proceedings\" and \"that Congress did not intend the Act of 1897 [which had become 48 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 109] to dovetail with the general provisions relating to the venue of civil suits, but rather that it alone should control venue in patent infringement proceedings.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe soundness of the Stonite case is not here assailed, and, unless there has been a substantive change in what was 48 of the Judicial Code at the time the Stonite case was decided, on March 9, 1942, it is evident that that statute would still constitute \"the exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement proceedings.\"\n\nThe question here, then, is simply whether there has been a substantive change in that statute since the Stonite case. If there has been such change, it occurred in the 1948 revision and recodification of the Judicial Code.\n5\n At the time of the Stonite case the venue provisions of that statute ( 48 of the 1911 Judicial Code. 28 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 109) read:\n\n \"In suits brought for the infringement of letters patent the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, in law or in equity, in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in any district in which the defendant, whether a person, partnership, or corporation, shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established place of business.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 222, 226]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The reports of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate,\n6\n and of the House,\n7\n respecting the 1948 revision and recodification of the Judicial Code, make plain that every change made in the text is explained in detail in the Revisers' Notes. As shown by their notes on 1400 (b), the Revisers placed the venue provisions (quoted above) of old 48 (28 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 109), with word changes and omissions later noted, in 1400 (b), and placed the remainder, or process provisions, with certain word changes, in 1694 of the 1948 Code. The Revisers' Notes on 1400 (b) point out that \"Subsection (b) is based on section 109 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with the following changes:\" (1) \"Words `civil action' were substituted for `suit,' and words `in law or in equity,' after `shall have jurisdiction' were deleted, in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\"; (2) \"Words in subsection (b) `where the defendant resides' were substituted for `of which the defendant is an inhabitant'\" because the \"Words `inhabitant' and `resident,' as respects venue, are synonymous\" [we pause here to observe that this treatment, and the expressed reason for it, seems to negative any intention to make corporations suable, in patent infringement cases, where they are merely \"doing business,\" because those synonymous words mean domicile, and, in respect of corporations, mean the state of incorporation only. See Shaw v. Quincy Mining Co., \n145 \nU.S. 444\n]; and (3) \"Words `whether a person, partnership, or corporation' before `has committed' were omitted as surplusage.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 222, 227]\n\u00a0\n\n\nStatements made by several of the persons having importantly to do with the 1948 revision are uniformly clear that no changes of law or policy are to be presumed from changes of language in the revision unless an intent to make such changes is clearly expressed.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\"The change of arrangement, which placed portions of what was originally a single section in two separated sections cannot be regarded as altering the scope and purpose of the enactment. For it will not be inferred that Congress, in revising and consolidating the laws, intended to change their effect unless such intention is clearly expressed. United States v. Ryder, \n110 \nU.S. 729, 740\n; United States v. LeBris, \n121 \nU.S. 278, 280\n; Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263, 302\n; United States v. Mason, \n218 \nU.S. 517, 525\n.\" Anderson v. Pacific Coast S. S. Co., \n225 \nU.S. 187, 198\n-199.\n\n\n In the light of the fact that the Revisers' Notes do not express any substantive change, and of the fact that several of those having importantly to do with the revision \n\n[353 \nU.S. 222, 228]\n\u00a0\n say no change is to be presumed unless clearly expressed, and no substantive change being otherwise apparent, we hold that 28 U.S.C. 1400 (b) made no substantive change from 28 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 109 as it stood and was dealt with in the Stonite case.\n\nThe main thrust of respondents' argument is that 1391 (c) is clear and unambiguous and that its terms include all actions - including patent infringement actions - against corporations, and, therefore, that the statute should be read with, and as supplementing, 1400 (b) in patent infringement actions. That argument is not persuasive, as it merely points up the question and does nothing to answer it. For it will be seen that 1400 (b) is equally clear and, also, that it deals specially and specifically with venue in patent infringement actions. Moreover, it will be remembered that old 52 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 113) was likewise clear and generally embracive, yet the Stonite case held that it did not supplement the specific patent infringement venue section (then 48 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 109). The question is not whether 1391 (c) is clear and general, but, rather, it is, pointedly, whether 1391 (c) supplements 1400 (b), or, in other words, whether the latter is complete, independent and alone controlling in its sphere as was held in Stonite, or is, in some measure, dependent for its force upon the former.\n\nWe think it is clear that 1391 (c) is a general corporation venue statute, whereas 1400 (b) is a special venue statute applicable, specifically, to all defendants in a particular type of actions, i. e., patent infringement actions. In these circumstances the law is settled that \"However inclusive may be the general language of a statute, it `will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment. . . . Specific terms prevail over the general in the same or another statute \n\n[353 \nU.S. 222, 229]\n\u00a0\n which otherwise might be controlling.' Ginsberg & Sons v. Popkin, \n285 \nU.S. 204, 208\n.\" MacEvoy Co. v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 102, 107\n.\n\nWe hold that 28 U.S.C. 1400 (b) is the sole and exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement actions, and that it is not to be supplemented by the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1391 (c). The judgment of the Court of Appeals must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded for that court to pass upon the District Court's ruling that there had been no showing of acts of infringement in the district of suit.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, believing that the Revisers' Notes have been given undue weight, Ex parte Collett, \n337 \nU.S. 55, 61\n-71, and that they are in any event unclear, dissents for the reasons given by the Court of Appeals, 233 F.2d 885.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and James W. Booth.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe factual background and the question presented in this case are the same as in Jackson v. Taylor, ante, p. 569, decided today. The case reaches us from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 234 F.2d 615, which had reversed the District Court. We granted certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 940\n. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 583, 584]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere are additional reasons to those in Jackson v. Taylor advanced for reversal in this case. Fowler contends that the 20-year sentence is arbitrarily severe, even though within the statutory maximum, citing United States v. Voorhees, 4 U.S.C. M. A. 509, 16 C. M. R. 83 (1954). But as we said in Burns v. Wilson, \n346 \nU.S. 137\n (1953), this Court exerts \"no supervisory power over the courts which enforce [military law]; the rights of men in the armed forces must perforce be conditioned to meet certain overriding demands of discipline and duty, and the civil courts are not the agencies which must determine the precise balance to be struck in this adjustment. The Framers expressly entrusted that task to Congress.\" Id., at 140. If there is injustice in the sentence imposed it is for the Executive to correct, for since the board of review has authority to act, we have no jurisdiction to interfere with the exercise of its discretion. That power is placed by the Congress in the hands of those entrusted with the administration of military justice, or if clemency is in order, the Executive. It may be that the board's judgment was harsh or that the military's highest court should have intervened as it did in the Voorhees case, but we have no jurisdiction in that regard. As long ago as 1902 this Court recognized that it was a \"salutary rule that the sentences of courts martial, when affirmed by the military tribunal of last resort, cannot be revised by the civil courts save only when void because of an absolute want of power, and not merely voidable because of the defective exercise of power possessed.\" Carter v. McClaughry, \n183 \nU.S. 365, 401\n.\n\nWe note that petitioner's reliance on Voorhees' case is misplaced when he cites it as apposite to the problem here presented. While the Court of Military Appeals held there that the board should have ordered a rehearing, the rehearing was to include a reconsideration of the finding \n\n[353 \nU.S. 583, 585]\n\u00a0\n of guilt as well as the sentence. Though, as Judge Latimer indicates in his opinion, the board of review had the power to approve the sentence, dismissal from the service, such approval was found by that court to be an abuse of the discretion placed in the board under the particular circumstances of the case. We, of course, do not sit to pass on the exercise of discretion by the military authorities. Judge Latimer further indicated the Court of Military Appeals' recognition of the power of the board of review to affirm such parts, or amount of a sentence, as it finds correct in fact and law. The case, then, instead of supporting petitioner's position, indicates authority for the power of the board to modify the sentence. See United States v. Bigger, 2 U.S.C. M. A. 297, 8 C. M. R. 97 (1953).\n\nThe argument that the adjustment of the sentence by the board deprives the petitioner of two appeals likewise is without merit. He contends that if the resentencing were done by a court-martial he would have a review of that resentencing by the convening authority as well as the board of review. But Congress did not intend any such result. The accused has already had his day before the court-martial and the convening authority. It is not for us to say that the procedure established by Congress is unwise. There are no constitutional questions before us. We have determined that the board of review had jurisdiction to modify the sentence. Our inquiry cannot be extended beyond that question.\n\nFor these reasons, and those stated in Jackson v. Taylor, ante, p. 569, the judgment is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR.

With him on the brief were Lane McGovern and James Vorenberg.\n\nAllan R. Rosenberg argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a companion case to No. 211, Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, ante, p. 448. Respondent-union and petitioner-employer entered into a collective bargaining agreement governing the hours of work, rates of pay, and working conditions in a Massachusetts plant owned by petitioner. The agreement provided a procedure for the settlement of employee grievances, a procedure having four steps. It also provided that, when the four steps had been exhausted, either party could, with exceptions not material here, submit the grievance to arbitration. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 547, 548]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe respondent filed written grievances, one asking higher pay for an employee and another complaining that an employee had been wrongfully discharged. Both complaints were carried through the four steps. The union, being dissatisfied, asked for arbitration. The employer refused. The union brought suit in the District Court to compel arbitration of the grievance disputes. The District Court dismissed the bill, being of the view that the relief sought was barred by the Norris-LaGuardia Act. 129 F. Supp. 665. The Court of Appeals reversed, 233 F.2d 85. It first held that the Norris-LaGuardia Act did not bar enforcement of the arbitration agreement. It then held that while 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 gave the District Court jurisdiction of the cause, it supplied no body of substantive law to enforce an arbitration agreement governing grievances. But it found such a basis in the United States Arbitration Act, which it held applicable to these collective bargaining agreements. It accordingly reversed the District Court judgment and remanded the cause to that court for further proceedings.\n\nWe affirm that judgment and remand the cause to the District Court. We follow in part a different path than the Court of Appeals, though we reach the same result. As indicated in our opinion in No. 211, Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, supra, we think that 301 (a) furnishes a body of federal substantive law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements in industries in commerce or affecting commerce and that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not bar the issuance of an injunction to enforce the obligation to arbitrate grievance disputes.\n\n      Affirmed. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON, whom MR.

The fact that the intrusion was unintentional does not remove the effect of the intrusion.\n\n\n Mr. Justice REED, with whom Mr. Justice BURTON and Mr. Justice CLARK join, dissenting.\n  The Remmer case, dealing with a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into a suspected approach to a juror by a defendant, is not in our judgment controlling in this FBI inquiry of people who happened to be Gold jurors concerning a different Communist case. Compare the facts and conclusions of law in Remmer v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 377\n, 381, 382, 427, 428, and \n347 \nU.S. 227\n, with the facts stated in Gold v. United States, 237 F.2d 764, 775.\n  While a presumption of prejudice arises when a juror in a criminal case receives a private communication bearing even remotely on the trial, the question in each such case is whether that presumption has been rebutted. Cf. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 985\n, 986]\n\u00a0\n Remmer v. United States, \n347 \nU.S. 227, 229\n, 451, and Mattox v.

In our view this made it proper to go ahead, as the court did, with the trial.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARK, dissenting.\n  While I too feel that the narrow ground of Remmer's case should not be used to bring about reversal here, I am also disturbed by the refusal of the Court to decide other important questions urged upon us by both parties and ready for disposition. Among these are the applicability of the perjury rule of evidence to the false statement statute, eligibility of government employees to serve as jurors, admissibility of evidence of prior activity in the Communist Party to disprove the sincerity of a resignation therefrom, the use of expert witnesses to prove continuing membership and the correctness of the court's charges as to membership in the Party, etc. It seems to me that proper judicial administration requires this Court to decide these important issues, particularly since they will again arise at the retrial. Furthermore, similar cases involving the same legal points are pending in various districts throughout the country. The refusal of the majority today to pass upon them thus deprives the federal judiciary of this Court's opinion, which renders today's error multifold. It will cause undue hardship in the trial of all of these cases, not only on the Government but on the defendants as well.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case, a companion case to No. 211, Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, ante, p. 448, was brought by respondent-union in the District Court to compel specific performance \n\n[353 \nU.S. 550, 551]\n\u00a0\n of a grievance arbitration provision of a collective bargaining agreement between it and petitioner. The controversy arose over the layoff of employees incident to a curtailment of production and a liquidation of the plants in question. Petitioner terminated the employment of the men who were laid off. The respondent protested the termination of employment, claiming that the men should not have been discharged, thus preserving certain accrued rights to fringe benefits (such as insurance, pensions, and vacations) payable to laid-off employees.\n\nThe District Court granted specific performance. 131 F. Supp. 767. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 233 F.2d 104, relying on its prior decision in General Electric Co. v. United Electrical Workers, ante, p. 547. For the reasons given in No. 211, Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, ante, p. 448, we think the Court of Appeals was correct in affirming the District Court's judgment ordering enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate.\n\nThere remains the question whether an order directing arbitration is appealable. This case is not comparable to Baltimore Contractors v. Bodinger, \n348 \nU.S. 176\n, which held that a stay pending arbitration was not a \"final decision\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 1291. Nor need we consider cases like In re Pahlberg, 131 F.2d 968, and Schoenamsgruber v. Hamburg Line, \n294 \nU.S. 454\n, holding that an order directing arbitration under the United States Arbitration Act is not appealable. The right enforced here is one arising under 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. Arbitration is not merely a step in judicial enforcement of a claim nor auxiliary to a main proceeding, but the full relief sought. A decree under 301 (a) ordering enforcement of an \n\n[353 \nU.S. 550, 552]\n\u00a0\n arbitration provision in a collective bargaining agreement is, therefore, a \"final decision\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 1291.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON, whom MR.

Feller and Herbert S. Thatcher.\n\nGordon Madison, Assistant Attorney General of Alabama, argued the cause for appellees. With him on the brief was John Patterson, Attorney General.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nIn 1953, the Alabama Legislature enacted a statute (Ala. Laws 1953, No. 720) which provides that any public employee who joins or participates in a \"labor union or labor organization\" forfeits the \"rights, benefits, or privileges which he enjoys as a result of his public employment.\" Section 1 defines a \"labor union or labor organization\" to include an organization of employees whose purpose is to deal with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, or conditions of employment. Teachers, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 364, 365]\n\u00a0\n certain employees of the State Docks Board and city and county employees, however, are exempted from the provisions of the Act.\n\nAppellants are an organization composed of employees of governmental and civic agencies, and a member of the organization who is employed by a retail liquor store operated by the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. They commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama to enjoin the enforcement of the state statute on the grounds that it abridged the freedoms of expression and association of public employees, and that the statute violated the Due Process, Privileges and Immunities, and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe three-judge District Court, convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281, 2284, withheld the exercise of its jurisdiction, retaining the cause \"for a reasonable time to permit the exhaustion of such State administrative and judicial remedies as may be available.\" 116 F. Supp. 354, 359. We affirmed that judgment of the District Court. \n347 \nU.S. 901\n.\n\nAppellant union commenced an action in the Alabama courts to obtain an \"authoritative construction\" of the state statute. A bill in equity was filed in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama, praying that the enforcement of the statute against the union or its members be enjoined, and for a declaratory judgment that the union was not a \"labor union or labor organization\" within the meaning of the statute. In its complaint, the union denied that the statute applied to it or its members. None of the constitutional contentions presented in the action pending in the United States District Court were advanced in the state court action. After hearing testimony, the Circuit Court of Montgomery County denied the union's prayer for relief, holding that the statute applied to the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n union, its members and its activities. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed. 262 Ala. 285, 78 So.2d 646. It held that a local union operating under the appellant's rules and constitution would be subject to the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe case was resubmitted to the three-judge District Court for final decree. The District Court dismissed the action with prejudice, saying that the Alabama courts have not construed the Act \"in such a manner as to render it unconstitutional, and, of course, we cannot assume that the State courts will ever so construe said statute.\" 146 F. Supp. 214, 216. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n352 \nU.S. 905\n.\n\nWe do not reach the constitutional issues. In an action brought to restrain the enforcement of a state statute on constitutional grounds, the federal court should retain jurisdiction until a definitive determination of local law questions is obtained from the local courts. One policy served by that practice is that of not passing on constitutional questions in situations where an authoritative interpretation of state law may avoid the constitutional issues. Spector Motor Co. v. McLaughlin, \n323 \nU.S. 101, 105\n. Another policy served by that practice is the avoidance of the adjudication of abstract, hypothetical issues. Federal courts will not pass upon constitutional contentions presented in an abstract rather than in a concrete form. Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, \n331 \nU.S. 549, 575\n, 584. The bare adjudication by the Alabama Supreme Court that the union is subject to this Act does not suffice, since that court was not asked to interpret the statute in light of the constitutional objections presented to the District Court. If appellants' freedom-of-expression and equal-protection arguments had been presented to the state court, it might have construed the statute in a different manner. Accordingly, the judgment of the District \n\n[353 \nU.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n Court is vacated, and this cause is remanded to it with directions to retain jurisdiction until efforts to obtain an appropriate adjudication in the state courts have been exhausted.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREEN v.

The judge instructed the jury that it could find him guilty of either first degree murder or second degree murder. The jury found him guilty of second degree murder, and its verdict was silent on the charge of first degree murder. The trial judge accepted the verdict, entered judgment, dismissed the jury and sentenced petitioner to imprisonment. On appeal, his conviction was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial. On remand, petitioner was tried again for first degree murder under the original indictment, convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death, notwithstanding his plea of former jeopardy. Held: Petitioner's second trial for first degree murder placed him in jeopardy twice for the same offense in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and the conviction is reversed. Pp. 185-198.\n\n (a) Petitioner's jeopardy for first degree murder came to an end when the jury was discharged at the conclusion of his first trial, and he could not be retried for that offense.

Imlay was also on the brief on the original argument.\n\nOpinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE BLACK, announced by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n\nThis case presents a serious question concerning the meaning and application of that provision of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution which declares that no person shall\n\n \". . . be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\"\n\n\n The petitioner, Everett Green, was indicted by a District of Columbia grand jury in two counts. The first charged that he had committed arson by maliciously setting fire to a house.\n1\n The second accused him of causing the death of a woman by this alleged arson which if true amounted to murder in the first degree punishable by death.\n2\n Green entered a plea of not guilty to both counts and the case was tried by a jury. After each side had presented its evidence the trial judge instructed the jury that it could find Green guilty of arson under the first count and of either (1) first degree murder or (2) second degree murder under the second count. The trial judge treated second degree murder, which is defined by the District Code as the killing of another with malice \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 186]\n\u00a0\n aforethought and is punishable by imprisonment for a term of years or for life,\n3\n as an offense included within the language charging first degree murder in the second count of the indictment.\n\nThe jury found Green guilty of arson and of second degree murder but did not find him guilty on the charge of murder in the first degree. Its verdict was silent on that charge. The trial judge accepted the verdict, entered the proper judgments and dismissed the jury. Green was sentenced to one to three years' imprisonment for arson and five to twenty years' imprisonment for murder in the second degree. He appealed the conviction of second degree murder. The Court of Appeals reversed that conviction because it was not supported by evidence and remanded the case for a new trial. 95 U.S. App. D.C. 45, 218 F.2d 856.\n\nOn remand Green was tried again for first degree murder under the original indictment. At the outset of this second trial he raised the defense of former jeopardy but the court overruled his plea. This time a new jury found him guilty of first degree murder and he was given the mandatory death sentence. Again he appealed. Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals rejected his defense of former jeopardy, relying on Trono v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 521\n, and affirmed the conviction. 98 U.S. App. D.C. 413, 236 F.2d 708. One judge concurred in the result, and three judges dissented expressing the view that Green had twice been placed in jeopardy in violation of the Constitution. We granted certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 915\n. Although Green raises a number of other contentions here \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 187]\n\u00a0\n we find it necessary to consider only his claim of former jeopardy.\n\nThe constitutional prohibition against \"double jeopardy\" was designed to protect an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense. In his Commentaries, which greatly influenced the generation that adopted the Constitution, Blackstone recorded:\n\n \". . . the plea of auterfoits acquit, or a former acquittal, is grounded on this universal maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life more than once for the same offence.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n Substantially the same view was taken by this Court in Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, at 169:\n\n \"The common law not only prohibited a second punishment for the same offence, but it went further and forbid a second trial for the same offence, whether the accused had suffered punishment or not, and whether in the former trial he had been acquitted or convicted.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 188]\n\u00a0\n as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\n\nIn accordance with this philosophy it has long been settled under the Fifth Amendment that a verdict of acquittal is final, ending a defendant's jeopardy, and even when \"not followed by any judgment, is a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the same offence.\" United States v. Ball, \n163 \nU.S. 662, 671\n. Thus it is one of the elemental principles of our criminal law that the Government cannot secure a new trial by means of an appeal even though an acquittal may appear to be erroneous. United States v. Ball, supra; Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331, 344\n-345. Cf. Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100\n; United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310\n.\n\nMoreover it is not even essential that a verdict of guilt or innocence be returned for a defendant to have once been placed in jeopardy so as to bar a second trial on the same charge. This Court, as well as most others, has taken the position that a defendant is placed in jeopardy once he is put to trial before a jury so that if the jury is discharged without his consent he cannot be tried again. Wade v. Hunter, \n336 \nU.S. 684\n; Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 128\n. In general see American Law Institute, Administration of The Criminal Law: Double Jeopardy 61-72 (1935). This prevents a prosecutor or judge from subjecting a defendant to a second prosecution by discontinuing the trial when it appears that the jury might not convict. At the same time jeopardy is not regarded as having come to an end so as to bar a second trial in those cases where \"unforeseeable circumstances . . . arise during [the first] trial making its completion impossible, such as the failure of a jury to agree on a verdict.\" Wade v. Hunter, \n336 \nU.S. 684, 688\n-689. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 189]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt common law a convicted person could not obtain a new trial by appeal except in certain narrow instances.\n6\n As this harsh rule was discarded courts and legislatures provided that if a defendant obtained the reversal of a conviction by his own appeal he could be tried again for the same offense.\n7\n Most courts regarded the new trial as a second jeopardy but justified this on the ground that the appellant had \"waived\" his plea of former jeopardy by asking that the conviction be set aside.\n8\n Other courts viewed the second trial as continuing the same jeopardy which had attached at the first trial by reasoning that jeopardy did not come to an end until the accused was acquitted or his conviction became final.\n9\n But whatever the rationalization, this Court has also held that a defendant can be tried a second time for an offense when his prior conviction for that same offense had been set aside on appeal. United States v. Ball, \n163 \nU.S. 662\n.\n\nIn this case, however, we have a much different question. At Green's first trial the jury was authorized to find him guilty of either first degree murder (killing while \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 190]\n\u00a0\n perpetrating a felony) or, alternatively, of second degree murder (killing with malice aforethought).\n10\n The jury found him guilty of second degree murder, but on his appeal that conviction was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. At this new trial Green was tried again, not for second degree murder, but for first degree murder, even though the original jury had refused to find him guilty on that charge and it was in no way involved in his appeal.\n11\n For the reasons stated hereafter, we conclude that this second trial for first degree murder placed Green in jeopardy twice for the same offense in violation of the Constitution.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nGreen was in direct peril of being convicted and punished for first degree murder at his first trial. He was forced to run the gantlet once on that charge and the jury refused to convict him. When given the choice between finding him guilty of either first or second degree murder it chose the latter. In this situation the great majority of cases in this country have regarded the jury's verdict as an implicit acquittal on the charge of first degree murder.\n13\n But the result in this case need not rest alone \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 191]\n\u00a0\n on the assumption, which we believe legitimate, that the jury for one reason or another acquitted Green of murder in the first degree. For here, the jury was dismissed without returning any express verdict on that charge and without Green's consent. Yet it was given a full opportunity to return a verdict and no extraordinary circumstances appeared which prevented it from doing so. Therefore it seems clear, under established principles of former jeopardy, that Green's jeopardy for first degree murder came to an end when the jury was discharged so that he could not be retried for that offense. Wade v. Hunter, \n336 \nU.S. 684\n. In brief, we believe this case can be treated no differently, for purposes of former jeopardy, than if the jury had returned a verdict which expressly read: \"We find the defendant not guilty of murder in the first degree but guilty of murder in the second degree.\"\n\nAfter the original trial, but prior to his appeal, it is indisputable that Green could not have been tried again for first degree murder for the death resulting from the fire. A plea of former jeopardy would have absolutely barred a new prosecution even though it might have been convincingly demonstrated that the jury erred in failing to convict him of that offense. And even after appealing the conviction of second degree murder he still could not have been tried a second time for first degree murder had his appeal been unsuccessful.\n\nNevertheless the Government contends that Green \"waived\" his constitutional defense of former jeopardy to a second prosecution on the first degree murder charge by making a successful appeal of his improper conviction of second degree murder. We cannot accept this paradoxical contention. \"Waiver\" is a vague term used for a great variety of purposes, good and bad, in the law. In any normal sense, however, it connotes some kind of voluntary knowing relinquishment of a right. Cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458\n. When a man has been convicted \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 192]\n\u00a0\n of second degree murder and given a long term of imprisonment it is wholly fictional to say that he \"chooses\" to forego his constitutional defense of former jeopardy on a charge of murder in the first degree in order to secure a reversal of an erroneous conviction of the lesser offense. In short, he has no meaningful choice. And as Mr. Justice Holmes observed, with regard to this same matter in Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100\n, at 135: \"Usually no such waiver is expressed or thought of. Moreover, it cannot be imagined that the law would deny to a prisoner the correction of a fatal error, unless he should waive other rights so important as to be saved by an express clause in the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nIt is true that in Kepner, a case arising in the Philippine Islands under a statutory prohibition against double jeopardy, Mr. Justice Holmes dissented from the Court's holding that the Government could not appeal an acquittal in a criminal prosecution. He argued that there was only one continuing jeopardy until the \"case\" had finally been settled, appeal and all, without regard to how many times the defendant was tried, but that view was rejected by the Court. The position taken by the majority in Kepner is completely in accord with the deeply entrenched principle of our criminal law that once a person has been acquitted of an offense he cannot be prosecuted again on the same charge. This Court has uniformly adhered to that basic premise. For example, in United States v. Ball, \n163 \nU.S. 662, 671\n, a unanimous Court held:\n\n\"The verdict of acquittal was final, and could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting [the defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.\"\n\n\n And see Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331, 344\n-345; United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310\n. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 193]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUsing reasoning which purports to be analogous to that expressed by Mr. Justice Holmes in Kepner, the Government alternatively argues that Green, by appealing, prolonged his original jeopardy so that when his conviction for second degree murder was reversed and the case remanded he could be tried again for first degree murder without placing him in new jeopardy. We believe this argument is also untenable. Whatever may be said for the notion of continuing jeopardy with regard to an offense when a defendant has been convicted of that offense and has secured reversal of the conviction by appeal, here Green was not convicted of first degree murder and that offense was not involved in his appeal. If Green had only appealed his conviction of arson and that conviction had been set aside surely no one would claim that he could have been tried a second time for first degree murder by reasoning that his initial jeopardy on that charge continued until every offense alleged in the indictment had been finally adjudicated.\n\nReduced to plain terms, the Government contends that in order to secure the reversal of an erroneous conviction of one offense, a defendant must surrender his valid defense of former jeopardy not only on that offense but also on a different offense for which he was not convicted and which was not involved in his appeal. Or stated in the terms of this case, he must be willing to barter his constitutional protection against a second prosecution for an offense punishable by death as the price of a successful appeal from an erroneous conviction of another offense for which he has been sentenced to five to twenty years' imprisonment. As the Court of Appeals said in its first opinion in this case, a defendant faced with such a \"choice\" takes a \"desperate chance\" in securing the reversal of the erroneous conviction. The law should not, and in our judgment does not, place the defendant in such an incredible dilemma. Conditioning an appeal of one \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 194]\n\u00a0\n offense on a coerced surrender of a valid plea of former jeopardy on another offense exacts a forfeiture in plain conflict with the constitutional bar against double jeopardy.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government argues, however, that we should accept Trono v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 521\n, as a conclusive precedent against Green's claim of former jeopardy.\n15\n The Trono case arose in the Philippine Islands, \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 195]\n\u00a0\n shortly after they had been annexed by the United States, under a statutory prohibition against double jeopardy. At that time a sharply divided Court took the view that not all constitutional guarantees were \"applicable\" in the insular possessions, particularly where the imposition of these guarantees would disrupt established customs. Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244\n. In Trono the defendants had been charged with murder but were acquitted by the trial court which instead found them guilty of the lesser offense of assault. They appealed the assault conviction to the Philippine Supreme Court. That court, acting under peculiar local procedures modeled on pre-existing Spanish practices, which allowed it to review the facts and law and to substitute its findings for those of the trial judge, set aside their acquittal, found them guilty of murder and increased their sentences.\n\nOn review by this Court, Mr. Justice Peckham, writing for himself and three other Justices, took the position that by appealing the conviction for assault the defendants waived their plea of former jeopardy with regard to the charge of murder. He said:\n\n\"We do not agree to the view that the accused has the right to limit his waiver as to jeopardy, when he appeals from a judgment against him. As the judgment stands before he appeals, it is a complete bar to any further prosecution for the offense set forth in the indictment . . . . No power can wrest from him the right to so use that judgment, but if he chooses to appeal from it . . . he thereby waives, if successful, his right to avail himself of the former acquittal of the greater offense . . . .\" \n199 \nU.S., at 533\n. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 196]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes refused to join the Peckham opinion but concurred in the result. Just the year before, in Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 135\n, he had sharply denounced the notion of \"waiver\" as indefensible. There is nothing which indicates that his views had changed in the meantime. As pointed out above, he did dissent from the holding in Kepner - that the Government could not appeal an acquittal - on the ground that a new trial after an appeal by the Government was part of a continuing jeopardy rather than a second jeopardy. But that contention has been consistently rejected by this Court.\n\nChief Justice Fuller and Justices Harlan, White, and McKenna dissented in Trono. Mr. Justice McKenna wrote a dissent which was concurred in by Justices White and Harlan. During the course of this opinion he stated:\n\n\"It is, in effect, held that because the defendants . . . appealed and sought a review, as authorized by the statute, of the minor offense for which they were convicted, the United States was given the right to try them for the greater offense for which they were acquitted. . . . I think that the guarantees of constitutions and laws should not be so construed. . . . I submit that the State seeks no convictions except in legal ways, and because it does not it affords means of review of erroneous rulings and judgments, and freely affords such means. It does not clog them with conditions or forfeit by their exercise great and constitutional rights.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\"Here and there may be found a decision which supports the exposition of once in jeopardy expressed in the [Peckham] opinion. Opposed to it is the general consensus of opinion of American text books on criminal law and the overwhelming weight of American decided cases.\" \n199 \nU.S., at 538\n-539, 540. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 197]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n We do not believe that Trono should be extended beyond its peculiar factual setting to control the present case. All that was before the Court in Trono was a statutory provision against double jeopardy pertaining to the Philippine Islands - a territory just recently conquered with long-established legal procedures that were alien to the common law.\n16\n Even then it seems apparent that a majority of the Court was unable to agree on any common ground for the conclusion that an appeal of a lesser offense destroyed a defense of former jeopardy on a greater offense for which the defendant had already been acquitted. As a matter of fact, it appears that each of the rationalizations advanced to justify this result was rejected by a majority of the Court. As Mr. Justice Holmes, who concurred in the result, effectively demonstrated, the \"waiver theory\" is totally unsound and indefensible. On the other hand Mr. Justice Holmes' theory of continuing jeopardy has never outwardly been adhered to by any other Justice of this Court.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 198]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe that if either of the rationales offered to support the Trono result were adopted here it would unduly impair the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. The right not to be placed in jeopardy more than once for the same offense is a vital safeguard in our society, one that was dearly won and one that should continue to be highly valued. If such great constitutional protections are given a narrow, grudging application they are deprived of much of their significance. We do not feel that Trono or any other decision by this Court compels us to forego the conclusion that the second trial of Green for first degree murder was contrary to both the letter and spirit of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] D.C.

Gibert, 25 Fed. Cas. 1287.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Under English law the appellate court has no power to order a new trial after any appeal except in certain cases where the first trial was a complete \"nullity,\" as for example when the trial court was without jurisdiction over the person or subject matter. See 4 Stephen, Commentaries on the Laws of England (21st ed. 1950), 284. The English appellate court does have power to substitute a finding of guilt of a lesser offense if the evidence warrants, but it cannot find the defendant guilty of an offense for which he was acquitted or increase his sentence. See 10 Halsbury, Laws of England (Simonds ed. 1955), 539-541, and the cases cited there.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See, e. g., Brewster v. Swope, 180 F.2d 984; State v. McCord, 8 Kan. 232, 12 Am. Rep. 469; Cross v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 62, 77 S. E. 2d 447; Smith v. State, 196 Wis. 102, 219 N. W. 270.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See, e. g., State v. Aus, 105 Mont. 82, 69 P.2d 584. Cf. Griffin v. Illinois, \n351 \nU.S. 12, 18\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In substance the situation was the same as though Green had been charged with these different offenses in separate but alternative counts of the indictment. The constitutional issues at stake here should not turn on the fact that both offenses were charged to the jury under one count.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] It should be noted that Green's claim of former jeopardy is not based on his previous conviction for second degree murder but instead on the original jury's refusal to convict him of first degree murder.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Many of the state courts which have considered the problem have concluded that under circumstances similar to those of this case a defendant cannot be tried a second time for first degree murder. Other state cases take a contrary position. In general see the Annotations at 59 A. L. R. 1160, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 959, and 5 L. R. A. (N. S.) 571. Of course, many of the state decisions rest on local constitutional or statutory provisions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See cases collected in the Annotations cited in n. 12, supra, and the Annotation at 114 A. L. R. 1406.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The suggestion is made that under the District Code second degree murder is not an offense included in a charge of first degree murder for causing a death in the course of perpetrating a felony (commonly referred to as \"felony murder\") because it involves elements different from those necessary to establish the felony murder, and that therefore Green could not legally have been convicted of second degree murder under the indictment. We fail to comprehend how this suggestion aids the Government. In the first place, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has expressly held that second degree murder is a lesser offense which can be proved under a charge of felony murder. Goodall v. United States, 86 U.S. App. D.C. 148, 180 F.2d 397; Green v. United States, 95 U.S. App. D.C. 45, 218 F.2d 856. Even more important, Green's plea of former jeopardy does not rest on his conviction for second degree murder but instead on the first jury's refusal to find him guilty of felony murder.\n\nIt is immaterial whether second degree murder is a lesser offense included in a charge of felony murder or not. The vital thing is that it is a distinct and different offense. If anything, the fact that it cannot be classified as \"a lesser included offense\" under the charge of felony murder buttresses our conclusion that Green was unconstitutionally twice placed in jeopardy. American courts have held with uniformity that where a defendant is charged with two offenses, neither of which is a lesser offense included within the other, and has been found guilty on one but not on the second he cannot be tried again on the second even though he secures reversal of the conviction and even though the two offenses are related offenses charged in the same indictment. See, e. g., Annotation, 114 A. L. R. 1406.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] With the exception of Trono, the Government appears to concede in its brief, pp. 38-39, that the double jeopardy problem raised in this case has not been squarely before this Court. Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319\n, Brantley v. Georgia, \n217 \nU.S. 284\n, and Kring v. Missouri, \n107 \nU.S. 221\n, are not controlling here since they involved \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 195]\n\u00a0\n trials in state courts. Stroud v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 15\n, is clearly distinguishable. In that case a defendant was retried for first degree murder after he had successfully asked an appellate court to set aside a prior conviction for that same offense.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] In the course of his opinion Mr. Justice Peckham made some general observations to the effect that he regarded the statutory provision as having the same effect as the Fifth Amendment. Those remarks were not essential to the decision so that even if they had been accepted by the full Court they would not be conclusive in this case where the interpretation of the Fifth Amendment is necessarily decisive. Cf. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399; Humphrey's Executor v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 602, 626\n-627.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna who dissented with Mr. Justice Holmes in Kepner refused to agree with the Court in Trono. In his dissent in the latter case Mr. Justice McKenna attributed his vote in Kepner to the fact that the Philippine Islands had a system of jurisprudence which was totally different from ours in that it provided no trial by jury and traditionally had permitted appellate courts to review both the law and the facts in criminal cases and to substitute their findings for those made by the trial judge. Justice Peckham, in his opinion, also recognized the peculiar nature of these Philippine procedures.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON, MR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nOn the basis of the following facts the Court has concluded that petitioner has twice been put in jeopardy of life in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner was tried under an indictment on two counts. The first count charged arson under D.C. Code, 1951, 22-401. The second count charged murder in the first degree under D.C. Code, 1951, 22-2401, in that in perpetrating the arson petitioner had caused the death of one Bettie Brown. In submitting the case to the jury under the second count, the trial court instructed on both first and second degree murder. The jury returned a verdict finding petitioner guilty of arson under the first count and of second degree murder under the second count; the verdict was silent on the charge of first degree \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 199]\n\u00a0\n murder. The court entered judgment on the verdict, and sentenced petitioner to terms of imprisonment of one to three years on the first count of the indictment and five to twenty years on the second count.\n\nPetitioner appealed his conviction of second degree murder, contending that there was no evidence to support a verdict for that offense. The Court of Appeals sustained this claim. It reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial on the ground that, since there was no basis in the evidence for finding petitioner guilty of murder in the second degree, it was error to instruct the jury on that issue. 95 U.S. App. D.C. 45, 218 F.2d 856.\n2\n Petitioner was retried on the second count of the indictment, convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to death. The Court of Appeals, the nine judges sitting en banc, affirmed this conviction, rejecting petitioner's contention that he had been put twice in jeopardy of his life in violation of the Federal Constitution, 98 U.S. App. D.C. 413, 236 F.2d 708, Chief Judge Edgerton and Judges Bazelon and Fahy dissenting.\n\nSince the prohibition in the Constitution against double jeopardy is derived from history, its significance and scope must be determined, \"not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering [its] . . . origin and the line of [its] . . . growth.\" Gompers v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 604, 610\n. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 200]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe origin of this constitutional protection is found in the common-law pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. In Vaux's Case, 4 Co. Rep. 44a, 45a, it was accepted as established that \"the life of a man shall not be twice put in jeopardy for one and the same offence, and that is the reason and cause that auterfoits acquitted or convicted of the same offence is a good plea . . . .\" Likewise Blackstone stated that \"the plea of auterfoits acquit, or a former acquittal, is grounded on this universal maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life, more than once, for the same offence. And hence it is allowed as a consequence, that when a man is once fairly found not guilty upon any indictment, or other prosecution, before any court having competent jurisdiction of the offence, he may plead such acquittal in bar of any subsequent accusation for the same crime.\" 4 Bl. Comm. 335. To try again one who had been previously convicted or acquitted of the same offense was \"abhorrent to the law of England.\" Regina v. Tancock, 13 Cox C. C. 217, 220; see The King v. Emden, 9 East 437, 445-447.\n\nA principle so deeply rooted in the law of England, as an indispensable requirement of a civilized criminal procedure, was inevitably part of the legal tradition of the English Colonists in America. The Massachusetts Body of Liberties of 1641, an early compilation of principles drawn from the statutes and common law of England, declared that, \"No man shall be twise sentenced by Civill Justice for one and the same Crime, offence, or Trespasse,\" and that \"Everie Action betweene partie and partie, and proceedings against delinquents in Criminall causes shall be briefly and distinctly entered on the Rolles of every Court by the Recorder thereof. That such actions be not afterwards brought againe to the vexation of any man.\" Colonial Laws of Massachusetts 43, 47. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 201]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThus the First Congress, which proposed the Bill of Rights, came to its task with a tradition against double jeopardy founded both on ancient precedents in the English law and on legislation that had grown out of colonial experience and necessities. The need for the principle's general protection was undisputed, though its scope was not clearly defined. Fear of the power of the newly established Federal Government required \"an explicit avowal in [the Constitution] . . . of some of the plainest and best established principles in relation to the rights of the citizens, and the rules of the common law.\" People v. Goodwin, 18 Johns. (N. Y.) 187, 202. Although many States in ratifying the Constitution had proposed amendments considered indispensable to secure the rights of the citizen against the Federal Government, New York alone proposed a prohibition against double jeopardy. This is not surprising in view of the fact that only in New Hampshire had the common-law principle been embodied in a constitutional provision. 2 Poore, Federal and State Constitutions, Colonial Charters and other Organic Laws (2d ed.), 1282. The bill of rights adopted by the New York convention, and transmitted to Congress with its ratification of the Constitution, included a declaration that, \"no Person ought to be put twice in Jeopardy of Life or Limb for one and the same Offence, nor, unless in case of impeachment, be punished more than once for the same Offence.\" Documents Illustrative of the Formation of the Union, H. R. Doc. No. 398, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. 1035. This declaration was doubtless before Madison when he drafted the constitutional amendments to be proposed to the States.\n\nThe terms in which Madison introduced into the House what became the specific provision that is our present concern were these: \"No person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 202]\n\u00a0\n or one trial for the same offence . . . .\" 1 Annals of Cong. 434. Debate on this provision in the Committee of the Whole evidenced a concern that the language should express what the members understood to be the established common-law principle. There was fear that, as proposed by Madison, it might be taken to prohibit a second trial even when sought by a defendant who had been convicted. Representative Benson of New York objected to the provision because he presumed it was meant to express the established principle \"that no man's life should be more than once put in jeopardy for the same offence; yet it was well known, that they were entitled to more than one trial.\" 1 Annals of Cong. 753. Others who spoke agreed that although of course there could be no second trial following an acquittal, the prohibition should not extend to a second trial when a conviction had been set aside. The provision as amended by the Senate, S. J., 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 77, and eventually ratified as part of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, was substantially in the language used by Representative Benson to express his understanding of the common law.\n\nThe question that had concerned the House in debating Madison's proposal, the relation between the prohibition against double jeopardy and the power to order a new trial following conviction, was considered at length by Mr. Justice Story, on circuit, in United States v. Gibert, 25 Fed. Cas. 1287, 1294-1303 (1834). The defendants in that case had been found guilty of robbery on the high seas, a capital offense, and moved for a new trial. Mr. Justice Story, after full consideration of the English and American authorities, concluded that the court had no power to grant a new trial when the first trial had been duly had on a valid indictment before a court of competent jurisdiction. According to his view, the prohibition against double jeopardy applied equally whether the defendant \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 203]\n\u00a0\n had been acquitted or convicted, and there was no exception for a case where the new trial was sought by the defendant for his own benefit. Earlier, Mr. Justice Story had himself taken a non-literal view of the constitutional provision in United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, where, writing for the Court, he found that discharge of a jury that had failed to agree was no bar to a second trial. See also 3 Story, Commentaries on The Constitution (1833), 659-660.\n\nStory's conclusion that English law prohibited, except in rare instances, granting a new trial after conviction of a felony was undoubtedly correct, see The King v. Mawbey, 6 T. R. 619, 638, and on occasion this result has been expressly made to depend on the maxim prohibiting double jeopardy. The Queen v. Murphy, 2 L. R. P. C. 535, 547-548; see The Attorney-General v. Bertrand, 1 L. R. P. C. 520, 531-534; but see The Queen v. Scaife, 17 Q. B. 238. To this day the Court of Criminal Appeals has ordinarily no power to order a new trial even after quashing a conviction on appeal by the defendant, Criminal Appeal Act, 7 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 4 (2), and repeated efforts to secure this power for the court have met with the argument that a new trial would, at least in spirit, offend the principle that a defendant may not be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense. See 176 H. L. Deb. (5th ser. 1952) 759-763.\n\nThe old practice of the English courts, and the position taken by Mr. Justice Story, however, was generally rejected in the United States. The power to grant a new trial in the most serious cases appears to have been exercised by many American courts from an early date in spite of provisions against double jeopardy. United States v. Fries, 3 Dall. 515 (treason); see People v. Morrison, 1 Parker's Crim. Rep. (N. Y.) 625, 626-643 (rape). In United States v. Keen, 26 Fed. Cas. 686, 687-690, a decision rendered only five years after United States v. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 204]\n\u00a0\n Gibert, supra, Mr. Justice McLean, on circuit, vigorously rejected the view that the constitutional provision prohibited a new trial on the defendant's motion after a conviction, or that it \"guarantees to him the right of being hung, to protect him from the danger of a second trial.\" See 26 Fed. Cas., at 690. Other federal courts that had occasion to consider the question also rejected Mr. Justice Story's position, see United States v. Williams, 28 Fed. Cas. 636, 641; United States v. Harding, 26 Fed. Cas. 131, 136-138, and statements by this Court cast serious doubt on its validity. See Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 173-174, and Mr. Justice Clifford dissenting at 201-204. In Hopt v. Utah, \n104 \nU.S. 631, 110\n U.S. 574, \n114 \nU.S. 488, 120\n U.S. 430, the defendant was in fact retried three times following reversals of his convictions.\n\nFinally, United States v. Ball, \n163 \nU.S. 662\n-671, expressly rejected the view that the double jeopardy provision prevented a second trial when a conviction had been set aside. Two of the defendants in the case had been convicted of murder, and on writ of error the judgments were reversed with directions to quash the indictment. The same defendants were then convicted on a new indictment. In affirming these convictions the Court said, \"it is quite clear that a defendant, who procures a judgment against him upon an indictment to be set aside, may be tried anew upon the same indictment, or upon another indictment, for the same offence of which he had been convicted.\" \n163 \nU.S., at 672\n. On a literal reading of the constitutional provision, with an eye exclusively to the interests of the defendants, they had been \"once in jeopardy,\" and were entitled to the benefit of a reversal of their convictions without the hazard of a new trial. The Court recognized, however, that such a wooden interpretation would distort the purposes of the constitutional provision to the prejudice of society's legitimate interest in convicting the guilty as much as, \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 205]\n\u00a0\n in United States v. Gibert, they had been distorted to the prejudice of the defendants. See also Murphy v. Massachusetts, \n177 \nU.S. 155, 158\n-160.\n\nThe precise question now here first came before a federal court in United States v. Harding, 26 Fed. Cas. 131. There three defendants had been jointly indicted and tried for murder. One was convicted of murder and two of manslaughter, and all moved for a new trial. A new trial was ordered for the defendant convicted of murder, and as to the other two defendants the case was continued to allow them to decide whether they would take a new trial or abide by their convictions. Mr. Justice Grier warned these defendants:\n\n\"You ought clearly to understand and weigh well the position in which you now stand. You have been once tried and acquitted of the higher grade of offence charged against you in this indictment, the penalty affixed to which is death; but . . . you have escaped. . . . But let me now solemnly warn you to consider well the choice you shall make. Another jury instead of acquitting you altogether, may find you guilty of the whole indictment, and thus your lives may become forfeit to the law.\" 26 Fed. Cas., at 138.\n\n\n In thus assuming that the defendants could be retried for the greater offense of murder without violating the prohibition against double jeopardy, Mr. Justice Grier evidently drew upon a familiar background and what he took to be established practice in the federal courts. To one versed in these traditions, the choice to which the defendants were put in abiding by their convictions or obtaining a new trial, on which the entire question of their guilt would be open to re-examination, seemed legally speaking a matter of course.\n\nNot until Trono v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 521\n (1905), more than fifty years after the Harding case, did the question \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 206]\n\u00a0\n that had there been passed upon by Mr. Justice Grier first come before this Court. Trono v. United States came here from the Philippine Islands. The plaintiffs in error had been proceeded against in a court of first instance on a complaint accusing them of murder in the first degree. They were acquitted of this charge, but convicted of the included offense of assault. They appealed to the Supreme Court of the Philippines, and that court, exercising a jurisdiction similar to that conferred by Spanish law on the former Audience to review the whole case both on the facts and the law, reversed the judgment of the court of first instance, convicted the plaintiffs in error of the crime of \"homicide,\" or murder in the second degree, and increased the punishment imposed by the court of first instance. The plaintiffs in error then sought review by this Court, claiming that the action of the Supreme Court of the Philippines had placed them twice in jeopardy in contravention of the declaration of rights contained in 5 of the Act of July 1, 1902, for the Government of the Philippines. The provision in the statute relied on by the plaintiffs in error declared that, \"no person for the same offense shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment . . . .\" 32 Stat. 692. This language, it will be noted, is substantially identical with that in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, upon which petitioner in the present case relies. Its legal relation to the Fifth Amendment calls for later consideration.\n\nThis Court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, holding that since the plaintiffs in error had appealed their convictions of the lower offense in order to secure a reversal, there was no bar to convicting them of the higher offense in proceedings in the appellate court that were tantamount to a new trial. After canvassing state and federal precedents, Mr. Justice Peckham concluded that, \"the better doctrine is that \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 207]\n\u00a0\n which does not limit the court or jury, upon a new trial, to a consideration of the question of guilt of the lower offense of which the accused was convicted on the first trial, but that the reversal of the judgment of conviction opens up the whole controversy and acts upon the original judgment as if it had never been.\" \n199 \nU.S., at 533\n. It was pointed out that in permitting retrial for the greater offense the Court only applied the principle laid down in United States v. Ball, supra, and that the result was justified not only on the theory that the accused had \"waived\" their right not to be retried, but also on the ground that, \"the constitutional provision was really never intended to, and, properly construed, does not cover, the case of a judgment under these circumstances, which has been annulled by the court at the request of the accused . . . .\" \n199 \nU.S., at 534\n.\n\nThe Court in Trono left no doubt that its decision did not turn on any surviving peculiarities of Spanish procedure, or on the fact that the plaintiffs in error relied on a statutory provision rather than on the Fifth Amendment itself. \"We may regard the question as thus presented,\" stated Mr. Justice Peckham, \"as the same as if it arose in one of the Federal courts in this country, where, upon an indictment for a greater offense, the jury had found the accused not guilty of that offense, but guilty of a lower one which was included in it, and upon an appeal from that judgment by the accused a new trial had been granted by the appellate court, and the question was whether, upon the new trial accorded, the accused could be again tried for the greater offense . . . .\" \n199 \nU.S., at 530\n. The dissenters did not dispute this view of the case, but on the contrary were concerned with the Court's holding precisely because of its constitutional implications. Mr. Justice Harlan adhered to the view he had taken in earlier cases that the Bill of Rights applied to the Islands, and Mr. Justice McKenna in the principal \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 208]\n\u00a0\n dissent observed that, \"Let it be remembered that we are dealing with a great right, I may even say a constitutional right, for the opinion of the court discusses the case as though it were from a Circuit Court of the United States.\" \n199 \nU.S., at 539\n.\n\nThe scope and significance of the Trono case is underscored by the Court's decision in Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100\n, rendered only a year before. That case also arose in the Philippine Islands. The plaintiff in error had been acquitted by the court of first instance of the offense with which he was charged. On appeal by the Government to the Supreme Court of the Islands, the judgment was reversed and the plaintiff in error convicted. In this Court both the Attorney General for the Philippines and the Solicitor General of the United States contended that 5 of the Act of July 1, 1902, which included the same prohibition against double jeopardy involved in the Trono case, should be construed in the light of the system of law prevailing in the Philippines before they were ceded to the United States. Brief for the Attorney General of the Philippines, pp. 6-16, 29-38; Brief for the Solicitor General, pp. 34-44. Under that jurisprudence, proceedings in the Supreme Court, or Audience, were regarded not as a new trial but as an extension of preliminary proceedings in the court of first instance. The entire proceedings constituted one continuous trial, and the jeopardy that attached in the court of first instance did not terminate until final judgment had been rendered by the Audience.\n\nThe Court rejected the Government's contention and held that the proceedings after acquittal had placed the accused twice in jeopardy. Whatever the Spanish tradition, the purpose of Congress was \"to carry some at least of the essential principles of American constitutional jurisprudence to these islands and to engraft them upon the law of this people, newly subject to our jurisdiction.\" \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 209]\n\u00a0\n \"This case does not . . . require determination of the question whether the jeopardy clause [of the Fifth Amendment] became the law of the islands . . . without Congressional action, as the act of Congress made it the law of these possessions when the accused was tried and convicted.\" \n195 \nU.S., at 121\n-122, 125. The Court also rejected the suggestion that the rights enumerated in the Act of Congress could have been used \"in any other sense than that which has been placed upon them in construing the instrument from which they were taken . . . .\" \n195 \nU.S., at 124\n. Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting, found the case \"of great importance, not only in its immediate bearing upon the administration of justice in the Philippines, but, since the words used in the Act of Congress are also in the Constitution, even more because the decision necessarily will carry with it an interpretation of the latter instrument.\" \n195 \nU.S., at 134\n.\n\nThe legislative history of the Philippine Bill of Rights, 5 of the Act of July 1, 1902, made inevitable the Court's conclusion that by its enactment Congress extended to the Islands the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment, notwithstanding surviving Spanish procedures, so that the Court should construe the statute as it would the constitutional provision itself. President McKinley, in his famous instructions to the Philippine Commission, dated April 7, 1900, drawn by a leader of the American Bar, Secretary of War Elihu Root, had stated that\n\n\"the Commission should bear in mind, and the people of the Islands should be made plainly to understand, that there are certain great principles of government which have been made the basis of our governmental system, which we deem essential to the rule of law and the maintenance of individual freedom, and of which they have, unfortunately, been denied the experience possessed by us; that there are also certain practical rules of government which \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 210]\n\u00a0\n we have found to be essential to the preservation of these great principles of liberty and law, and that these principles and these rules of government must be established and maintained in their islands for the sake of their liberty and happiness, however much they may conflict with the customs or laws of procedure with which they are familiar. It is evident that the most enlightened thought of the Philippine Islands fully appreciates the importance of these principles and rules, and they will inevitably within a short time command universal assent. Upon every division and branch of the Government of the Philippines, therefore, must be imposed these inviolable rules:\n\n\n \"That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation; that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense; that excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted; that no person shall be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense . . . .\" 1 Public Laws of the Philippine Commission, p. LXVI.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n As the Court pointed out, \"These principles were not taken from the Spanish law; they were carefully collated from our own Constitution, and embody almost verbatim the safeguards of that instrument for the protection of life and liberty.\" \n195 \nU.S., at 124\n. In the Act of July 1, 1902, Congress adopted, almost in the language of the President's instructions, the fundamental provisions he considered must be engrafted onto Philippine law, and the historical context in which Congress acted leaves no doubt that it was also actuated by the same purpose as the President, to extend to the Philippines \"certain great principles of government which have been made the basis of our governmental system . . . .\" 1 Public Laws of the Philippine Commission, p. LXVI. In the double jeopardy provision of 5 Congress did not fashion a novel principle specially adapted to Philippine conditions and different from what was familiar to American constitutional \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 212]\n\u00a0\n thought. On the contrary, it extended over those newly subject to our jurisdiction the specific command of the Fifth Amendment, as construed and developed in the decisions of this Court. The Court in the Kepner and Trono cases, therefore, following the statutory language itself, emphasized by its legislative history, construed the double jeopardy provision of 5 as though it were construing the same provision in the United States Constitution. See also Weems v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 349, 367\n-368. The background of these decisions, and the expressed understanding of the Court on the nature and scope of the provision construed, make them direct authority in all cases arising under the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe decision in Trono was emphatically a decision of the Court. Although Mr. Justice Holmes concurred in the result only, and not in the opinion of Mr. Justice Peckham, there can be no doubt of where he stood. He had dissented in the Kepner case on the ground that trial and retrial constituted one procedure entailing one continuous jeopardy, and that there could be no second jeopardy until a conviction or acquittal free from legal error had been obtained. He was dissatisfied with the opinion of Mr. Justice Peckham in the Trono case, therefore, not remotely because it upheld the accused's conviction of the greater offense, but because it did not go further and adopt the continuing jeopardy theory Mr. Justice Holmes had espoused in the Kepner case. If there was no double jeopardy for him when the Government appealed an acquittal, obviously there was none when the defendant appealed a conviction. Indeed, in Kepner he explicitly stated that he considered state cases that held the defendant could not be retried for the greater offense to be wrong.\n\nMany statements by this Court since Trono show that the principle of that case cannot in all good conscience \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 213]\n\u00a0\n be rested on the criminal procedure of the Philippine Islands, but on a construction of the Fifth Amendment itself, and as such binding on the entire federal judiciary. In Burton v. United States, \n202 \nU.S. 344, 378\n, a case arising in the continental United States, the Court referred to the principle established by the Trono decision without any suggestion that it was confined to cases arising in the Philippines. In Brantley v. Georgia, \n217 \nU.S. 284\n, the defendant was convicted of manslaughter under an indictment for murder. On appeal to the State Court of Appeals, the conviction was reversed and the defendant retried and convicted of murder. Although the case concerned the Due Process Clause, the Court comprehensively stated that this \"was not a case of twice in jeopardy under any view of the Constitution of the United States.\" \n217 \nU.S., at 285\n.\n\nOf special relevance is Stroud v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 15, 17\n-18. In that case the defendant was indicted for murder, and the jury returned a verdict of \"guilty as charged in the indictment without capital punishment.\" The judgment was reversed and a new trial had on which the defendant was again found guilty of murder, but without a recommendation against capital punishment. He was then sentenced to death. This Court expressly relied on Trono in affirming the judgment and rejecting the contention that the imposition of a greater punishment had placed the defendant twice in jeopardy. As a practical matter, and on any basis of human values, it is scarcely possible to distinguish a case in which the defendant is convicted of a greater offense from one in which he is convicted of an offense that has the same name as that of which he was previously convicted but carries a significantly different punishment, namely death rather than imprisonment.\n\nWhatever formal disclaimers may be made, neither Trono itself nor the reliance placed upon it for more than \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 214]\n\u00a0\n half a century permits any other conclusion than that the Court today overrules that decision. It does so, furthermore, in a case where the defendant's position is far less persuasive than it was in Trono. There the plaintiffs in error had been expressly acquitted of the greater offense, whereas in the present case petitioner relies on an \"implied acquittal\" based on his conviction of the lesser offense of second degree murder and the jury's silence on the greater offense. Surely the silence of the jury is not, contrary to the Court's suggestion, to be interpreted as an express finding that the defendant is not guilty of the greater offense. All that can with confidence be said is that the jury was in fact silent. Every trial lawyer and every trial judge knows that jury verdicts are not logical products, and are due to considerations that preclude accurate guessing or logical deduction. Insofar as state cases speak of the jury's silence as an \"acquittal,\" they give a fictional description of a legal result: that when a defendant is found guilty of a lesser offense under an indictment charging a more serious one, and he is content to accept this conviction, the State may not again prosecute him for the greater offense. A very different situation is presented, with considerations persuasive of a different legal result, when the defendant is not content with his conviction, but appeals and obtains a reversal. Due regard for these additional considerations is not met by stating, as though it were a self-evident proposition, that the jury's silence has, for all purposes, \"acquitted\" the defendant.\n\nMoreover, the error of the District Court, which was the basis for petitioner's appeal from his first conviction, was of a kind peculiarly likely to raise doubts that the jury on the first trial had made a considered determination of petitioner's innocence of first degree murder. By instructing on second degree murder when the evidence did not warrant a finding of such an offense, the court \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 215]\n\u00a0\n gave the jury an opportunity for compromise and lenity that should not have been available. The fact of the matter is that by finding petitioner guilty of arson under count one of the indictment, and of second degree murder under count two, the jury found him guilty of all the elements necessary to convict him of the first degree felony murder with which he was charged, but the judge's erroneous instruction permitted the jury, for its own undisclosed reason, to render an irrational verdict.\n\nWe should not be so unmindful, even when constitutional questions are involved, of the principle of stare decisis, by whose circumspect observance the wisdom of this Court as an institution transcending the moment can alone be brought to bear on the difficult problems that confront us. The question in the present case is effectively indistinguishable from that in Trono. Furthermore, we are not here called upon to weigh considerations generated by changing concepts as to minimum standards of fairness, which interpretation of the Due Process Clause inevitably requires. Instead, the defense of double jeopardy is involved, whose contours are the product of history. In this situation the passage of time is not enough, and the conviction borne to the mind of the rightness of an overturning decision must surely be of a highly compelling quality to justify overruling a well-established precedent when we are presented with no considerations fairly deemed to have been wanting to those who preceded us. Whatever might have been the allowable result if the question of retrying a defendant for the greater offense were here for the first time, to fashion a policy in favorem vitae, it is foreclosed by the decision in Trono v. United States.\n\nEven if the question were here for the first time, we would not be justified in erecting the holding of the present case as a constitutional rule. Yet the opinion of the Court treats the question, not as one within \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 216]\n\u00a0\n our supervisory jurisdiction over federal criminal procedure, but as a question answered by the Fifth Amendment itself, and which therefore even Congress cannot undertake to affect.\n\nSuch an approach misconceives the purposes of the double jeopardy provision, and without warrant from the Constitution makes an absolute of the interests of the accused in disregard of the interests of society. In Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319\n, we held that a State could permit the prosecution to appeal a conviction of second degree murder and on retrial secure a conviction of first degree murder without violating any \"fundamental principles of liberty and justice.\" Since the State's interest in obtaining a trial \"free from the corrosion of substantial legal error\" was sufficient to sustain the conviction of the greater offense after an appeal by the State, it would of course sustain such a conviction if the defendant had himself appealed. Although this case defined conduct permissible under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it cannot wisely be ignored in tracing the constitutional limits imposed on the Federal Government. Nor should we ignore the fact that a substantial body of opinion in the States permits what today the Court condemns as violative of a \"vital safeguard in our society.\"\n4\n The Court restricts Congress within limits \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 217]\n\u00a0\n that in the experience of many jurisdictions are not a part of the protection against double jeopardy or required by its underlying purpose, and have not been imposed \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 218]\n\u00a0\n upon the States in the exercise of their governmental powers.\n\nUndeniably the framers of the Bill of Rights were concerned to protect defendants from oppression and from \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 219]\n\u00a0\n efforts to secure, through the callousness of repeated prosecutions, convictions for whose justice no man could vouch. On the other hand, they were also aware of the countervailing interest in the vindication of criminal justice, which sets outer limits to the protections for those accused of crimes. Thus if a defendant appeals his conviction and obtains a reversal, all agree, certainly in this country, that he may be retried for the same offense. The reason is, obviously, not that the defendant has consented to the second trial - he would much prefer that the conviction be set aside and no further proceedings had - but that the continuation of the proceedings by an appeal, together with the reversal of the conviction, are sufficient to permit a re-examination of the issue of the defendant's guilt without doing violence to the purposes behind the Double Jeopardy Clause. The balance represented by that clause leaves free another appeal to law. Since the propriety of the original proceedings has been called in question by the defendant, a complete re-examination of the issues in dispute is appropriate and not unjust. In the circumstances of the present case, likewise, the reversal of petitioner's conviction was a sufficient reason to justify a complete new trial in order that both parties might have one free from errors claimed to be prejudicial. As Mr. Justice Peckham pointed out in Trono, \"the constitutional provision was really never intended to, and, properly construed, does not cover, the case of a judgment under these circumstances, which has been annulled by the court at the request of the accused . . . .\" \n199 \nU.S., at 534\n.\n\nI would affirm the judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In reversing petitioner's conviction the court observed that: \"In seeking a new trial at which - if the evidence is substantially as before - the jury will have no choice except to find him guilty of first degree murder or to acquit him, Green is manifestly taking a desperate chance. He may suffer the death penalty. At oral argument we inquired of his counsel whether Green clearly understood the possible consequence of success on this appeal, and were told the appellant, who is 64 years of age, says he prefers death to spending the rest of his life in prison. He is entitled to a new trial.\" 95 U.S. App. D.C. 45, 48, 218 F.2d 856, 859.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] These instructions were drawn up for the guidance of the Commission headed by William Howard Taft. In 1912, W. Cameron Forbes, then Governor General of the Philippines, asked Taft \"what the history of the formation of the Philippine policy was, who it was that had written the instructions by President McKinley to the Taft Commission. He informed me that this was the work of Secretary Root, who wrote the letter of instructions, after which \n\n[355 \nU.S. 184, 211]\n\u00a0\n he had read them over to him (Judge Taft) and other members of his Commission, and that some suggestions and modifications were made but that the main work was intact.\" 1 Forbes, The Philippine Islands, 130, n. 2. In an address in 1913, Taft stated that the instructions \"had a conspicuous place in the history of our relations to the Philippines, and a Congressional indorsement, given to but few documents in the whole history of our country. It secured to the Philippine people all the guaranties of our Bill of Rights except trial by jury and the right to bear arms. It was issued by President McKinley as commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy in the exercise of a power which Congress was glad to leave to him without intervention for four years. He had thus the absolute control of what should be done in the way of establishing government in the Philippine Islands, and this letter to Mr. Root was the fundamental law of a civil government established under military authority. Subsequently, in 1902, when Congress assumed responsibility, it formally adopted and expressly ratified this letter of instructions, and declared that it, as supplemented by the remaining provisions of the statute, should be the Constitution of the Government of the Philippine Islands, and the charter of the liberties of the Filipino people.\" 2 Forbes, The Philippine Islands, 500.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Of the 36 States that have considered the question, 19 permit retrial for the greater offense:\n\n Colorado. - See Young v.

UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 184\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1957\n\n\n\n\n1. \nThe three petitioners were convicted in a federal district court of violating 18 U.S.C. 371 by conspiring to defraud the United States by preventing the criminal prosecution of certain taxpayers for fraudulent tax evasion. They had succeeded in obtaining \"no prosecution\" rulings from the Bureau of Internal Revenue in 1948 and 1949, and their subsequent activities were directed at concealing the irregularities through which these rulings were obtained. They were not indicted until October 25, 1954. Held: If the main objective of the conspiracy was to obtain the \"no prosecution\" rulings, petitioners' prosecution was barred by the three-year statute of limitations, since no agreement to conceal the conspiracy after its accomplishment was shown or can be implied on the record in this case to have been a part of the conspiracy. Pp. 399-406.\n\n (a) After the central criminal purposes of a conspiracy have been attained, a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal the crime may not be implied from circumstantial evidence showing merely that the conspiracy was kept a secret and that the conspirators took care to cover up their crime in order to escape detection and punishment. Krulewitch v. United States, \n336 \nU.S. 440\n; Lutwak v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 604\n. Pp. 399-402.\n\n\n (b) On the record in this case, nothing more is shown than (1) a criminal conspiracy carried out in secrecy, (2) a continuation of the secrecy after accomplishment of the crime, and (3) attempts to cover up after the crime began to come to light. Pp. 402-404.\n\n\n (c) The duration of a conspiracy cannot be lengthened indefinitely for the purpose of the statute of limitations merely because the conspiracy is kept secret and the conspirators take steps to bury their traces, in order to avoid detection and punishment after the central criminal purpose has been accomplished. Pp. 399, 404-405.\n\n\n2. \nThe judge's charge to the jury was not adequate to justify petitioners' conviction on the theory that the main objective of the conspiracy was not merely to obtain the initial \"no prosecution\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 392]\n\u00a0\n rulings but to obtain final immunity of the taxpayers from criminal prosecution by preventing their prosecution until after expiration of the six-year statute of limitations applicable to their tax-evasion offenses, which did not expire until less than three years before petitioners were indicted for conspiracy - since the judge's charge left it open for the jury to convict even though it found merely (1) that the central aim of the conspiracy was accomplished in 1949, and (2) that the subsequent acts of concealment were motivated exclusively by petitioners' fear of a conspiracy prosecution. Pp. 406-415.\n\n3. \nPetitioner Halperin was also convicted on other counts of the indictment charging him with violating 18 U.S.C. 1503 by endeavoring corruptly to influence certain witnesses before a grand jury which was investigating matters involved in the conspiracy. At his trial, he answered certain questions in a manner consistent with innocence and then, over his objection, was subjected to cross-examination which revealed that he had refused to answer the same questions, on grounds of possible self-incrimination, while he was appearing before a grand jury, under subpoena, without benefit of counsel, without the right to summon witnesses and without any opportunity to cross-examine witnesses testifying against him. Held: In the circumstances of this case, it was prejudicial error for the trial judge to permit cross-examination of Halperin on his plea of the Fifth Amendment privilege before the grand jury. Raffel v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 494\n, distinguished. Pp. 415-424.\n\n 233 F.2d 556, reversed and remanded.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 184, Halperin v.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe three petitioners were convicted on Count 1 of an indictment brought under 18 U.S.C. 371\n1\n for conspiracy to defraud the United States with reference to certain tax matters. Petitioner Halperin was also convicted on Counts 5, 6, and 7 of the same indictment, charging him with violating 18 U.S.C. 1503\n2\n by endeavoring corruptly to influence certain witnesses before a grand jury which was investigating matters involved in the conspiracy charged in Count 1 of the indictment. Each petitioner was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined under Count 1. On each of Counts 5, 6, and 7, Halperin was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and a fine of $1,000, the prison sentences on these Counts and that on Count 1 to run concurrently. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, with the late Judge Frank dissenting. 233 F.2d 556. We granted certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 866\n, in order to resolve important questions relating to (a) the statute of limitations in conspiracy \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 394]\n\u00a0\n prosecutions, as to which the decision below was alleged to be in conflict with this Court's decisions in Krulewitch v. United States, \n336 \nU.S. 440\n, and Lutwak v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 604\n; and (b) the use on Halperin's cross-examination of his prior claim of the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination before a grand jury. For the reasons discussed hereafter, we conclude that these convictions must be reversed, and the petitioners granted a new trial.\n\nOn October 25, 1954, a grand jury returned an indictment, Count 1 of which charged petitioners and others with conspiring among themselves and with others \"to defraud the United States in the exercise of its governmental functions of administering the internal revenue laws and of detecting and prosecuting violations of the internal revenue laws free from bribery, unlawful impairment, obstruction, improper influence, dishonesty, fraud and corruption . . . .\" The indictment further charged that a part of the conspiracy was an agreement to conceal the acts of the conspirators.\n3\n Overt acts within three years of the date of the indictment were charged. Counts 5, 6, and 7 of the indictment charged petitioners with violating 18 U.S.C. 1503 in the manner already indicated.\n\nThe proofs at the trial presented a sordid picture of a ring engaged in the business of \"fixing\" tax fraud cases \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 395]\n\u00a0\n by the use of bribes and improper influence. In general outline, the petitioners' scheme, which is set forth in more detail in the Court of Appeals' opinion,\n4\n was as follows:\n\nIn 1947 and 1948 two New York business firms, Patullo Modes and Gotham Beef Co., were under investigation by the Bureau of Internal Revenue for suspected fraudulent tax evasion. Through intermediaries, both firms established contact with Halperin, a New York attorney, and his associates in law practice. Halperin in turn conducted negotiations on behalf of these firms with Grunewald, an \"influential\" friend in Washington, and reported that Grunewald, for a large cash fee, would undertake to prevent criminal prosecution of the taxpayers. Grunewald then used his influence with Bolich, an official in the Bureau, to obtain \"no prosecution\" rulings\n5\n in the two tax cases. These rulings were handed down in 1948 and 1949. Grunewald, through Halperin, was subsequently paid $60,000 by Gotham and $100,000 by Patullo.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nSubsequent activities of the conspirators were directed at concealing the irregularities in the disposition of the Patullo and Gotham cases. Bolich attempted to have the Bureau of Internal Revenue report on the Patullo case \"doctored,\" and careful steps were taken to cover up the traces of the cash fees paid to Grunewald. In 1951 a congressional investigation was started by the King Committee of the House of Representatives; the conspirators felt themselves threatened and took steps to hide their traces. Thus Bolich caused the disappearance \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 396]\n\u00a0\n of certain records linking him to Grunewald, and the taxpayers were repeatedly warned to keep quiet. In 1952 the taxpayers and the conspirators were called before a Brooklyn grand jury. Halperin attempted to induce the taxpayers not to reveal the conspiracy, and Grunewald asked his secretary not to talk to the grand jury. These attempts at concealment were, however, in vain. The taxpayers and some of Halperin's associates revealed the entire scheme, and petitioners' indictment and conviction followed.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe first question before us is whether the prosecution of these petitioners on Count 1 of the indictment was barred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe indictment in these cases was returned on October 25, 1954. It was therefore incumbent on the Government to prove that the conspiracy, as contemplated in the agreement as finally formulated, was still in existence on October 25, 1951, and that at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was performed after that date.\n9\n For where substantiation of a conspiracy charge \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 397]\n\u00a0\n requires proof of an overt act, it must be shown both that the conspiracy still subsisted within the three years prior to the return of the indictment, and that at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiratorial agreement was performed within that period. Hence, in both of these aspects, the crucial question in determining whether the statute of limitations has run is the scope of the conspiratorial agreement, for it is that which determines both the duration of the conspiracy, and whether the act relied on as an overt act may properly be regarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioners, in contending that this prosecution was barred by limitations, state that the object of the conspiratorial agreement was a narrow one: to obtain \"no prosecution\" rulings in the two tax cases. When these rulings were obtained, in October 1948 in the case of Gotham Beef, and in January 1949 in the case of Patullo Modes, the criminal object of the conspiracy, petitioners say, was attained and the conspirators' function ended. They argue, therefore, that the statute of limitations started running no later than January 1949, and that the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 398]\n\u00a0\n prosecution was therefore barred by 1954, when the indictment was returned.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government counters with two principal contentions: First, it urges that even if the main object of the conspiracy was to obtain decisions from the Bureau of Internal Revenue not to institute criminal tax prosecutions - decisions obtained in 1948 and 1949 - the indictment alleged,\n12\n and the proofs showed, that the conspiracy also included as a subsidiary element an agreement to conceal the conspiracy to \"fix\" these tax cases, to the end that the conspirators would escape detection and punishment for their crime. Says the Government, \"from the very nature of the conspiracy . . . there had to be, and was, from the outset a conscious, deliberate, agreement to conceal . . . each and every aspect of the conspiracy . . . .\" It is then argued that since the alleged conspiracy to conceal clearly continued long after the main criminal purpose of the conspiracy was accomplished, and since overt acts in furtherance of the agreement to conceal were performed well within the indictment period, the prosecution was timely.\n\nSecond, and alternatively, the Government contends that the central aim of the conspiracy was to obtain \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 399]\n\u00a0\n for these taxpayers, not merely a \"no prosecution\" ruling, but absolute immunity from tax prosecution; in other words, that the objectives of the conspiracy were not attained until 1952, when the statute of limitations ran on the tax cases which these petitioners undertook to \"fix.\" The argument then is that since the conspiracy did not end until 1952, and since the 1949-1952 acts of concealment may be regarded as, at least in part, in furtherance of the objective of the conspirators to immunize the taxpayers from tax prosecution, the indictment was timely.\n\nFor reasons hereafter given, we hold that the Government's first contention must be rejected, and that as to its second, which the Court of Appeals accepted, a new trial must be ordered.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nWe think that the Government's first theory - that an agreement to conceal a conspiracy can, on facts such as these, be deemed part of the conspiracy and can extend its duration for the purposes of the statute of limitations - has already been rejected by this Court in Krulewitch v. United States, \n336 \nU.S. 440\n, and in Lutwak v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 604\n.\n\nIn Krulewitch the question before the Court was whether certain hearsay declarations could be introduced against one of the conspirators. The declarations in question were made by one named in the indictment as a co-conspirator after the main object of the conspiracy (transporting a woman to Florida for immoral purposes) had been accomplished. The Government argued that the conspiracy was not ended, however, since it included an implied subsidiary conspiracy to conceal the crime after its commission, and that the declarations were therefore still in furtherance of the conspiracy and binding on \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 400]\n\u00a0\n co-conspirators. This Court rejected the Government's argument. It then stated:\n\n\"Conspirators about to commit crimes always expressly or implicitly agree to collaborate with each other to conceal facts in order to prevent detection, conviction and punishment. Thus the [Government's] argument is that even after the central criminal objectives of a conspiracy have succeeded or failed, an implicit subsidiary phase of the conspiracy always survives, the phase which has concealment as its sole objective.\n\n\n \"We cannot accept the Government's contention. . . . The rule contended for by the Government could have far-reaching results. For under this rule plausible arguments could generally be made in conspiracy cases that most out-of-court statements offered in evidence tended to shield co-conspirators. We are not persuaded to adopt the Government's implicit conspiracy theory which in all criminal conspiracy cases would create automatically a further breach of the general rule against the admission of hearsay evidence.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n Mr. Justice Jackson, concurring, added:\n\n \"I suppose no person planning a crime would accept as a collaborator one on whom he thought he could not rely for help if he were caught, but I doubt that this fact warrants an inference of conspiracy for that purpose. . . .\n\n\n \"It is difficult to see any logical limit to the `implied conspiracy,' either as to duration or means . . . . On the theory that the law will impute to the confederates a continuing conspiracy to defeat justice, one conceivably could be bound by \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 401]\n\u00a0\n another's unauthorized and unknown commission of perjury, bribery of a juror or witness, [etc.] . . . .\n\n\n \"Moreover, the assumption of an indefinitely continuing offense would result in an indeterminate extension of the statute of limitations. If the law implies an agreement to cooperate in defeating prosecution, it must imply that it continues as long as prosecution is a possibility, and prosecution is a possibility as long as the conspiracy to defeat it is implied to continue.\"\n14\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Krulewitch case was reaffirmed in Lutwak v. United States, supra. Here again the question was the admissibility of hearsay declarations of co-conspirators after the main purpose of the conspiracy had been accomplished; again the Government attempted to extend the life of the conspiracy by an alleged subsidiary conspiracy to conceal. Although in Lutwak, unlike in Krulewitch, the existence of a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal was charged in the indictment, the Court again rejected the Government's theory, holding that no such agreement to conceal had been proved or could be implied.\n\nThe Government urges us to distinguish Krulewitch and Lutwak on the ground that in those cases the attempt was to imply a conspiracy to conceal from the mere fact that the main conspiracy was kept secret and that overt acts of concealment occurred. In contrast, says the Government, here there was an actual agreement to conceal the conspirators, which was charged and proved to be an express part of the initial conspiracy itself.\n\nWe are unable to agree with the Government that, on this record, the cases before us can be distinguished on such a basis.\n\nThe crucial teaching of Krulewitch and Lutwak is that after the central criminal purposes of a conspiracy have \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 402]\n\u00a0\n been attained, a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal may not be implied from circumstantial evidence showing merely that the conspiracy was kept a secret and that the conspirators took care to cover up their crime in order to escape detection and punishment. As was there stated, allowing such a conspiracy to conceal to be inferred or implied from mere overt acts of concealment would result in a great widening of the scope of conspiracy prosecutions, since it would extend the life of a conspiracy indefinitely. Acts of covering up, even though done in the context of a mutually understood need for secrecy, cannot themselves constitute proof that concealment of the crime after its commission was part of the initial agreement among the conspirators. For every conspiracy is by its very nature secret; a case can hardly be supposed where men concert together for crime and advertise their purpose to the world. And again, every conspiracy will inevitably be followed by actions taken to cover the conspirators' traces. Sanctioning the Government's theory would for all practical purposes wipe out the statute of limitations in conspiracy cases, as well as extend indefinitely the time within which hearsay declarations will bind co-conspirators.\n\nA reading of the record before us reveals that on the facts of this case the distinction between \"actual\" and \"implied\" conspiracies to conceal, as urged upon us by the Government, is no more than a verbal tour de force. True, in both Krulewitch and Lutwak there is language in the opinions stressing the fact that only an implied agreement to conceal was relied on.\n15\n Yet when we look to the facts of the present cases, we see that the evidence from which the Government here asks us to deduce an \"actual\" agreement to conceal reveals nothing beyond that adduced in prior cases. What is this evidence? \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 403]\n\u00a0\n First, we have the fact that from the beginning the conspirators insisted on secrecy. Thus the identities of Grunewald and Bolich were sedulously kept from the taxpayers; careful steps were taken to hide the conspiracy from an independent law firm which was also working on Patullo's tax problems; and the taxpayers were told to make sure that their books did not reflect the large cash payments made to Grunewald. Secondly, after the \"no prosecution\" rulings were obtained, we have facts showing that this secrecy was still maintained. Thus, a deliberate attempt was made to make the above-mentioned independent law firm believe that it was its (quite legitimate) efforts which produced the successful ruling. Finally, we have the fact that great efforts were made to conceal the conspiracy when the danger of exposure appeared. For example, Bolich got rid of certain records showing that he had used Grunewald's hotel suite in Washington; Patullo's accountant was persuaded to lie to the grand jury concerning a check made out to an associate of the conspirators; Grunewald attempted to persuade his secretary not to talk to the grand jury; and the taxpayers were repeatedly told by Halperin and his associates to keep quiet.\n\nWe find in all this nothing more than what was involved in Krulewitch, that is, (1) a criminal conspiracy which is carried out in secrecy; (2) a continuation of the secrecy after the accomplishment of the crime; and (3) desperate attempts to cover up after the crime begins to come to light; and so we cannot agree that this case does not fall within the ban of those prior opinions.\n\nIn effect, the differentiation pressed upon us by the Government is one of words rather than of substance. In Krulewitch it was urged that a continuing agreement to conceal should be implied out of the mere fact of conspiracy, and that acts of concealment should be taken as overt acts in furtherance of that implied agreement to \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 404]\n\u00a0\n conceal. Today the Government merely rearranges the argument. It states that the very same acts of concealment should be used as circumstantial evidence from which it can be inferred that there was from the beginning an \"actual\" agreement to conceal. As we see it, the two arguments amount to the same thing: a conspiracy to conceal is being implied from elements which will be present in virtually every conspiracy case, that is, secrecy plus overt acts of concealment.\n16\n There is not a shred of direct evidence in this record to show anything like an express original agreement among the conspirators to continue to act in concert in order to cover up, for their own self-protection, traces of the crime after its commission.\n\nPrior cases in this Court have repeatedly warned that we will view with disfavor attempts to broaden the already pervasive and wide-sweeping nets of conspiracy prosecutions.\n17\n The important considerations of policy behind such warnings need not be again detailed. See Jackson, J., concurring in Krulewitch v. United States, supra. It is these considerations of policy which govern our holding today. As this case was tried, we have before us a typical example of a situation where the Government, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 405]\n\u00a0\n faced by the bar of the three-year statute, is attempting to open the very floodgates against which Krulewitch warned. We cannot accede to the proposition that the duration of a conspiracy can be indefinitely lengthened merely because the conspiracy is kept a secret, and merely because the conspirators take steps to bury their traces, in order to avoid detection and punishment after the central criminal purpose has been accomplished.\n\nBy no means does this mean that acts of concealment can never have significance in furthering a criminal conspiracy. But a vital distinction must be made between acts of concealment done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy, and acts of concealment done after these central objectives have been attained, for the purpose only of covering up after the crime. Thus the Government argues in its brief that \"in the crime of kidnapping, the acts of conspirators in hiding while waiting for ransom would clearly be planned acts of concealment which would be in aid of the conspiracy to kidnap. So here, there can be no doubt that . . . all acts of concealment, whether to hide the identity of the conspirators or the action theretofore taken, were unquestionably in furtherance of the initial conspiracy . . . .\" We do not think the analogy is valid. Kidnappers in hiding, waiting for ransom, commit acts of concealment in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy itself, just as repainting a stolen car would be in furtherance of a conspiracy to steal; in both cases the successful accomplishment of the crime necessitates concealment.\n18\n More closely analogous to our case would be conspiring kidnappers who cover their traces after the main conspiracy is finally ended - i. e., after they have abandoned the kidnaped person and then take care to escape detection. In the latter case, as here, the acts of covering up can by \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 406]\n\u00a0\n themselves indicate nothing more than that the conspirators do not wish to be apprehended - a concomitant, certainly, of every crime since Cain attempted to conceal the murder of Abel from the Lord.\n\nWe hold, therefore, that, considering the main objective of the conspiracy to have been the obtaining of \"no prosecution\" rulings, prosecution was barred by the three-year statute of limitations, since no agreement to conceal the conspiracy after its accomplishment was shown or can be implied on the evidence before us to have been part of the conspiratorial agreement.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nIn view of how the case was submitted to the jury, we are also unable to accept the Government's second theory for avoiding the statute of limitations. This theory is (1) that the main objective of the conspiracy was not merely to obtain the initial \"no prosecution\" rulings in 1948 and 1949, but to obtain final immunity for Gotham and Patullo from criminal tax prosecution; (2) that such immunity was not obtained until 1952, when the statute of limitations had run on the tax-evasion cases which the petitioners conspired to fix;\n19\n (3) that the conspiracy therefore did not end until 1952, when this object was attained; (4) that the acts of concealment within the indictment period were overt acts in furtherance of this conspiracy; and (5) that the prosecution was thus timely.\n20\n In short, the contention is that the agreement \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 407]\n\u00a0\n to conceal was to protect the taxpayers rather than the conspirators, and as such was part of the main conspiracy rather than a subsidiary appendage to it, as under the Government's first theory.\n\nThe Court of Appeals accepted this theory of the case in affirming these convictions. It stated:\n\n\"What the fixers had to sell was freedom from criminal prosecution for tax frauds. What the taxpayers bargained for was protection from a tax evasion prosecution.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n  \"This conspiracy is wholly unlike the ordinary illegal scheme in that the jury may well have inferred that the official announcement that there would be no criminal prosecution of the taxpayers \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 408]\n\u00a0\n was merely the delivery of a substantial installment of what appellants agreed to deliver for the huge sums paid. The six-year Statute of Limitations . . . did not run in favor of the taxpayers until some time after the commission of the overt acts relied upon. In the interval there was no assurance, other than continuing efforts by Grunewald, Bolich and the others, that the whole nefarious business might not be brought to light, followed by the revocation of the decision not to criminally prosecute the taxpayers. This is a significant element in the proofs adduced by the government, as concealment of the conspiratorial acts was necessary not only to protect the conspirators from a conspiracy prosecution but also to protect the taxpayers from a tax evasion prosecution.\" 233 F.2d, at 564-565.\n\n\n We find the legal theory of the Court of Appeals unexceptionable. If the central objective of the conspiracy was to protect the taxpayers from tax-evasion prosecutions, on which the statute of limitations did not run until 1952, and if the 1948 and 1949 \"no prosecution\" rulings were but an \"installment\" of what the conspirators aimed to accomplish, then it is clear that the statute of limitations on the conspiracy did not begin to run until 1952, within three years of the indictment.\n21\n\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, we agree with the Court of Appeals that there is evidence in this record which would warrant submission of the case to the jury on the theory that the central object of the conspiracy was not attained in 1948 and 1949, but rather was to immunize the taxpayers completely from prosecution for tax evasion and thus continued into 1952. The many overt acts of concealment occurring after 1949 could easily have been motivated at \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 409]\n\u00a0\n least in part by the purpose of the conspirators to deliver the remaining \"installments\" owing under the bargain - to wit, the safeguarding of the continued vitality of the \"no prosecution\" rulings.\n22\n Furthermore, there is evidence showing that from the beginning the aim of the scheme was not restricted to the merely provisional and necessarily precarious \"fixing\" of the taxpayers' troubles which was achieved in 1948 and 1949.\n23\n A jury might therefore \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 410]\n\u00a0\n fairly infer that it was part of the conspiratorial agreement that Grunewald and Bolich would make continuing efforts to safeguard the fruits of the partial victories won in 1948 and 1949 by trying to immunize the \"no prosecution\" rulings from change. In other words, we think a jury could infer from this evidence that the conspirators were prepared and had agreed to engage in further frauds and bribery if necessary in order to maintain in effect the tentative rulings obtained in 1948 and 1949.\n24\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 411]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf, therefore, the jury could have found that the aim of the conspiratorial agreement was to protect the taxpayers from tax prosecution, and that the overt acts occurring in the indictment period were in furtherance of that aim, we would affirm. We do not think, however, that we may safely assume that the jury so found, for we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals' holding that this theory of the case was adequately submitted to the jury.\n\nThe trial judge's charge on the problem of the scope and duration of the conspiracy was as follows:\n\n \"You will recall that the indictment states, among other things, that it was part of the conspiracy that the defendants and co-conspirators would make `continuing efforts to avoid detection and prosecution by any governmental body, executive, legislative, and judicial of tax frauds perpetrated by the defendants and co-conspirators through the use of any means whatsoever including but not limited to . . . the influencing, intimidating, and impeding of prospective witnesses to refrain from disclosing the true facts.' In other words, the indictment alleges that the conspiracy comprehended within it a conspiracy to conceal the true facts from investigation, should investigation thereafter eventuate. This is an important element of the first count of the indictment which you must take into consideration, inasmuch as the Statute of Limitations on the charge of criminal conspiracy is three years and unless the conspiracy was continuing to a period within three years prior to the date of the indictment, October 25, 1954, and some overt act was performed within that three-year period, the crime, if any, alleged in the first count of the indictment would be outlawed. It is the contention of the government that the conspiracy did not end when the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 412]\n\u00a0\n taxpayers were advised that there would be no criminal prosecution recommended by the Special Agent's office, but that an integral part of the entire conspiracy was an agreement to conceal the acts of the conspirators and that when thereafter an investigation was started by Congress and by the Grand Jury in the Eastern District of New York, the conspirators performed overt acts in pursuance of the original conspiracy designed to conceal the true facts; and that these acts occurred within three years prior to the date of the indictment. On this issue, it will be necessary for you to determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, you can conclude that the conspiracy was of the nature described in the first count of the indictment and comprehended an agreement to conceal and whether some overt act took place in the period of three years prior to October 25, 1954 to carry out such purpose of the conspiracy.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"To determine whether certain of the alleged overt acts were in furtherance of the object of the conspiracy, you have to determine the duration of the conspiracy. Did it end when the Patullo [sic] Modes people and the Gotham Beef people received an assurance of no prosecution from the Bureau of Internal Revenue, or was a part of the conspiracy a continuing agreement to conceal the acts done pursuant thereto? In determining whether a part of the conspiracy was an agreement to continue to conceal the illegal acts after their consummation, you may not imply that such an agreement was part of the conspiracy. You would have to find from the evidence of the acts and declarations of the co-conspirators that there was an understanding or agreement to conceal the conspiracy. If you find that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 413]\n\u00a0\n such an agreement or understanding to conceal the conspiracy was not a part of the conspiracy to defraud the government, but no more than an afterthought brought to the surface when the co-conspirators were confronted with the Grand Jury and King Committee investigations, then you must find, as a matter of law, that the defendants are not guilty of the crime charged in the first count of the indictment. If you find that the evidence shows, beyond a reasonable doubt, that as a part of a conspiracy to defraud the government, there was an agreement or understanding to conceal the illegal acts and that this too was an objective or part of the conspiracy, then you may find that such understanding was a part of the conspiracy. However, you must additionally determine whether this objective of the conspiracy was known to the defendants. If this objective was known originally by only part of the conspirators but thereafter during the existence of the conspiracy, the scope of the conspiracy was extended so as to include such an agreement to conceal, and if you find that some of the defendants did not know of the expansion to include the agreement to conceal, you may not impute to them the knowledge of their co-conspirators and they could not be found guilty of the crime charged in Count One.\"\n\n\n We are constrained to agree with Judge Frank that this charge did not adequately enlighten the jury as to what they would have to find in order to conclude that the conspiracy was still alive after October 25, 1951. For the charge as given failed completely to distinguish between concealment in order to achieve the central purpose of the conspiracy (that is, the immunization of the taxpayers from tax-evasion prosecution), and concealment intended solely to cover up an already executed crime \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 414]\n\u00a0\n (that is, the obtaining of the \"no prosecution\" rulings). The jury was never told that these overt acts of concealment could be taken as furthering the conspiracy only if the basic criminal aim of the conspiracy was not yet attained in 1949. On the charge as given, the jury might easily have concluded that the petitioners were guilty even though they found merely (1) that the central aim of the conspiracy was accomplished in 1949, and (2) that the subsequent acts of concealment were motivated exclusively by the conspirators' fear of a conspiracy prosecution. As far as we know, therefore, the present convictions were based on the impermissible theory discussed in the first part of this opinion - namely, that a subordinate agreement to conceal the conspiracy continued after the central aim of the conspiracy had been accomplished.\n\nFurthermore, if the convictions were based on a finding that the overt acts of concealment were done with the single intention of protecting the conspirators' own interests, then it is irrelevant that these acts in fact happened to have the effect also of protecting the taxpayers against revocation of the \"no prosecution\" rulings. For overt acts in a prosecution such as this one are meaningful only if they are within the scope of the conspiratorial agreement. If that agreement did not, expressly or impliedly, contemplate that the conspiracy would continue in its efforts to protect the taxpayers in order to immunize them from tax prosecution, then the scope of the agreement cannot be broadened retroactively by the fact that the conspirators took steps after the conspiracy which incidentally had that effect.\n\nWe thus find that the judge's charge left it open for the jury to convict even though they found that the acts of concealment were motivated purely by the purpose of the conspirators to cover up their already accomplished crime. And this, we think, was fatal error. For the facts in this record are equivocal. The jury might easily have \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 415]\n\u00a0\n concluded that the aim of the conspiracy was accomplished in 1949, and that the overt acts of concealment occurring after that date were done pursuant to the alleged conspiracy to hide the conspirators. As we have said, a conviction on such a theory could not be sustained. Under such circumstances, therefore, it was essential for the judge to charge clearly and unequivocally that on these facts the jury could not infer a continuing conspiracy to conceal the conspiracy, whether actual or implied. Further, it was incumbent on the judge to charge that in order to convict the jury would have to find that the central aim of the conspiracy was to immunize the taxpayers from tax prosecution, that this objective continued in being through 1951, and that the overt acts of concealment proved at trial were at least partly calculated to further this aim.\n\nSince, under the judge's charge, the convictions on Count 1 might have rested on an impermissible ground, we conclude that they cannot stand, and the petitioners must be given a new trial as to this Count.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nWhat we have held as to the statute of limitations disposes of the conviction of the three petitioners under Count 1, but does not touch Halperin's conviction on Counts 5, 6, and 7 for violating 18 U.S.C. 1503.\n25\n As to those Counts, Halperin, who took the stand in his own defense at the trial, contends (a) that the Government was improperly allowed to cross-examine him as to the assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege before a grand jury investigating this conspiracy, before which he had been called as a witness,\n26\n and (b) that the evidence did \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 416]\n\u00a0\n not justify his conviction on these Counts. For the reasons given hereafter we think that the first contention is well taken, but that the second one is untenable.\n\nIn 1952 Halperin was subpoenaed before a Brooklyn grand jury which was investigating corruption in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Testimony had already been received by the grand jury from the Patullo and Gotham taxpayers, which linked Halperin with the tax-fixing ring. Halperin was asked a series of questions before the grand jury, including, among others, such questions as whether he knew Max Steinberg (an employee of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and a co-defendant in the charge under Count 1); whether he knew Grunewald; whether he had held and delivered escrow money paid to Grunewald by Gotham after the \"no prosecution\" ruling; and whether he had phoned Grunewald to arrange a meeting between one of his own associates and Bolich. Halperin declined to answer any of these questions, on the ground that the answers would tend to incriminate him and that the Fifth Amendment therefore entitled him not to answer. He repeatedly insisted before the grand jury that he was wholly innocent, and that he pleaded his Fifth Amendment privilege only on the advice of counsel that answers to these questions might furnish evidence which could be used against him, particularly when he was not represented by counsel and could not cross-examine witnesses before the grand jury.\n\nWhen the Government cross-examined Halperin at the trial some of the questions which he had been asked before the grand jury were put to him.\n27\n He answered \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 417]\n\u00a0\n each question in a way consistent with innocence. The Government was then allowed, over objection, to bring out in cross-examination that petitioner had pleaded his privilege before the grand jury as to these very questions. Later, in his charge to the jury, the trial judge informed them that petitioner's Fifth Amendment plea could be taken only as reflecting on his credibility, and that no inference as to guilt or innocence could be drawn therefrom as to Halperin or any co-defendant.\n28\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 418]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn thus allowing this cross-examination, the District Court relied on Raffel v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 494\n, where this Court held that a defendant's failure to take the stand at his first trial to deny testimony as to an incriminating admission could be used on cross-examination at the second trial, where he did take the stand, to impugn the credibility of his denial of the same admission. In upholding the District Court here, the Court of Appeals likewise relied on Raffel, and also on one of its own earlier decisions.\n29\n Halperin attacks these rulings on these principal grounds: (a) Raffel is distinguishable from the present case; (b) if Raffel permitted this cross-examination, then the trial court erred in refusing to charge, as Halperin requested, that \"an innocent man may honestly claim that his answers may tend to incriminate him\"; (c) in any case Raffel has impliedly been overruled by Johnson v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 189\n; and (d) compelling Halperin to testify before the grand jury, when he had already been marked as a putative defendant, violated his constitutional rights, so that, by analogy to the rule of Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, his claim of privilege could in no event be used against him. We find that in the circumstances presented here Raffel is not controlling, and that this cross-examination was not permissible.\n\nIt is, of course, an elementary rule of evidence that prior statements may be used to impeach the credibility of a criminal defendant or an ordinary witness. But this can be done only if the judge is satisfied that the prior statements are in fact inconsistent. 3 Wigmore, Evidence, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 419]\n\u00a0\n 1040. And so the threshold question here is simply whether, in the circumstances of this case, the trial court erred in holding that Halperin's plea of the Fifth Amendment privilege before the grand jury involved such inconsistency with any of his trial testimony as to permit its use against him for impeachment purposes.\n30\n We do not think that Raffel is properly to be read either as dispensing with the need for such preliminary scrutiny by the judge, or as establishing as a matter of law that such a prior claim of privilege with reference to a question \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 420]\n\u00a0\n later answered at the trial is always to be deemed to be a prior inconsistent statement, irrespective of the circumstances under which the claim of privilege was made. The issue decided in Raffel came to the Court as a certified question in quite an abstract form,\n31\n and was really centered on the question whether a defendant who takes the stand on a second trial can continue to take advantage of the privilege asserted at the first trial. This Court held, in effect, that when a criminal defendant takes the stand, he waives his privilege completely and becomes subject to cross-examination impeaching his credibility just like any other witness: \"His waiver is not partial; having once cast aside the cloak of immunity, he may not resume it at will, whenever cross-examination may be inconvenient or embarrassing.\" The Court, in Raffel, did not focus on the question whether the cross-examination there involved was in fact probative in impeaching the defendant's credibility. In other words, we may assume that under Raffel Halperin in this case was subject to cross-examination impeaching his credibility just like any other witness, and that his Fifth Amendment plea before the grand jury could not carry over any form of immunity when he voluntarily took the stand at the trial. This does not, however, solve the question whether in the particular circumstances of this case the cross-examination should have been excluded because its probative value on the issue of Halperin's credibility was so negligible as to be far outweighed by its possible impermissible impact on the jury.\n32\n As we consider that in the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 421]\n\u00a0\n circumstances of the present case, the trial court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, should have refused to permit this line of cross-examination, we are not faced with the necessity of deciding whether Raffel has been stripped of vitality by the later Johnson case, supra, or of otherwise re-examining Raffel.\n\nWe need not tarry long to reiterate our view that, as the two courts below held, no implication of guilt could be drawn from Halperin's invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege before the grand jury. Recent re-examination of the history and meaning of the Fifth Amendment has emphasized anew that one of the basic functions of the privilege is to protect innocent men. Griswold, The Fifth Amendment Today, 9-30, 53-82. \"Too many, even those who should be better advised, view this privilege as a shelter for wrongdoers. They too readily assume that those who invoke it are either guilty of crime or commit perjury in claiming the privilege.\" Ullmann v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 422, 426\n. See also Slochower v. Board of Higher Education, \n350 \nU.S. 551\n, when, at the same Term, this Court said at pp. 557-558: \"The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\"\n\nWhen we pass to the issue of credibility, we deem it evident that Halperin's claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege before the Brooklyn grand jury in response to questions which he answered at the trial was wholly consistent with innocence. Had he answered the questions put to him before the grand jury in the same way he subsequently answered them at trial, this nevertheless \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 422]\n\u00a0\n would have provided the Government with incriminating evidence from his own mouth. For example, had he stated to the grand jury that he knew Grunewald, the admission would have constituted a link between him and a criminal conspiracy, and this would be true even though he was entirely innocent and even though his friendship with Grunewald was above reproach. There was, therefore, as we see it, no inconsistency between Halperin's statement to the grand jury that answering the question whether he knew Grunewald would tend to furnish incriminating evidence against him, and his subsequent testimony at trial that his acquaintance with Grunewald was free of criminal elements. And the same thing is also true, as we see it, as to his claim of privilege with respect to the other questions asked him before the grand jury and his answers to those same questions when they were put to him at the trial. These conclusions are fortified by a number of other considerations surrounding Halperin's claim of privilege:\n\nFirst, Halperin repeatedly insisted before the grand jury that he was innocent and that he pleaded his Fifth Amendment privilege solely on the advice of counsel.\n\nSecond, the Fifth Amendment claim was made before a grand jury where Halperin was a compelled, and not a voluntary, witness; where he was not represented by counsel; where he could summon no witnesses; and where he had no opportunity to cross-examine witnesses testifying against him. These factors are crucial in weighing whether a plea of the privilege is inconsistent with later exculpatory testimony on the same questions, for the nature of the tribunal which subjects the witness to questioning bears heavily on what inferences can be drawn from a plea of the Fifth Amendment. See Griswold, supra, at 62. Innocent men are more likely to plead the privilege in secret proceedings, where they testify \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 423]\n\u00a0\n without advice of counsel and without opportunity for cross-examination, than in open court proceedings, where cross-examination and judicially supervised procedure provide safeguards for the establishing of the whole, as against the possibility of merely partial, truth.\n\nFinally, and most important, we cannot deem Halperin's plea of the Fifth Amendment to be inconsistent with his later testimony at the trial because of the nature of this particular grand-jury proceeding. For, when Halperin was questioned before the grand jury, he was quite evidently already considered a potential defendant. The taxpayers whose cases had been \"fixed\" by the conspiratorial ring had already testified before the grand jury, and they gave there largely the same evidence as they did later, at trial. The scheme was thus in essence already revealed when Halperin was called to testify. Under these circumstances it was evident that Halperin was faced with the possibility of an early indictment, and it was quite natural for him to fear that he was being asked questions for the very purpose of providing evidence against himself. It was thus quite consistent with innocence for him to refuse to provide evidence which could be used by the Government in building its incriminating chain. For many innocent men who know that they are about to be indicted will refuse to help create a case against themselves under circumstances where lack of counsel's assistance and lack of opportunity for cross-examination will prevent them from bringing out the exculpatory circumstances in the context of which superficially incriminating acts occurred.\n\nWe are not unmindful that the question whether a prior statement is sufficiently inconsistent to be allowed to go to the jury on the question of credibility is usually within the discretion of the trial judge. But where such evidentiary matter has grave constitutional overtones, as \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 424]\n\u00a0\n it does here, we feel justified in exercising this Court's supervisory control to pass on such a question. This is particularly so because in this case the dangers of impermissible use of this evidence far outweighed whatever advantage the Government might have derived from it if properly used. If the jury here followed the judge's instructions, namely, that the plea of the Fifth Amendment was relevant only to credibility, then the weight to be given this evidence was less than negligible, since, as we have outlined above, there was no true inconsistency involved; it could therefore hardly have affected the Government's case seriously to exclude the matter completely. On the other hand, the danger that the jury made impermissible use of the testimony by implicitly equating the plea of the Fifth Amendment with guilt is, in light of contemporary history, far from negligible. Weighing these factors, therefore, we feel that we should draw upon our supervisory power over the administration of federal criminal justice in order to rule on the matter. Cf. McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n.\n\nWe hold that under the circumstances of this case it was prejudicial error for the trial judge to permit cross-examination of petitioner on his plea of the Fifth Amendment privilege before the grand jury, and that Halperin must therefore be given a new trial on Counts 5, 6, and 7.\n\nFinally, we find no substance to Halperin's contention that he was in effect convicted for advising, as a lawyer, some of the witnesses before the grand jury that they had a right to plead their Fifth Amendment privilege. The evidence against Halperin under these Counts was quite sufficient to make out a case for submission to the jury.\n\nFor the reasons given we hold that the judgments below must be reversed, and the cases remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This section provides: \"If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 18 U.S.C. 1503 provides, in relevant part: \"Whoever corruptly . . . endeavors to influence, intimidate, or impede any witness, in any court of the United States or before any United States commissioner or other committing magistrate, or any grand or petit juror, or officer in or of any court of the United States . . . in the discharge of his duty . . . or corruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\" Grunewald and Bolich were acquitted on these Counts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Paragraph 7 of the indictment alleged: \"It was a part of the conspiracy that the defendants and co-conspirators would make continuing efforts to avoid detection and prosecution by any governmental body . . . of tax frauds perpetrated by the defendants and co-conspirators, through the use of any means whatsoever, including but not limited to, bribery, improper influence and corruption of government employees, the giving of false testimony, [etc.] . . . .\"\n\nParagraph 13 alleged: \"It was further a part of the conspiracy that the defendants and co-conspirators at all times would misrepresent, conceal and hide and cause to be misrepresented, concealed and hidden, the acts done pursuant to and the purposes of said conspiracy.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 233 F.2d, at 559-562.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] A \"no prosecution\" ruling is an internal decision by the investigative branch of the Bureau of Internal Revenue not to press criminal charges against a taxpayer.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The payments were made in cash. In order to raise the money and leave no traces, the taxpayers made unrecorded sales, the profits of which were again unreported income. Further large fees were paid to Halperin and his associates.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Petitioner Bolich was also convicted on Count 2 of the indictment, which charged him and two other Bureau of Internal Revenue employees with conspiracy in violation of 26 U.S.C. 4047 (e) (4). He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and a $5,000 fine on this Count, the prison sentence to run concurrently with the five-year sentence on Count 1. The Court of Appeals held that both Counts related to the same conspiracy, and set aside the separate fine on Count 2.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The governing statute was 18 U.S.C. 3282, which provided: \"Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, no person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment is found . . . within three years next after such offense shall have been committed.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] On September 1, 1954, the statute of limitations was amended to provide for a five-year limitation period. 68 Stat. 1145, 18 U.S.C. (Supp. III) 3282. Since the amending statute was by its terms made applicable to offenses not barred on its effective date, that is, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 397]\n\u00a0\n September 1, 1954, it would seem that in fact the crucial date here is September 1, 1951, rather than October 25; in other words, if the conspiracy was still alive after September 1, it was not barred. However, the case was tried on the theory that October 25 was the crucial date, and we so treat it in this opinion. The error, of course, was favorable to the petitioners and was therefore harmless. On the other hand, since we hold that petitioners must have a new trial, the error may be corrected.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See, in general, Lutwak v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 604\n; Krulewitch v.

Rev. 1216.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] In support of this theory, petitioners point to evidence showing that the administrative practice of the Bureau of Internal Revenue was that only recommendations to prosecute would be reviewed at a higher echelon, whereas a determination of no prosecution would, for all practical purposes, end the case. They also emphasize that payment to Grunewald was made under the terms of an escrow which released the money when the \"no prosecution\" rulings came down.\n\nPetitioners further urge that the acts of concealment occurring after 1949 show at most that a new and separate agreement to conceal was entered into after 1949, an agreement which was not charged in the indictment. Cf. United States v. Siebricht, 59 F.2d 976. In view of our disposition of the case, we need not deal with this contention.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] \n336 \nU.S., at 443\n-444.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Id., at 455-456.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See \n336 \nU.S., at 444\n, 455-458; \n344 \nU.S., at 616\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] One might cite as an example Grunewald's attempt at influencing his secretary not to talk to the grand jury, accompanied by an offer to \"pay her expenses.\" Under the Government's Krulewitch theory, the argument would have been (in Mr. Justice Jackson's words) that the \"law will impute to the confederates a continuing conspiracy to defeat justice,\" and that therefore the other confederates are \"bound by another's unauthorized and unknown . . . bribery of a juror or witness.\" But no different result is achieved by saying that the attempted bribe of the witness is evidence from which one can infer an \"actual\" conspiracy to \"defeat justice.\" In both cases the essential missing element is a showing that the act was done in furtherance of a prior criminal agreement among the conspirators.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Delli Paoli v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 232\n; Lutwak v. United States, supra; Krulewitch v. United States, supra; Bollenbach v. United States, \n326 \nU.S. 607\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] See Rettich v. United States, 84 F.2d 118; McDonald v. United States, 89 F.2d 128.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] The tax evasion cases were governed by a six-year statute of limitations, 26 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 3748, which began to run when the last return, pertaining to the year 1946, was filed by the taxpayers.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] The Government also suggests a further theory under which this conspiracy could be deemed to have lasted into the indictment period. Under this theory, the central aim of the conspiracy was not specifically to \"fix\" the tax troubles of Gotham and Patullo, but to engage in the continuing business of fixing any and all tax-fraud \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 407]\n\u00a0\n cases. If this were the aim of the conspiracy, acts of concealment could have been in furtherance of this aim by enabling the ring to stay in business so that it could get new cases. Evidence supporting this theory, says the Government, is that in 1950, after the \"no prosecution\" rulings in the Patullo and Gotham cases, Halperin engaged in negotiations with another firm which was in tax difficulties. Although these negotiations came to nothing, due to disagreement about the fee to be paid to the conspirators, the incident is presented as evidence that the conspirators were actively soliciting future tax clients in 1950 and were thus still \"in business.\"\n\nWe cannot accept this theory of the Government. The trouble is not only that the theory was never submitted to the jury, but that no overt act done to further the purpose of engaging in \"new\" business was charged or proved to have occurred after October 25, 1951. If one of the purposes of the conspiracy was to engage in the business of fixing tax cases generally, it must be deemed to have been abandoned in 1951, when investigations of the petitioners started in Congress, since the 1951 and 1952 activities of the conspirators consisted merely of covering up old ventures rather than seeking new ones, and since there is no indication that there was an intent to resume operations after the investigations had ended. Indeed, upon the oral argument the Government seemed to abandon this theory.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] The indictment was clearly sufficient to cover submission of this theory to the jury. See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] One might cite as a typical example an incident in the record occurring in November 1949, 10 months after the \"no prosecution\" ruling was handed down in the Patullo case. The Special Agent who had been working on the case wrote a final report on it, which stated that Patullo was not prosecuted solely because of Bolich's decision. This report was sent to Bolich, who thereupon called the Chief of the Conference Section and asked him to write an explanatory memorandum on the case so as to \"take a little heat off the situation.\" This attempt to \"doctor\" the report might easily have been motivated not only by fear for himself, but by a purpose to safeguard the \"no prosecution\" ruling from change in order to maintain the immunity of the taxpayers.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] The negotiations between Halperin and his associates and the taxpayers were never very specific as to what exactly was to be accomplished. The tenor of the discussions was that if the taxpayers would hire the mysterious \"influential\" man in Washington, the matter \"would be ended,\" the \"prosecution end of the case\" would be avoided, the matter would be settled \"in a civil way without criminal prosecution.\" In the same tenor, the accountant of Gotham Beef testified that \"nothing at all was to be paid unless the criminal prosecution had been eliminated. It was further understood that they were not at all concerned with the amount of the tax that might result by way of assessment, but it was either that they were completely successful in eliminating criminal prosecution . . . or there would be no fee at all.\" In other words, there is little indication that it was the specific and narrow end of obtaining the \"no prosecution\" rulings which was to be the quid pro quo.\n\nThis is further buttressed by the fact that the taxpayers were well aware of the precarious nature of the 1948 and 1949 rulings; it is quite clear that they realized that this did not \"end\" the danger of criminal prosecution. Thus the Patullo taxpayers were aware that the continued investigation of their books for the purposes of civil \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 410]\n\u00a0\n tax liability exposed them to constant danger of \"tipping the applecart.\" They were warned to \"keep their mouths shut,\" and a further payment of $25,000 was made for the \"boys in New York\" so that no one would \"raise a fuss about the phony deal that had been put through.\" Another Patullo officer testified that, after the \"no prosecution\" ruling, \"we still were not at ease about the thing. We knew that we were elated over the results, but we still were worried about it. There was cooperation to take care of. We had to make this payoff for the New York boys. We were not through with it at that time. We never knew when something else was going to come up. We weren't through at all. . . . For two years after that we still weren't through with the thing.\" And, referring to the payment for the \"New York boys\" in 1949: \"[W]e never felt too sure about anything because the civil settlement still had to be made and we knew there were people that had to go through it and pass on it and everything, and while this was going on we were told that we would have to get up some more money.\"\n\nA jury could thus easily infer that the conspirators' function did not end in January 1949, and that the conspiratorial agreement contemplated further efforts to immunize the taxpayers from tax prosecution.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] It should be mentioned that the Court of Appeals was unanimous in finding that there was sufficient evidence in the record to warrant the submission of the case to the jury on the theory that the central objectives of the conspiracy were not achieved until the statute of limitations ran on the tax-evasion charges. Judge Frank, while dissenting on the ground that the charge to the jury was inadequate in putting the case to the jury on this basis - a view which we share, see infra, p. 413 - agreed that under a proper charge the jury might infer that the conspiracy was still alive through 1951. See 233 F.2d, at 592-596.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] See n. 2, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] Grunewald and Bolich also make this contention on their own behalf.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] The questions were: (1) Whether petitioner held escrow money which was subsequently delivered to Grunewald; (2) whether petitioner knew Grunewald; (3) whether petitioner made a telephone call to Grunewald relative to an appointment between Bolich and one Davis, a member of the conspiracy; (4) whether petitioner had \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 417]\n\u00a0\n filed a power of attorney in the Glover case; (5) whether he had ever met one Oliphant, an official in the Treasury; (6) whether he knew Steinberg; (7) whether he knew Tobias, the accountant of Gotham Beef; (8) whether he had ever met Grunewald in the Munsey Building in Washington.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] The charge as to this point was as follows:\n\n\"During the cross examination of one of the defendants, the government questioned the defendant as to his previous statements before the Brooklyn Grand Jury in which he refused to answer certain questions on the ground that answers to them might tend to incriminate him. These questions related to matters similar to those to which the defendant testified at this trial when he took the stand. No witness is required to take the stand or required to give testimony that might tend to incriminate him; but when a defendant takes the stand in his own defense at a trial, it is proper to interrogate him as to previous statements which he may have made under oath concerning the same matter, including his assertion of his constitutional privilege to refuse to testify as to those matters before a grand jury. You may use this evidence of a defendant's prior assertions of the Fifth Amendment for the sole purpose of ascertaining the weight you choose to give to his present testimony with respect to the same matters upon which he previously invoked his privilege.\n\n\n\"The defendant had the right of asserting the Fifth Amendment when he appeared before the Grand Jury, and I charge you that you are not to draw any inference whatsoever as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case by reason of the fact that he chose to assert his unquestioned right to invoke the Fifth Amendment on that previous occasion. However, it was proper for the Government to question the defendant with respect to his previous invocation of the Fifth Amendment, but you may consider this evidence of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 418]\n\u00a0\n his prior assertions of the Fifth Amendment only for the purpose of ascertaining the weight you choose to give to his present testimony with respect to the same matters upon which he previously asserted his constitutional privilege. It is not to be considered in a determination of the guilt or innocence of any co-defendant.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] United States v. Gottfried, 165 F.2d 360, 367.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] When the trial court first ruled that the Government could cross-examine as to petitioner's Fifth Amendment plea, it did not do so on the grounds of inconsistency reflecting on credibility. In fact the implication to be drawn from the record is that the court at that time felt that the jury might use this evidence for any purpose at all, including the drawing of inferences as to guilt or innocence. When the Government first embarked on this method of cross-examination, the judge overruled objections in these words:\n\n\"The Court: I know the Government's position. As I see it, Mr. Corbin [a defense attorney], no witness can be compelled to testify against himself. The witness is called before the grand jury and the answer was, I refuse to answer something on the ground that if I answer that question it will incriminate me.\n\n\n\"Mr. Corbin: Tend to incriminate.\n\n\n\"The Court: Or tend to incriminate. A witness can make that statement. No witness has to take the witness stand, as I understand the law and if a witness has so stated, then he could not be compelled to take the stand here, but if a witness voluntarily takes the stand and is asked in a previous proceeding did you say any testimony on this subject would incriminate you, that can be considered by the jury for such benefit or such worth as the jury may want to give it.\"\n\n\n When the defendants asked that at the very least the use of this evidence be restricted to the question of credibility, the judge contented himself with asking for a memorandum of law on the subject. Thus, although later, in the charge to the jury, the matter was specifically restricted to the issue of credibility, there was no inquiry by the judge at the time of the initial admission of this evidence as to whether a sufficient showing of inconsistency had been made.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] The certified question was: \"Was it error to require the defendant, Raffel, offering himself as a witness upon the second trial, to disclose that he had not testified as a witness in his own behalf upon the first trial?\" \n271 \nU.S., at 496\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] In Raffel this Court assumed that the defendant's failure to testify at the first trial could not be used as evidence of guilt in the second trial, \n271 \nU.S., at 497\n. The Court further stated that \"the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 421]\n\u00a0\n trial judge might appropriately instruct the jury that the failure of the defendant to take the stand in his own behalf is not in itself to be taken as an admission of the truth of the testimony which he did not deny.\" As already indicated, p. 418, supra, here the trial judge refused to charge that \"an innocent man may honestly claim that his answers may tend to incriminate him.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 425]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, concurring.\n\nI concur in the reversal of these cases for the reasons given in the Court's opinion with one exception.\n\nIn No. 184, the petitioner, Halperin, appeared before a grand jury in response to a subpoena. There he declined to answer certain questions relying on the provision of the Fifth Amendment that \"No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\"\n\nLater, at his trial, Halperin took the stand to testify in his own behalf. On cross-examination the prosecuting attorney asked him the same questions that he had refused to answer before the grand jury. This time Halperin answered the questions; his answers tended to show that he was innocent of any wrong-doing. The Government was then permitted over objection to draw from him the fact that he had previously refused to answer these questions before the grand jury on the ground that his answers might tend to incriminate him.\n\nAt the conclusion of the trial the judge instructed the jury that Halperin's claim of his constitutional privilege not to be a witness against himself could be considered in determining what weight should be given to his testimony - in other words, whether Halperin was a truthful and trustworthy witness. I agree with the Court that use of this claim of constitutional privilege to reflect upon Halperin's credibility was error, but I do not, like the Court, rest my conclusion on the special circumstances of this case. I can think of no special circumstances that would justify use of a constitutional privilege to discredit or convict a person who asserts it. The value of constitutional privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on them. It seems peculiarly \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 426]\n\u00a0\n incongruous and indefensible for courts which exist and act only under the Constitution to draw inferences of lack of honesty from invocation of a privilege deemed worthy of enshrinement in the Constitution. To the extent that approval of such a rule in Raffel v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 494\n, has vitality after Johnson v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 189, 196\n-199, I think the Raffel case should be explicitly overruled. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 391, 427]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGUSS v.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented by this appeal and by No. 41, post, p. 20, and No. 50, post, p. 26, also decided this day, is whether Congress, by vesting in the National Labor \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Relations Board jurisdiction over labor relations matters affecting interstate commerce, has completely displaced state power to deal with such matters where the Board has declined or obviously would decline to exercise its jurisdiction but has not ceded jurisdiction pursuant to the proviso to 10 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act.\n1\n It is a question we left open in Building Trades Council v. Kinard Construction Co., \n346 \nU.S. 933\n.\n\nSome background is necessary for an understanding of this problem in federal-state relations and how it assumed its present importance. Since it was first enacted in 1935, the National Labor Relations Act\n2\n has empowered the National Labor Relations Board \"to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice . . . [defined by the Act] affecting commerce.\"\n3\n By this language and by the definition of \"affecting commerce\" elsewhere in the Act,\n4\n Congress meant to reach to the full extent of its power under the Commerce Clause. Labor Board v. Fainblatt, \n306 \nU.S. 601, 606\n-607. The Board, however, has never exercised the full measure of its jurisdiction. For a number of years, the Board decided case-by-case whether to take jurisdiction. In 1950, concluding that \"experience warrants the establishment and announcement of certain standards\" to govern the exercise of its jurisdiction, Hollow Tree Lumber Co., 91 N. L. R. B. 635, 636, the Board published standards, largely in terms \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n of yearly dollar amounts of interstate inflow and outflow.\n5\n In 1954, a sharply divided Board, see Breeding Transfer Co., 110 N. L. R. B. 493, revised the jurisdictional standards upward.\n6\n This Court has never passed and we do not pass today upon the validity of any particular declination of jurisdiction by the Board or any set of jurisdictional standards.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nHow many labor disputes the Board's 1954 standards leave in the \"twilight zone\" between exercised federal jurisdiction and unquestioned state jurisdiction is not known.\n8\n In any case, there has been recently a substantial volume of litigation raising the question stated at the beginning of this opinion, of which this case is an example.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nAppellant, doing business in Salt Lake City, Utah, manufactures specialized photographic equipment for the Air Force on a contract basis. To fulfill his government contracts he purchased materials from outside Utah in an amount \"a little less than $50,000.\" Finished products \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n were shipped to Air Force bases, one within Utah and the others outside. In 1953 the United Steelworkers of America filed with the National Labor Relations Board a petition for certification of that union as the bargaining representative of appellant's employees. A consent election was agreed to, the agreement reciting that appellant was \"engaged in commerce within the meaning of Section 2 (6), (7) of the National Labor Relations Act.\" The union won the election and was certified by the National Board as bargaining representative. Shortly thereafter the union filed with the National Board charges that appellant had engaged in unfair labor practices proscribed by 8 (a) (1), (3) and (5) of the Act.\n10\n Meanwhile, on July 15, 1954, the Board promulgated its revised jurisdictional standards. The Board's Acting Regional Director declined to issue a complaint. He wrote on July 21:\n\n \"Further proceedings are not warranted, inasmuch as the operations of the Company involved are predominantly local in character, and it does not appear that it would effectuate the policies of the Act to exercise jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n The union thereupon filed substantially the same charges with the Utah Labor Relations Board, pursuant to the Utah Labor Relations Act.\n11\n Appellant urged that the State Board was without jurisdiction of a matter within the jurisdiction of the National Board. The State Board, however, found it had jurisdiction and concluded on the merits that appellant had engaged in unfair labor practices as defined by the Utah Act. It granted relief through a remedial order. On a Writ of Review, the Utah Supreme Court affirmed the decision and order of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n the state administrative agency.\n12\n We noted probable jurisdiction. \n352 \nU.S. 817\n.\n\nOn these facts we start from the following uncontroverted premises:\n\n(1) Appellant's business affects commerce within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act and the National Labor Relations Board had jurisdiction. Labor Board v. Fainblatt, supra.\n\n(2) The National Act expressly deals with the conduct charged to appellant which was the basis of the state tribunals' actions. Therefore, if the National Board had not declined jurisdiction, state action would have been precluded by our decision in Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485\n.\n\n(3) The National Board has not entered into any cession agreement with the Utah Board pursuant to 10 (a) of the National Act.\n\nSection 10 (a) provides:\n\n \"The Board is empowered, as hereinafter provided,  to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair  labor practice (listed in section 8) affecting commerce.  This power shall not be affected by any other  means of adjustment or prevention that has been  or may be established by agreement, law, or otherwise:  Provided, That the Board is empowered by  agreement with any agency of any State or Territory  to cede to such agency jurisdiction over any cases in  any industry (other than mining, manufacturing,  communications, and transportation except where  predominantly local in character) even though such  cases may involve labor disputes affecting commerce,  unless the provision of the State or Territorial statute  applicable to the determination of such cases by such \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n  agency is inconsistent with the corresponding provision  of this Act or has received a construction  inconsistent therewith.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n The proviso to 10 (a), italicized in the quotation above, was one of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the National Labor Relations Act. Timing and a reference in one of the committee reports indicate that it was drafted in response to the decision of this Court in Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York Labor Board, \n330 \nU.S. 767\n.\n13\n In Bethlehem foremen in an enterprise affecting commerce petitioned the New York State Labor Relations Board for certification as a bargaining unit. At that time the National Board was declining, as a matter of policy, to certify bargaining units composed of foremen. The Court held that the federal policy against certifying foremen's units must prevail. However, it took occasion to discuss the efforts of the two boards to avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.\n\n \"The National and State Boards have made a commendable effort to avoid conflict in this overlapping state of the statutes. We find nothing in their negotiations, however, which affects either the construction of the federal statute or the question of constitutional power insofar as they are involved in this case, since the National Board made no concession or delegation of power to deal with this subject. The election of the National Board to decline jurisdiction in certain types of cases, for budgetary or other reasons presents a different problem which we do not now decide.\" Id., at 776. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Three Justices were led to concur specially, because, as it was stated for the three:\n\n\"I read . . . [the Court's opinion] to mean that it is beyond the power of the National Board to agree with State agencies enforcing laws like the Wagner Act to divide, with due regard to local interests, the domain over which Congress had given the National Board abstract discretion but which, practically, cannot be covered by it alone. If such cooperative agreements between State and National Boards are barred because the power which Congress has granted to the National Board ousted or superseded State authority, I am unable to see how State authority can revive because Congress has seen fit to put the Board on short rations.\" Id., at 779.\n\n\n Thus, if the opinion of the Court did not make manifest, the concurring opinion did, that after Bethlehem there was doubt whether a state board could act either after a formal cession by the National Board or upon a declination of jurisdiction \"for budgetary or other reasons.\" When we read 10 (a) against this background we find unconvincing the argument that Congress meant by the proviso only to meet the first problem, i. e., cession of jurisdiction over cases the National Board would otherwise handle.\n\nThe proviso is directed at least equally to the type of cases which the Board might decline \"for budgetary or other reasons\" to hear as to the type of cases it might wish to cede to the States for policy reasons - if, indeed, there is any difference between the two classes. Cases in mining, manufacturing, communications and transportation can be ceded only where the \"industry\" is \"predominantly local in character.\" In other industries, which Congress might have considered to be more or less typically local, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n it put no such limitation on the Board's power. The Senate Committee spelled the matter out:\n\n\"The proviso which has been added to this subsection [ 10 (a)] permits the National Board to allow State labor-relations boards to take final jurisdiction of cases in border-line industries (i. e., border line insofar as interstate commerce is concerned), provided the State statute conforms to national policy\".\n14\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Committee minority agreed as to the purpose of the proviso and agreed \"with the majority that it is desirable thus to clarify the relations between the National Labor Relations Board and the various agencies which States have set up to handle similar problems.\"\n15\n\u00a0\n\nWe hold that the proviso to 10 (a) is the exclusive means whereby States may be enabled to act concerning the matters which Congress has entrusted to the National Labor Relations Board. We find support for our holding in prior cases in this Court. In Amalgamated Assn. of Employees v. Wisconsin Board, \n340 \nU.S. 383, 397\n-398, the Court said:\n\n\"The legislative history of the 1947 Act refers to the decision of this Court in Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York Labor Board, \n330 \nU.S. 767\n (1947), and, in its handling of the problems presented by that case, Congress demonstrated that it knew how to cede jurisdiction to the states. Congress knew full well that its labor legislation `preempts the field that the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n act covers insofar as commerce within the meaning of the act is concerned' and demonstrated its ability to spell out with particularity those areas in which it desired state regulation to be operative.\" (Footnotes omitted.)\n\n\n In a footnote to the first sentence quoted above the Court cited 10 (a) and described its authorization to cede jurisdiction only where the state law is consistent with the national legislation as insuring \"that the national labor policy will not be thwarted even in the predominantly local enterprises to which the proviso applies.\" Id., n. 23. See also Algoma Plywood & Veneer Co. v. Wisconsin Board, \n336 \nU.S. 301, 313\n; California v. Zook, \n336 \nU.S. 725, 732\n.\n\nOur reading of 10 (a) forecloses the argument based upon such cases as Welch Co. v. New Hampshire, \n306 \nU.S. 79\n, and Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Larabee Flour Mills Co., \n211 \nU.S. 612\n, that \"where federal power has been delegated but lies dormant and unexercised,\" Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York Labor Board, supra, at 775, the States' power to act with respect to matters of local concern is not necessarily superseded. But in each case the question is one of congressional intent. Compare Welch Co. v. New Hampshire, supra, with Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 605\n. And here we find not only a general intent to pre-empt the field but also the proviso to 10 (a), with its inescapable implication of exclusiveness.\n\nWe are told by appellee that to deny the State jurisdiction here will create a vast no-man's-land, subject to regulation by no agency or court. We are told by appellant that to grant jurisdiction would produce confusion and conflicts with federal policy. Unfortunately, both may be right. We believe, however, that Congress has expressed \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n its judgment in favor of uniformity. Since Congress' power in the area of commerce among the States is plenary, its judgment must be respected whatever policy objections there may be to creation of a no-man's-land.\n\nCongress is free to change the situation at will. In 1954 the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare recognized the existence of a no-man's-land and proposed an amendment which would have empowered state courts and agencies to act upon the National Board's declination of jurisdiction.\n16\n The National Labor Relations Board can greatly reduce the area of the no-man's-land by reasserting its jurisdiction and, where States have brought their labor laws into conformity with federal policy, by ceding jurisdiction under 10 (a).\n17\n The testimony given by the Chairman of the Board before the Appropriations Committees shortly before the 1954 revisions of the jurisdictional standards indicates that its reasons for making that change were not basically \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n budgetary.

JUSTICE BURTON, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, dissenting.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nI believe the Court is mistaken in its interpretation of the proviso which Congress added to 10 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act in 1947.\n1\n It is my view that the proviso was added merely to make it clear that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n the National Labor Relations Board had the power, by making specific agreements, to cede jurisdiction to state or territorial agencies over certain labor disputes. Congress sought thereby to facilitate state cooperation in the supervision of labor practices affecting interstate commerce. The Court is not justified in interpreting this action as evidencing an unexpressed and sweeping termination of the States' pre-existing power to deal with labor matters over which the Board, for budgetary or other administrative reasons, has declined, or obviously would decline, to exercise its full jurisdiction.\n\nThe Labor Acts of 1935 and 1947 granted to the Board extensive jurisdiction over labor controversies affecting interstate commerce but neither Act required the Board to assert at all times the full measure of its jurisdiction. In each Act the first sentence of 10 (a) \"empowered,\" but did not direct, the Board to prevent unfair labor practices. Likewise, the first sentence of 10 (b) granted the \"power,\" instead of imposing the duty, to issue complaints upon receipt of appropriate charges.\n2\n The Board is not a court whose jurisdiction over violations of private rights must be exercised. It is an administrative agency whose function is to adjudicate public rights in a manner that will effectuate the policies of the Act. See Amalgamated Utility Workers v. Consolidated Edison Co., \n309 \nU.S. 261\n.\n\nFrom the beginning, budgetary limitations and other administrative considerations have prevented the Board \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n from exercising jurisdiction over all cases in which interstate commerce was affected. Congress knew this when, in 1947, it left unchanged the discretionary language of 10 and added the proviso to 10 (a). Congress has consistently refrained from appropriating funds sufficient to permit the Board to entertain all complaints within its jurisdiction. In recent years Congress has repeatedly recognized the Board's jurisdictional practice.\n3\n In Labor Board v. Denver Bldg. Council, \n341 \nU.S. 675, 684\n, this Court said that \"Even when the effect of activities on interstate commerce is sufficient to enable the Board to take jurisdiction of a complaint, the Board sometimes properly declines to do so, stating that the policies of the Act would not be effectuated by its assertion of jurisdiction in that case.\" Courts of Appeals have approved the Board's practice\n4\n and none of the parties to the instant cases question it.\n\nUnless restricted by the proviso added to 10 (a), there is little doubt that the States have the necessary power to act in labor controversies within their borders, even when interstate commerce is affected, provided the Federal Government has not occupied the field and the National Board has not taken jurisdiction. Where the Board has \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n declined, or obviously would decline, to take jurisdiction, then federal power lies \"dormant and unexercised.\" Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York Labor Board, \n330 \nU.S. 767, 775\n. Unless the proviso stands in their way, the States may then exercise jurisdiction since their action will not conflict with the Board's administration of the Act.\n5\n Substantive provisions of the Act may limit the action of the States. See United Mine Workers v. Arkansas Oak Flooring Co., \n351 \nU.S. 62, 75\n. But the States are not deprived of all power to act.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nBy this decision the Court restricts the power of the States to those labor disputes over which the National Board expressly cedes its jurisdiction to the appropriate state agencies. However, the proviso's requirements are so highly restrictive that not a single cession has been made under it.\n7\n The result of this decision is the creation \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n of an extensive no man's land within which no federal or state agency or court is empowered to deal with labor controversies. It is difficult to believe that Congress, sub silentio, intended to take such a step backward in the field of labor relations.\n\nThe immediate occasion that led to the enactment of the proviso throws light on its proper interpretation. That occasion was this Court's decision in the Bethlehem case, supra, where it was held that a State Board did not have jurisdiction to certify a union of foremen as a collective-bargaining agency because the National Board, by asserting general jurisdiction over foremen's unions, had occupied the field.\n8\n Although an agreement had been negotiated between the National Board and the State Board ceding jurisdiction over certain labor matters, this Court concluded that the agreement did not cede jurisdiction over foremen's unions. Three Justices decried certain overtones they found in the opinion of the Court to the effect that the National Board lacked authority to cede jurisdiction over predominantly local labor matters \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n by agreement with state agencies. It was to clarify the power of the National Board to make such a cession that the proviso was added to 10 (a).\n\nWhile the proviso thus evidenced a congressional purpose to encourage state action, there is no indication that it was intended to wipe out, by implication, the States' recognized power to act when the National Board declined to take jurisdiction. Neither the language of the proviso nor its legislative history discloses a conscious congressional intent to eliminate state authority when the National Board has declined to act. Unequivocal legislative history would be necessary to sustain a conclusion that Congress intended such a drastic result. In the Bethlehem case, supra, the Court did not question the authority of the States to act when the Board, for budgetary or other administrative reasons, declined to exercise its full jurisdiction. The Court expressly refrained from passing on that question\n9\n but three Justices said that they found in the opinion of the Court a \"suggestion that the National Board's declination of jurisdiction `in certain types of cases, for budgetary or other reasons' might leave room for the State in those situations . . . .\" \n330 \nU.S., at 778\n.\n\nAs a matter of fact, in 1947, nearly 40 States lacked labor agencies and comprehensive labor legislation.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n Obviously, those States were ineligible to take advantage of the proviso. It is hard to imagine that Congress meant to make the proviso the exclusive channel for state jurisdiction when so many States would be automatically excluded from using it. The full mission of the proviso was to supply the National Board with express authority to cede jurisdiction over labor disputes by agreement where, as a matter of deliberate judgment, it concluded that due regard for local interests made that course desirable. The Board's jurisdictional yardsticks always have reflected its need to distribute its limited resources so as best to effectuate the policies of the Act. The Board does not \"cede\" jurisdiction when it declines to exercise its full jurisdiction; it merely allows the States to exercise their pre-existing authority.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court's interpretation of the proviso is contrary to the established practice of the States and of the National Board, as well as to the considered position taken by the Board as amicus curiae. Congress has demonstrated a continuing and deep interest in providing governmental machinery for handling labor controversies. The creation by it of a large, unsupervised no man's land flies in the face of that policy. Due regard for our federal system suggests that all doubts on this score should be resolved in favor of a conclusion that would not leave the States \n\n[353 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n powerless when the federal agency declines to exercise its jurisdiction. As three Justices said in the Bethlehem case, supra:\n\n \"Since Congress can, if it chooses, entirely displace  the States to the full extent of the far-reaching Commerce  Clause, Congress needs no help from generous  judicial implications to achieve the supersession of  State authority. To construe federal legislation so  as not needlessly to forbid preexisting State authority  is to respect our federal system. Any indulgence in  construction should be in favor of the States, because  Congress can speak with drastic clarity whenever it  chooses to assure full federal authority, completely  displacing the States.\" \n330 \nU.S., at 780\n.\n\n\n I would sustain the jurisdiction of the respective States in these cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [NOTE: This dissenting opinion applies also to No. 41, Amalgamated Meat Cutters v.

Lefevre filed a brief for Oliva, as amicus curiae, urging reversal. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 81, 82]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn 1949, the petitioner, Gordon P. Haynes, became sick and unable to work while employed by the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company. At that time the company had in effect a comprehensive \"Plan for Employees' Pensions, Disability Benefits and Death Benefits.\" This plan had been in force since 1913 when it was adopted by Southern Bell and other companies in the American Telephone and Telegraph Company system. A written copy of the plan, which was prepared much like an insurance policy, was given every person upon his initial employment by the company. Among other things, the plan provided that Southern Bell \"undertakes in accordance with these Regulations, to provide for the payment of definite amounts to its employees when they are disabled by accident or sickness.\" Under the plan every employee was entitled, after two years' service with Southern Bell, to receive \"sickness disability benefits\" when he missed work because of illness. These payments began on the eighth calendar day of absence due to illness. The amount and duration of payments were set out with specificity and varied with the length of service. For example, employees who had worked for Southern Bell from two to five years were entitled to full pay for four weeks and one-half pay for nine additional weeks; employees who had been with the company for more than twenty-five years were entitled to full pay for fifty-two weeks. The company reserved the right to change or terminate the plan but agreed that no changes would be made which affected \"the rights of any employee, without his consent, to any benefit or pension to which he may have previously become entitled hereunder.\"\n\nUnder the plan petitioner was paid $2,100 in sickness disability benefits during 1949. Since he had been an employee of the company for more than twenty-five years \n\n[353 \nU.S. 81, 83]\n\u00a0\n this was the full equivalent of what he would have received had he been working. The Government collected $318.44 income tax on petitioner's sickness benefits. He brought this action for a refund contending that these receipts were not taxable because of 22 (b) (5) of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code which exempted from taxable income \"amounts received, through accident or health insurance . . . as compensation for personal injuries or sickness.\"\n1\n The District Court held that the payments received by petitioner on account of sickness were not taxable and directed a refund. The Court of Appeals reversed, accepting the Government's contention that Southern Bell's plan was not \"health insurance\" but a \"wage continuation plan.\" 233 F.2d 413. In Epmeier v. United States, 199 F.2d 508, the Seventh Circuit held that disability payments under a plan similar to Southern Bell's were not taxable. Because of this conflict we granted certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 820\n.\n\nThe crucial question is whether the Southern Bell plan should be treated as \"health insurance\" within the meaning of 22 (b) (5). Broadly speaking, health insurance is an undertaking by one person for reasons satisfactory to him to indemnify another for losses caused by illness. We believe that the Southern Bell disability plan comes within this meaning of health insurance.\n\nIf Southern Bell had purchased from a commercial insurance company health insurance that provided its employees with precisely the same kind of protection promised under its own plan, the Government concedes that the payments received by ailing employees from the commercial company would not have been taxable. Nevertheless it argues that Southern Bell's plan should not be treated as \"health insurance\" because the employees \n\n[353 \nU.S. 81, 84]\n\u00a0\n paid no fixed periodic premiums, there was no definite fund created to assure payment of the disability benefits, and the amount and duration of the benefits varied with the length of service.\n2\n We do not believe that these facts remove the plan from the general category of health insurance. The payment of premiums in a fixed amount at regular intervals is not a necessary element of insurance. Similarly there is no necessity for a definite fund set aside to meet the insurer's obligations. And the fact that the amount and duration of benefits increased with the length of time that an employee worked for Southern Bell reflected the added value to the company of extra years of experience and service. Apparently the Government relies on these facts primarily to show that Southern Bell's plan did not contain features which would be present in the normal commercial insurance contract. The Government, however, offers no persuasive reason why the term \"health insurance\" in 22 (b) (5) should be limited to the particular forms of insurance conventionally made available by commercial companies. Certainly there is nothing in the language of 22 (b) (5) which compels this limitation.\n\nThere is no support in the legislative history for the Government's argument that Congress intended to restrict the exemption provided in 22 (b) (5) to \"conventional modes of insurance\" and not to include employer disability plans. For reasons deemed satisfactory, Congress, since 1918, has chosen not to tax receipts from health and accident insurance contracts.\n3\n The language \n\n[353 \nU.S. 81, 85]\n\u00a0\n of 22 (b) (5) appeared in the Revenue Act of 1918 and has reappeared without relevant change in all succeeding revenue acts up to 1954.\n4\n The term \"health insurance\" was not defined in any of these acts or in any of the committee reports. There has been no uniform administrative practice which can be drawn upon to support the narrow meaning of 22 (b) (5) now urged by the Government. Administrative rulings since 1918 appear to have regularly vacillated between holding receipts under company disability plans taxable and holding that they are not taxable.\n5\n Under these circumstances we see no reason why the term \"health insurance\" in 22 (b) (5) should not be given its broad general meaning.

United States, 199 F.2d 508, 511, the Seventh Circuit was of the opinion that: \"The provisions of Section 22 (b) (5) \n\n[353 \nU.S. 81, 85]\n\u00a0\n undoubtedly were intended to relieve a taxpayer who has the misfortune to become ill or injured, of the necessity of paying income tax upon insurance benefits received to combat the ravages of disease or accident.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Section 22 (b) (5) can be traced to 213 (b) (6) of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1066. In 104, 105 and 106 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. (Supp. III) 104-106, Congress again exempted amounts received through health insurance. However these new provisions limited the exclusion for receipts similar to those involved here to a maximum of $100 per week. We do not accept the Government's contention that the enactment of 104-106 shows that Congress in 1918, and in succeeding revenue measures, intended to distinguish between conventional commercial insurance and an employer's plan like that of Southern Bell's.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] T.

The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that there was a complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusion of negligence. This Court granted certiorari.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn this Federal Employers' Liability Act\n1\n case, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which was entered on a directed verdict in favor of the respondent. The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that there was a complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusion of negligence.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 518, 519]\n\u00a0\n This Court granted certiorari to determine whether the petitioner was erroneously deprived of a jury determination of his case.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe petitioner was the conductor in charge of a 67-car freight train which on February 1, 1951, was en route from Richmond, Indiana, to Columbus, Ohio. He was in the caboose at the end of the train when it came to a sudden stop about three miles before a scheduled stop in Dayton, Ohio. He brought this action for damages for injuries allegedly suffered from a fall in the caboose which occurred when the train stopped. He testified: \"Well, we were coming through there at a slow like speed and I don't know what went wrong, the train went in emergency and threw me into this table and tore it up and I was up on the floor with my flagman on top of me, when we finally got straightened up.\" He immediately left the caboose and satisfied himself that the stop was not caused by a mechanical failure of the braking equipment, but rather that the engineer had applied the brakes to bring the train to a stop. At the end of the run, he filed his routine conductor's report of the incident. He read that report into the record, without objection, during his cross-examination. The report states: \"CN 28, Engine 8800 and 5680 moving east through Dayton, with 67 cars, at estimated speed of eight or ten miles per hour. Automobile drove over crossing just east of Dayton Rubber Works. To prevent striking automobile engineman applied air in emergency causing rough stop. I was standing in cabin observing air gauge and when stop was made knocked me to floor of cabin bruising my hip.\" He also stated that the engineer had told him that there were school children in the automobile. There was no evidence that the stop was made with any special or unusual severity. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 518, 520]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe sole issue raised is whether a jury question was presented by the evidence under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. We agree with the lower courts that a jury question of negligence was not presented by the proofs. The proofs do not meet the tests laid down by this Court in Jesionowski v. Boston & M. R. Co., \n329 \nU.S. 452\n. The employee's injuries in the Jesionowski case resulted from a derailment. This Court held that derailments are \"extraordinary, not usual, happenings,\" so that when they occur \"a jury may fairly find that they occurred as a result of negligence.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIn this case, there is no evidence to show that unscheduled and sudden stops of trains are unusual or extraordinary occurrences. In fact, the only evidence was petitioner's testimony that they are not unusual or extraordinary. He testified: \"We got to expect them or think about them.\" The facts of this occurrence thus do not warrant the inference that the respondent was negligent.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n [For dissenting opinion of MR.

SHAUGHNESSY(1957)\nNo. 205\nArgued: March 4, 1957Decided: March 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioners, husband and wife, entered the United States in 1951 as alien seamen, and remained unlawfully after expiration of their limited lawful stay. In November 1951 a child was born to them - an American citizen by birth. In January 1952 petitioners applied for suspension of deportation under 19 (c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, which conditionally authorizes suspension of a deportation which \"would result in serious economic detriment to a citizen . . . who is the . . . minor child of such deportable alien.\" The Board of Immigration Appeals found that petitioners were eligible for relief but, as a matter of administrative discretion, denied suspension of deportation, relying mainly on the fact that petitioners had established no roots or ties in this country.

Roberts argued the cause for respondent. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, John F. Davis and Isabelle Cappello.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a habeas corpus proceeding to test the validity of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals denying petitioners' request for suspension of deportation.\n\nPetitioners are husband and wife, both aliens. Prior to 1951 both worked as seamen on foreign vessels. In July 1951 the wife lawfully entered the United States as a crew member of a ship in a United States port. Being pregnant, she sought medical advice; subsequently she decided in the interest of her health to stay ashore. A month later, on the next occasion his ship arrived in the United States, her husband joined her; he also failed to leave on the expiration of his limited lawful stay.\n1\n In November 1951 their child was born; the child is, of course, an American citizen by birth. In January 1952 petitioners voluntarily disclosed their illegal presence to the Immigration Service and applied for suspension of deportation under 19 (c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, which provides, in part:\n\n\"In the case of any alien . . . who is deportable under any law of the United States and who has proved good moral character for the preceding five years, the Attorney General may . . . suspend \n\n[353 \nU.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n deportation of such alien if he is not ineligible for naturalization . . . if he finds (a) that such deportation would result in serious economic detriment to a citizen or legally resident alien who is the spouse, parent, or minor child of such deportable alien . . . .\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n Deportation proceedings were instituted in May 1952 and a hearing was held. On the undisputed facts both aliens were found deportable. As to the issue of suspension of deportation, the Hearing Officer, while finding petitioners eligible for such relief, denied the request, stating as follows:\n\n  \"Both respondents have applied for suspension of  deportation on the ground of the economic detriment  that would befall their minor son in the event they  were deported. . . . Both disclaim having a criminal  record anywhere and both allege that they have  been persons of good moral character. Evidence of  record would tend to corroborate their testimony in  this respect. Their only income is from the employment  of the male respondent on two jobs . . . .  Their joint assets consist of savings in the sum of  about $500 and their furniture and other personal  property which they value at $1500. While it would  seem that their son . . . would suffer economically if  his parents should be deported, it is not believed that  as a matter of administrative discretion the respondents'  applications for suspension of deportation  should be granted. They have been in the United  States for a period of less than one year. They have  no relatives in this country other than each other and  their son. To grant both this form of relief upon the  accident of birth in the United States of their son \n\n[353 \nU.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n  would be to deprive others, who are patiently awaiting  visas under their already oversubscribed quotas.  It is noted also that neither respondent reported his  and her presence in the United States at any time  until January, 1952 when they filed applications for  suspension of deportation just two months after the  birth of their child. . . .\"\n\n\n The Board of Immigration Appeals heard petitioners' appeal, and on March 18, 1954, upheld the Hearing Officer's recommendation and denied suspension of deportation. The Board stated:\n\n \"It is obvious that the American citizen infant child  is dependent upon the alien parents for economic  support, care and maintenance. Documentary and  other evidence establish good moral character for the  requisite period. The aliens have no connection  with subversive groups.\n\n\n .  . .  .  .\n\n\n  \"As stated above, we have, in the instant case, a  family consisting of two alien parents illegally residing  in the United States and one American citizen  child, age about two and one-half years. These  respondents have been in the United States for a  period of less than three years. Both arrived in this  country as seamen. They have no other dependents  or close family ties here. The record indicates that  the male respondent may be able to obtain work as  a Greek seaman and earn about $85 monthly.\n\n\n  \"Notwithstanding the fact that . . . the deportation  of these respondents would result in a serious  economic detriment to an American citizen infant  child, the granting or withholding of maximum discretionary  relief depends on the factors and merits  in each individual case, and is a matter of administrative \n\n[353 \nU.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n  discretion. We have carefully examined the  facts and circumstances in the instant case and we  find that the granting of the maximum relief is not  warranted by the record in the case. . . .\"\n\n\n Petitioners thereupon moved for reconsideration. On May 5, 1954, the Board denied the motion, stating:\n\n \"Counsel's motion sets forth no matters of which we were unaware at the time our previous decision was rendered. It is crystal clear that Congress intended to greatly restrict the granting of suspension of deportation by the change of phraseology which was used in Section 244 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [of 1952] as well as the Congressional comment at the time this provision was enacted.\n3\n We indicated in our previous order that the deportation of the respondents would result in \n\n[353 \nU.S. 72, 77]\n\u00a0\n a serious economic detriment to their citizen minor child, and we do not question that the respondents have established the statutory requirements for suspension of deportation . . . .\n\n\n  . .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Upon our further review of the cases of the two respondents, we adhere to our previous decision that suspension of deportation should be denied as a matter of administrative discretion . . . .\"\n\n\n Taken into custody for deportation, petitioners instituted the present habeas corpus proceeding, alleging that the Board abused its discretion in denying their application for suspension of deportation. The District Court dismissed the writ, 133 F. Supp. 433, and the Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, affirmed, 233 F.2d 705. We granted certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 819\n.\n\nWe do not think that there was error in these proceedings. It is clear from the record that the Board applied the correct legal standards in deciding whether petitioners met the statutory prerequisites for suspension of deportation. The Board found that petitioners met these standards and were eligible for relief. But the statute does not contemplate that all aliens who meet the minimum legal standards will be granted suspension. Suspension of deportation is a matter of discretion and of administrative grace, not mere eligibility; discretion must be exercised even though statutory prerequisites have been met.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nNor can we say that it was abuse of discretion to withhold relief in this case. The reasons relied on by the Hearing Officer and the Board - mainly the fact that petitioners had established no roots or ties in this country - were neither capricious nor arbitrary. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 72, 78]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioners urge that the Board applied an improper standard in exercising its discretion when, in its opinion on rehearing, it took into account the congressional policy underlying the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the latter being concededly inapplicable to this case. We cannot agree with this contention. The second opinion makes clear that the Board still considered petitioners eligible for suspension under the 1917 Act\n5\n and denied relief solely as a matter of discretion. And we cannot say that it was improper or arbitrary for the Board to be influenced, in exercising that discretion, by its views as to congressional policy as manifested by the 1952 Act. Section 19 (c) does not state what standards are to guide the Attorney General in the exercise of his discretion. Surely it is not unreasonable for him to take cognizance of present-day conditions and congressional attitudes, any more than it would be arbitrary for a judge, in sentencing a criminal, to refuse to suspend sentence because contemporary opinion, as exemplified in recent statutes, has increased in rigour as to the offense involved. This conclusion is fortified by the fact that 19 (c) provides for close congressional supervision over suspensions of deportation. In every case where suspension for more than six months is granted a report must be submitted to Congress, and if thereafter Congress does not pass a concurrent resolution approving the suspension of deportation, the alien must then be deported.\n6\n In other words, every such \n\n[353 \nU.S. 72, 79]\n\u00a0\n suspension must be approved by Congress, and yet petitioners would have us hold that the Attorney General may not take into account the current policies of Congress in exercising his discretion. This we cannot do.\n\nThere being no error, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Under certain conditions alien crewmen are permitted to enter the United States for periods not exceeding 29 days.

Hardship or even unusual hardship to the alien or to his spouse, parent, or child is not sufficient to justify suspension of deportation. . . .\" S. Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 25.

See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The statute provides: \"If the deportation of any alien is suspended under the provisions of this subsection for more than six months, a complete and detailed statement of the facts and pertinent provisions of law in the case shall be reported to the Congress with the reasons for such suspension.

(1946 ed., Supp. V) 155 (c).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\nThis case, on its face, seems to be an instance of a deportation which would \"result in serious economic detriment to a citizen,\" as those words are used in 19 (c) of the Immigration Act of 1917.\n\nThe citizen is a five-year-old boy who was born here and who, therefore, is entitled to all the rights, privileges, and immunities which the Fourteenth Amendment bestows on every citizen. A five-year-old boy cannot enjoy the educational, spiritual, and economic benefits which our society affords unless he is with his parents. His parents are law-abiding and self-supporting. From this record it appears that they are good members of the community. They do not seem to have done anything illegal or antisocial that should penalize their American son. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 72, 80]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that the maintenance of this young American citizen in a home in America is the way to effectuate the policy of the 1917 Act.\n\nThe Board did not treat the case that way. Instead it imported into the 1917 Act the standard prescribed by the 1952 Act, which concededly is inapplicable here. That was the error which led Judge Frank to dissent below. 233 F.2d 705, 709, 710. I think Judge Frank was right. Prevailing congressional policy on the approval or disapproval of suspension orders in nowise affects the standards prescribed for administrative action under the 1917 Act.\n\nThe Board erroneously followed irrelevant standards instead of exercising its discretion under the applicable statute, viz. 19 (c) of the 1917 Act. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 72, 81]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOBART v.

Upon protest against the New York and Philadelphia schedules by Baltimore civic and commercial interests and railroads serving that port, the Interstate Commerce Commission instituted an investigation as a result of which Division 2 of the Commission filed a report approving the tariff schedules giving Philadelphia parity with Baltimore but finding all other schedules that had been issued in this series of reductions to be not just and reasonable. 291 I. C. C. 527. On petition of various parties, the Commission reopened the proceedings, and on October 1, 1956, the full Commission modified the findings of the Division 2 report to the extent of finding the New York schedules, as well as the Philadelphia schedules, to be just and reasonable, 299 I. C. C. 195. The full Commission's order was challenged in a proceeding instituted under 28 U.S.C. 1336, and an appropriate District Court held that the Commission's approval of parity between New York and Baltimore was without basis in the record and ordered that portion of the Commission's order vacated. The court further held that the Commission's approval of parity between Philadelphia and Baltimore was not supported by essential findings as to ocean freight costs and anticipated traffic and remanded that portion of the Commission's order for more explicit findings. The court also granted other relief subsidiary to these actions. 151 F. Supp. 258. These are the only portions of the decision below with which we are here concerned. We put to one side those provisions of the decree below in which the District Court affirmed other portions of the Commission's order. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 175, 178]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrom what appears, it is not precluded that the Commission may find an interrelationship, within the purview of the National Transportation Policy, supra, among lawful tariffs to be established between these three ports and the \"differential territory.\" In this light we deem it appropriate that, in reconsidering the relationship between the Philadelphia and Baltimore schedules pursuant to the remand of the District Court, the Commission should be free to reconsider and take action upon the New York schedules. In carrying out the District Court's direction regarding the Philadelphia rates, the Commission should be permitted to take into account the effect of New York rates on the tariff relationship between Philadelphia and Baltimore and the effect of that relationship on New York and to enter such orders with respect to all three ports as the Commission may find to be required by their interrelationship. Accordingly, on the appeals before us, so much of the decree of the District Court as did not affirm the order of the Commission is vacated, and the cause is remanded for appropriate disposition not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK would affirm the judgment of the District Court. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 175, 179]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE GROBAN(1957)\nNo. 14\nArgued: November 6, 1956Decided: February 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n After a fire occurred on premises of a corporation owned and operated by appellants in Ohio, the State Fire Marshal subpoenaed appellants to appear as witnesses in an investigation by him of the cause of the fire. Relying on Page's Ohio Rev. Code, 1954, 3737.13, which provides that such an investigation \"may be private\" and that the Marshal may \"exclude from the place\" where the investigation is held \"all persons other than those required to be present,\" he refused to permit appellants' counsel to be present at the proceeding. Appellants declined to be sworn and to testify in the absence of their counsel. This was treated as a violation of 3737.12, which forbids any witness to refuse to be sworn or to refuse to testify; and, pursuant to 3737.99 (A), the Marshal committed appellants to jail until such time as they should be willing to testify. Denial of their application for a writ of habeas corpus was affirmed by the State Supreme Court. Held:\n\n 1. Under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2), this Court has jurisdiction of this appeal. Pp. 331-332.\n\n\n 2. Appellants had no constitutional right to be assisted by counsel in giving testimony at the investigatory proceeding conducted by the Fire Marshal; and, insofar as it authorizes the exclusion of counsel while a witness testifies, 3737.13 is not repugnant to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 332-335.\n\n\n 164 Ohio St. 26, 128 N. E. 2d 106, affirmed.\n\nJames F. Graham and Ernest B. Graham argued the cause and filed a brief for appellants.\n\nEarl W. Allison and J. Ralston Werum argued the cause and filed a brief for appellee.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented by this appeal is whether appellants had a constitutional right under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 331]\n\u00a0\n assistance of their own counsel in giving testimony as witnesses at a proceeding conducted by the Ohio State Fire Marshal to investigate the causes of a fire.\n\nAfter a fire occurred on the premises of a corporation owned and operated by appellants, the Fire Marshal started an investigation into the causes of the fire and subpoenaed appellants to appear as witnesses. The Fire Marshal refused to permit appellants' counsel to be present at the proceeding, relying on 3737.13 of the Ohio Code, which provides that the \"investigation may be private\" and that he may \"exclude from the place where [the] investigation is held all persons other than those required to be present . . . .\"\n1\n Appellants declined to be sworn and to testify without the immediate presence of their counsel, who had accompanied them to the hearing. Their refusal was treated as a violation of 3737.12, which provides that \"No witness shall refuse to be sworn or refuse to testify . . . .\" Section 3737.99 (A) provides that \"Whoever violates section 3737.12 . . . may be summarily punished, by the officer concerned, by . . . commitment to the county jail until such person is willing to comply with the order of such officer.\" The Fire Marshal accordingly committed appellants to the county jail until such time as they should be willing to testify.\n2\n Appellants' application for a writ of habeas corpus was denied by the Ohio Court of Common Pleas, and this denial was affirmed on appeal by the Ohio Court of Appeals and by the Ohio Supreme Court.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nWe postponed further consideration of the question of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. \n351 \nU.S. 903\n. The Ohio Supreme Court construed 3737.13 to \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 332]\n\u00a0\n authorize the Fire Marshal to exclude appellants' counsel from the proceeding. Since appellants' attack is on the constitutionality of that section, we have jurisdiction on appeal. 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2).\n\nWe note at the outset that appellants explicitly disavow making any direct attack on the Fire Marshal's power of summary punishment under 3737.99 (A). They challenge not the validity of the procedure by which they were committed to jail, but the constitutional sufficiency of the grounds on which they were so committed. Their sole assertion is that the Fire Marshal's authority to exclude counsel under 3737.13 was unconstitutional because they had a right, under the Due Process Clause, to the assistance of their counsel in giving their testimony.\n\nIt is clear that a defendant in a state criminal trial has an unqualified right, under the Due Process Clause, to be heard through his own counsel. Chandler v. Fretag, \n348 \nU.S. 3\n. Prosecution of an individual differs widely from administrative investigation of incidents damaging to the economy or dangerous to the public. The proceeding before the Fire Marshal was not a criminal trial, nor was it an administrative proceeding that would in any way adjudicate appellants' responsibilities for the fire. It was a proceeding solely to elicit facts relating to the causes and circumstances of the fire. The Fire Marshal's duty was to \"determine whether the fire was the result of carelessness or design,\" and to arrest any person against whom there was sufficient evidence on which to base a charge of arson.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe fact that appellants were under a legal duty to speak and that their testimony might provide a basis for criminal charges against them does not mean that they had a constitutional right to the assistance of their counsel. Appellants here are witnesses from whom information \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 333]\n\u00a0\n was sought as to the cause of the fire. A witness before a grand jury cannot insist, as a matter of constitutional right, on being represented by his counsel,\n5\n nor can a witness before other investigatory bodies.\n6\n There is no more reason to allow the presence of counsel before a Fire Marshal trying in the public interest to determine the cause of a fire. Obviously in these situations evidence obtained may possibly lay a witness open to criminal charges. When such charges are made in a criminal proceeding, he then may demand the presence of his counsel for his defense. Until then his protection is the privilege against self-incrimination.\n7\n U.S. Const., Amend V; Ohio Const., Art. I, 10. See Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46, 52\n. This is a privilege available in investigations as well as in prosecutions. See In re Groban, 164 Ohio St. 26, 28, 128 N. E. 2d 106, 108, and 99 Ohio App. 512, 515, 135 N. E. 2d 477, 479-480; McCarthy v. Arndstein, \n266 \nU.S. 34, 40\n; Adams v. Maryland, \n347 \nU.S. 179\n. We have no doubt that the privilege is available in Ohio against prosecutions as well as convictions reasonably feared. Cf. Ullmann v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 422, 431\n. The mere fact that suspicion may be entertained of such a witness, as appellants believed existed here, though without allegation of facts to support such a belief, does not bar the taking of testimony in a private investigatory proceeding.\n\nIt may be that the number of people present in a grand jury proceeding gives greater assurance that improper \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 334]\n\u00a0\n use will not be made of the witness' presence. We think, however, that the presumption of fair and orderly conduct by the state officials without coercion or distortion exists until challenged by facts to the contrary. Possibility of improper exercise of opportunity to examine is not in our judgment a sound reason to set aside a State's procedure for fire prevention. As in similar situations, abuses may be corrected as they arise, for example, by excluding from subsequent prosecutions evidence improperly obtained.\n\nOhio, like many other States, maintains a division of the state government directed by the Fire Marshal for the prevention of fires and reduction of fire losses.\n8\n Section 3737.13, which has been in effect since 1900,\n9\n represents a determination by the Ohio Legislature that investigations conducted in private may be the most effective method of bringing to light facts concerning the origins of fires, and, in the long run, of reducing injuries and losses from fires caused by negligence or by design. We cannot say that this determination is unreasonable. The presence of advisors to witnesses might easily so far encumber an investigatory proceeding as to make it unworkable or unwieldy. And with so weighty a public interest as fire prevention to protect, we cannot hold that the balance has been set in such a way as to be contrary to \"fundamental principles of liberty and justice.\" Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n. That is the test to measure the validity of a state statute under the Due Process Clause.\n\nAppellants urge, however, that the Fire Marshal's power to exclude counsel under 3737.13 must be considered in the light of his power of summary punishment \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 335]\n\u00a0\n under 3737.99 (A), and they would have us hold that, so considered, his power to exclude counsel was unconstitutional. We held in In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257\n, that a witness before a one-man grand jury, a judge, could not constitutionally be punished summarily for contempt of the grand jury without being allowed to be represented by his counsel. We see no relation between the premise that appellants could not be punished without representation by counsel and the conclusion that they could not be questioned without such representation. Section 3737.13 may contain a constitutional flaw if it should be construed to authorize the exclusion of counsel while the Fire Marshal determines that a witness has violated 3737.12 and orders the witness committed. The sole assertion of a constitutional violation that appellants relied upon before the Ohio Supreme Court and the only one open on the record here - the authorization in 3737.13 of the exclusion of counsel while a witness testifies - is not well founded. We hold that appellants had no constitutional right to be assisted by their counsel in giving testimony at the investigatory proceeding conducted by the Fire Marshal, and that 3737.13, insofar as it authorizes the exclusion of counsel while a witness testifies, is not repugnant to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Page's Ohio Rev.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, concurring.\n\nTo whatever extent history may confirm Lord Action's dictum that power tends to corrupt, such a doctrine of fear can hardly serve as a test, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, of a particular exercise of a State's legislative power. And so, the constitutionality of a particular statute, expressive of a State's view of desirable policy for dealing with one of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 336]\n\u00a0\n the rudimentary concerns of society - the prevention of fires and the ascertainment of their causes - and directed towards a particular situation, cannot be determined by deriving a troupe of hobgoblins from the assumption that such a particularized exercise of power would justify an unlimited, abusive exercise of power.\n\nIf the Ohio legislation were directed explicitly or by obvious design toward secret inquisition of those suspected of arson, we would have a wholly different situation from the one before us. This is not a statute directed to the examination of suspects. It is a statute authorizing inquiry by the chief guardian of a community against the hazards of fire into the causes of fires. To be sure, it does not preclude the possibility that a suspect might turn up among those to be questioned by the Fire Marshal. But the aim of the statute is the expeditious and expert ascertainment of the causes of fire. The Fire Marshal is not a prosecutor, though he may, like others, serve as a witness for the prosecution. In various proceedings, as for instance under some workmen's compensation laws, the presence of lawyers is deemed not conducive to the economical and thorough ascertainment of the facts. The utmost devotion to one's profession and the fullest recognition of the great role of lawyers in the evolution of a free society cannot lead one to erect as a constitutional principle that no administrative inquiry can be had in camera unless a lawyer be allowed to attend.\n\nThe assumption that as a normal matter such an inquiry carries with it deprivation of some rights of a citizen assumes inevitable misuse of authority. For good reasons, and certainly for constitutional purposes, the contrary assumption must be entertained. The potential danger most feared is that it will invade the privilege against self-incrimination in States where it is constitutionally recognized. But that privilege is amply safeguarded by the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio in this case. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 337]\n\u00a0\n We are not justified in invalidating this Ohio statute on the assumption that people called before the Fire Marshal would not be aware of their privilege not to respond to questions the answers to which may tend to incriminate. At a time when this privilege has attained the familiarity of the comic strips, the assumption of ignorance about the privilege by witnesses called before the Fire Marshal is too far-fetched an assumption on which to invalidate legislation.\n\nWhat has been said disposes of the suggestion that, because this statute relating to a general administrative, non-prosecutorial inquiry into the causes of fire is sustained, it would follow that secret inquisitorial powers given to a District Attorney would also have to be sustained. The Due Process Clause does not disregard vital differences. If it be said that these are all differences of degree, the decisive answer is that recognition of differences of degree is inherent in due regard for due process. We are admonished from time to time not to adjudicate on the basis of fear of foreign totalitarianism. Equally so should we not be guided in the exercise of our reviewing power over legislation by fear of totalitarianism in our own country.\n\nFor these reasons I join the opinion of the Court.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, dissenting.\n\nI believe that it violates the protections guaranteed every person by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for a state to compel a person to appear alone before any law-enforcement officer and give testimony in secret against his will. Under the reasoning of the majority every state and federal law-enforcement officer in this country could constitutionally be given power to conduct such secret compulsory examinations. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 338]\n\u00a0\n This would be a complete departure from our traditional methods of law enforcement and would go a long way toward placing \"the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.\"\n1\n By sanctioning the Ohio statutes involved here the majority disregards \"this nation's historic distrust of secret proceedings\"\n2\n and decides contrary to the general principle laid down by this Court in one of its landmark decisions that an accused \". . . requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Ohio statutes give the state Fire Marshal and his deputies broad power to investigate the cause of fires. These officers can summon any person to appear before one or more of them to testify under oath.\n4\n They can punish him summarily for contempt if he refuses to answer their questions or if he disobeys any of their orders.\n5\n They can exclude any person they wish from the examination, including the witness' counsel.\n6\n After the questioning the Marshal or his deputy can arrest the witness if he believes that there is evidence sufficient to charge him with arson or a similar crime.\n7\n Any statements taken from the suspect during these secret sessions must be turned over to the Prosecuting Attorney for use in any subsequent prosecution.\n8\n An \"Arson Bureau\" is established in the Fire Marshal's office and it is provided with \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 339]\n\u00a0\n a staff charged with the duty of investigating fires to determine if a crime has been committed. The Fire Marshal and his deputy in charge of the \"Arson Bureau\" are expressly made \". . . responsible . . . for the prosecution of persons believed to be guilty of arson or a similar crime.\"\n9\n The statutory provisions show that the Fire Marshal and his deputies are given the ordinary duties of policemen with respect to \"arson and similar crimes.\"\n\nAfter appellants' place of business at Dresden, Ohio, burned down, a deputy fire marshal summoned appellants to appear before him with their business records to answer questions about the fire. According to their unchallenged affidavit, the Fire Marshal believed that they had started the fire. Appellants appeared before the deputy with their lawyer, stating that they were willing to testify fully but only if they could have their counsel present during the interrogation. The deputy informed them that the interrogation would be held in private and refused to admit their lawyer. Under these conditions they refused to testify. The deputy proceeded to hold them in contempt and ordered them imprisoned until they were willing to testify before him in secret. Appellants' counsel was not present at the time they refused to testify nor when they were adjudged in contempt and ordered imprisoned.\n\nAppellants instituted this action for a writ of habeas corpus in a state court of Ohio contending that their imprisonment would be contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. The Ohio Supreme Court rejected this contention and affirmed the judgments of lower state courts refusing to issue the writ. This Court upholds the decision below, but even on the narrow grounds upon which it chooses to decide the case I think that its holding \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 340]\n\u00a0\n is erroneous and constitutes a very dangerous precedent.\n10\n I believe that the judgments below should be reversed because it is contrary to due process of law to imprison appellants for refusing to testify before the Deputy Fire Marshal in secret.\n\nA secret examination such as the deputy proposed to conduct is fraught with dangers of the highest degree to a witness who may be prosecuted on charges related to or resulting from his interrogation. Under the law of Ohio it seems clear that any statement allegedly secured from the witness may be used as evidence against him at a preliminary examination to justify his detention, before a grand jury to secure his indictment, and at the formal trial to obtain his conviction.\n11\n The witness has no effective way to challenge his interrogator's testimony as to what was said and done at the secret inquisition. The officer's version frequently may reflect an inaccurate understanding of an accused's statements or, on occasion, may be deliberately distorted or falsified. While the accused may protest against these misrepresentations, his protestations will normally be in vain. This is particularly true when the officer is accompanied by several of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 341]\n\u00a0\n his assistants and they all vouch for his story.\n12\n But when the public, or even the suspect's counsel, is present the hazards to the suspect from the officer's misunderstanding or twisting of his statements or conduct are greatly reduced.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThe presence of legal counsel or any person who is not an executive officer bent on enforcing the law provides still another protection to the witness. Behind closed doors he can be coerced, tricked or confused by officers into making statements which may be untrue or may hide the truth by creating misleading impressions. While the witness is in the custody of the interrogators, as \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 342]\n\u00a0\n a practical matter, he is subject to their uncontrolled will. Here it should be pointed out that the Ohio law places no restrictions on where the interrogations can be held or their duration. Exemplifying the abuses which may occur in secret proceedings, this Court has repeatedly had before it cases where confessions have been obtained from suspects by coercive interrogation in secret.\n14\n While the circumstances in each of these cases have varied, in all of them, as well as in many others, the common element has been the suspect's interrogation by officers while he was held incommunicado without the presence of his counsel, his friends or relatives, or the public. As was said in a concurring opinion in Haley v. Ohio, \n332 \nU.S. 596\n, at 605: \"An impressive series of cases in this and other courts admonishes of the temptations to abuse of police endeavors to secure confessions from suspects, through protracted questioning, carried on in secrecy, with the inevitable disquietude and fears police interrogations naturally engender in individuals questioned while held incommunicado, without the aid of counsel and unprotected by the safeguards of a judicial inquiry.\"\n15\n Nothing \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 343]\n\u00a0\n would be better calculated to prevent misuse of official power in dealing with a witness or suspect than the scrutiny of his lawyer or friends or even of disinterested bystanders.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nA witness charged with committing contempt during the secret interrogation faces the gravest handicaps in defending against this charge. The interrogating officers may assert that he engaged in certain contumacious behavior before them and seek to imprison him. Even when the charges are tried by someone other than his interrogators,\n17\n the accused's efforts to show that the actual events were not as pictured by the interrogating officers would normally be futile if he could call on no one to corroborate his testimony. And when a witness is deprived of the advice of counsel he may be completely \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 344]\n\u00a0\n unaware that his conduct has crossed the obscure boundary and become contemptuous. Moreover, executive officers will be somewhat more chary in exercising the dangerous contempt power if their actions are subject to external scrutiny.\n\nI also firmly believe that the Due Process Clause requires that a person interrogated be allowed to use legal counsel whenever he is compelled to give testimony to law-enforcement officers which may be instrumental in his prosecution and conviction for a criminal offense. This Court has repeatedly held that an accused in a state criminal prosecution has an unqualified right to make use of counsel at every stage of the proceedings against him.\n18\n The broader implications of these decisions seem to me to support appellants' right to use their counsel when questioned by the Deputy Fire Marshal. It may be that the type of interrogation which the Fire Marshal and his deputies are authorized to conduct would not technically fit into the traditional category of formal criminal proceedings, but the substantive effect of such interrogation on an eventual criminal prosecution of the person questioned can be so great that he should not be compelled to give testimony when he is deprived of the advice of his counsel. It is quite possible that the conviction of a person charged with arson or a similar crime may be attributable largely to his interrogation by the Fire Marshal. The right to use counsel at the formal trial is a very hollow thing when, for all practical purposes, the conviction is already assured by pretrial examination.\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 345]\n\u00a0\n\n\nLooking at the substance of things, the Fire Marshal's secret interrogation contains many of the dangers to an accused that would be present if he were partially tried in secret without the assistance of counsel for \"arson or a similar crime.\" Suppose that at the commencement of a criminal trial, the judge, acting under statutory authorization, expelled everyone from the courtroom but the prosecuting attorney and his assistants and allowed them to question the accused \"privately.\" After such interrogation the doors were thrown open, the jury recalled, and the jurors given a resume or transcript of the accused's purported testimony. And then the defendant's lawyer, who had been excluded from the secret examination, was allowed to make such defense as he could. Surely no one would contend that such a proceeding was due process of law. Yet the techniques as well as the end effects of the Fire Marshal's secret interrogation are substantially the same.\n\nIt is said that a witness can protect himself against some of the many abuses possible in a secret interrogation by asserting the privilege against self-incrimination. But this proposition collapses under anything more than the most superficial consideration. The average witness has little if any idea when or how to raise any of his constitutional privileges. There is no requirement in the Ohio statutes that the fire-prevention officers must inform the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 346]\n\u00a0\n witness that he is privileged not to incriminate himself. And in view of the intricate possibilities of waiver which surround the privilege he may easily unwittingly waive it.\n20\n If the witness is coerced or misled by his interrogators he may not dare to raise the privilege. Undoubtedly he will be made aware that hanging over his head at all times is the officer's power to punish him for contempt - a power whose limitations the witness will not understand. Furthermore, the Fire Marshal or his deputies would seldom be competent to decide if the privilege has been properly claimed or, even if they wish, to instruct the witness how to make correct use of it.\n\nTo support its decision that Ohio can punish a witness for refusing to submit to the Fire Marshal's secret interrogation, the majority places heavy reliance on the practice of examining witnesses before a grand jury in secret without the presence of the witness' counsel. But any surface support the grand jury practice may lend disappears upon analysis of that institution. The traditional English and American grand jury is composed of 12 to 23 members selected from the general citizenry of the locality where the alleged crime was committed.\n21\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 347]\n\u00a0\n They bring into the grand jury room the experience, knowledge and viewpoint of all sections of the community. They have no axes to grind and are not charged personally with the administration of the law. No one of them is a prosecuting attorney or law-enforcement officer ferreting out crime. It would be very difficult for officers of the state seriously to abuse or deceive a witness in the presence of the grand jury. Similarly the presence of the jurors offers a substantial safeguard against the officers' misrepresentation, unintentional or otherwise, of the witness' statements and conduct before the grand jury. The witness can call on the grand jurors if need be for their normally unbiased testimony as to what occurred before them.\n\nThe majority also relies on a supposed proposition that there is no right to use counsel in an administrative investigation.\n22\n Here it is relevant and significant to point out that in 1946 Congress specifically required in the Administrative Procedure Act that:\n\n \"Any person compelled to appear in person before any agency or representative thereof shall be accorded the right to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel or, if permitted by the agency, by other qualified representative.\"\n23\n\u00a0\n\n\n In reporting the bill which was substantially enacted as the Administrative Procedure Act the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously declared:\n\n\"By enacting this bill, the Congress - expressing the will of the people - will be laying down for the guidance of all branches of the Government and all \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 348]\n\u00a0\n private interests in the country a policy respecting the minimum requirements of fair administrative procedure.\"\n24\n\u00a0\n\n\n And the House Judiciary Committee in reporting the House version of the Administrative Procedure Act stated:\n\n\"The bill is an outline of minimum essential rights and procedures.\"\n25\n\u00a0\n\n\n Heretofore this Court has never held and I would never agree that an administrative agency conducting an investigation could validly compel a witness to appear before it and testify in secret without the assistance of his counsel.\n\nIn any event, the investigations authorized by the Ohio statutes are far more than mere administrative inquiries for securing information useful generally in the prevention of fires. Rather, these statutes command action with a view toward the apprehension and prosecution of persons believed guilty of certain crimes. The Marshal or his deputies may compel a person suspected of arson or a similar offense - as appellants apparently were - to appear and give testimony under oath. And as previously indicated any statement elicited from such person may be used as evidence against him. Once testimony has been taken from a suspect the duties of the Marshal and his deputies are not at an end. They must arrest the witness if they believe that the evidence is sufficient to charge him with certain crimes. All testimony taken from him and all other evidence must be turned over to the prosecuting attorney. The Fire Marshal and his deputy in charge of the \"Arson Bureau\" are specifically made \". . . responsible . . . for the prosecution of persons believed to be guilty of arson or a similar crime.\" \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 349]\n\u00a0\n The foregoing clearly demonstrates that the Fire Marshal's interrogation is, and apparently was intended to be, an important and integral part in the prosecution of the persons for arson or a similar crime.\n26\n The rights of a person who is examined in connection with such crimes should not be destroyed merely because the inquiry is given the euphonious label \"administrative.\"\n27\n\u00a0\n\nFinally it is argued that the Fire Marshal and his deputies should have the right to exclude counsel and such other persons as they choose so that their \"investigatory proceedings\" will not be \"unduly encumbered.\" From all that appears the primary manner in which the presence of counsel or the public would \"encumber\" the interrogation would be by protecting the legitimate rights of the witness.\n28\n It is undeniable that law-enforcement officers could rack up more convictions if they were not \"hampered\" by the defendant's counsel or the presence of others who might report to the public the manner in which people were being convicted.\n29\n But the procedural safeguards \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 350]\n\u00a0\n deemed essential for due process have been imposed deliberately with full knowledge that they will occasionally impede the conviction of persons suspected of crime.\n\nThe majority states that \"with so weighty a public interest as fire prevention to protect,\" they cannot hold that it violates the Due Process Clause to compel a witness to testify at a secret proceeding. But is the public's interest in fire prevention so weighty that it requires denying the person interrogated the basic procedural safeguards essential to justice? Suppose that Ohio authorized the Chief of State Police and his deputies to inquire into the causes and circumstances of crime generally and gave them power to compel witnesses or persons suspected of crime to appear and give testimony in secret. Since the public's interest in crime prevention is at least as great as its interest in fire prevention, the reasoning used in the majority's opinion would lead to the approval of such means of \"law enforcement.\" In fact, the opinion could readily be applied to sanction a grant of similar power to every state trooper, policeman, sheriff, marshal, constable, FBI agent, prosecuting attorney, immigration official,\n30\n narcotics agent, health officer, sanitation inspector, building inspector, tax collector, customs officer and to all the other countless state and federal officials who have authority to investigate violations of the law.\n31\n I believe that the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 351]\n\u00a0\n majority opinion offers a completely novel and extremely dangerous precedent - one that could be used to destroy a society of liberty under law and to establish in its place authoritarian government.\n\nNo one disputes that Ohio has a great interest in the enforcement of its fire laws. But there is nothing which suggests that it is essential to adequate enforcement of these laws to give the Fire Marshal and his deputies the extreme powers of interrogation which they proposed to exercise here. This method of law enforcement has heretofore been deemed inconsistent with our system of justice. As MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER said in announcing the Court's judgment in Watts v. Indiana, \n338 \nU.S. 49\n, at 54:\n\n\"Ours is the accusatorial as opposed to the inquisitorial system. Such has been the characteristic of Anglo-American criminal justice since it freed itself from practices borrowed by the Star Chamber from the Continent whereby an accused was interrogated in secret for hours on end. . . . Under our system society carries the burden of proving its charge against the accused not out of his own mouth. It must establish its case, not by interrogation of the accused even under judicial safeguards, but by evidence independently secured through skillful investigation.\"\n32\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 352]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Secret inquisitions are dangerous things justly feared by free men everywhere.\n33\n They are the breeding place for arbitrary misuse of official power. They are often \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 353]\n\u00a0\n the beginning of tyranny as well as indispensable instruments for its survival. Modern as well as ancient history bears witness that both innocent and guilty have been seized by officers of the state and whisked away for secret interrogation or worse until the groundwork has been securely laid for their inevitable conviction. While the labels applied to this practice have frequently changed, the central idea wherever and whenever carried out remains unchanging - extraction of \"statements\" by one means or another from an individual by officers of the state while he is held incommunicado. I reiterate my belief that it violates the Due Process Clause to compel a person to answer questions at a secret interrogation where he is denied legal assistance and where he is subject to the uncontrolled and invisible exercise of power by government officials. Such procedures are a grave threat to the liberties of a free people.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] James Otis used this phrase in denouncing the Writs of Assistance and General Warrants in his famous argument in Paxton's Case. 2 The Works of John Adams (Boston 1850), App. 524.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257, 273\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45, 69\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Page's Ohio Rev.

This Court has expressly held that a person charged with contempt has a constitutional right to be heard through counsel of his own choosing at a trial on the contempt charge. In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257\n. While the majority refuses to act on the denial here by claiming that appellants failed to challenge it in the Ohio Supreme Court or in their appeal to this Court, the record convinces me that the matter has been properly raised for our consideration. When a person is to be imprisoned as the result of a proceeding in which he was denied his constitutional rights, we should not be anxious to conclude that he has failed to raise the constitutional questions in the correct procedural form. Cf. Aetna Ins. Co. v. Kennedy, \n301 \nU.S. 389, 393\n; Hodges v. Easton, \n106 \nU.S. 408, 412\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See generally 15 Ohio Jur. 2d, Criminal Law 388.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] In this respect it is important to note that under the Ohio statutes the Fire Marshal or his deputies may permit such persons as they wish to attend the interrogation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] This has been recognized from ancient times. As said in Matthew 18:15-16:\n\n\"Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.\"\n\n\n Blackstone many centuries later noted that:\n\n\"[The] open examination of witnesses viva voce, in the presence of all mankind, is much more conducive to the clearing up of truth, than the private and secret examination taken down in writing before an officer, or his clerk . . . . There an artful or careless scribe may make a witness speak what he never meant . . . .\" 3 Blackstone Commentaries 373.\n\n\n And Bentham subsequently pointed out:\n\n\"In case of registration and recordation of the evidence, publicity serves as a security for the correctness in every respect (completeness included) of the work of the registrator.\n\n\n\"In case of material incorrectness, whether by design or inadvertence, - so many auditors present . . . any or each of whom may eventually be capable of indicating, in the character of a witness, the existence of the error, and the tenor (or at least the purport) of the alteration requisite for the correction of it.\" 1 Bentham, Rationale of Judicial Evidence (1827), 523.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] See, e. g., Fikes v. Alabama, \n352 \nU.S. 191\n; Leyra v. Denno, \n347 \nU.S. 556\n; Watts v. Indiana, \n338 \nU.S. 49\n; Turner v. Pennsylvania, \n338 \nU.S. 62\n; Harris v. South Carolina, \n338 \nU.S. 68\n; Haley v. Ohio, \n332 \nU.S. 596\n; Malinski v. New York, \n324 \nU.S. 401\n; Ashcraft v. Tennessee, \n322 \nU.S. 143\n; Ward v. Texas, \n316 \nU.S. 547\n; White v. Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 530\n; Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n. For a discussion of the dangers and abuses arising from the secret interrogation of suspects by police see the report of the American Bar Association's Committee on Lawless Enforcement of the Law, Aug. 19, 1930. 1 Am. J. Police Science 575.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] In United States v. Minker, \n350 \nU.S. 179\n, the Court, at p. 188, pointed out with regard to proposed examinations by immigration officers that:\n\n\"It does not bespeak deprecation of official zeal, nor does it bring into question disinterestedness, to conclude that compulsory ex parte administrative examinations, untrammeled by the safeguards of a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 343]\n\u00a0\n public adversary judicial proceeding, afford too ready opportunities for unhappy consequences to prospective defendants in denaturalization suits.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] It seems wholly improper to \"wait and see\" in each case whether a witness has been coerced or tricked into giving involuntary statements at the secret interrogation and then to set aside convictions which may be based on such statements. This \"abuse-by-abuse\" approach fails to give the person interrogated sufficient protection. Usually he has no substantial chance of showing that the one or more interrogators used improper means to elicit involuntary statements from him. Only in the most extreme cases will this Court, or any other, be able to find that statements were made involuntarily in the face of the interrogating officers' testimony that they were spontaneous and freely given. Apparently in Ohio, as in most jurisdictions, the suspect faces the additional obstacle that his alleged statements are presumed to be voluntary and he has the burden of proving that they were not. See 15 Ohio Jur. 2d, Criminal Law 387. In the few cases where a person interrogated could prove that his statements were made involuntarily he will still be subjected to considerable expense, inconvenience and unfavorable publicity. More important, he will already have suffered mistreatment at the hands of his interrogators.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Here, of course, the interrogators were authorized to try the charges of contempt which they preferred.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] See, e. g., Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n; Chandler v. Fretag, \n348 \nU.S. 3\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] This was recognized in Ex parte Sullivan, 107 F. Supp. 514. There two persons suspected of crime had been examined by law-enforcement officers in secret without the presence of counsel and had been tricked into making statements which were instrumental in their conviction. At pp. 517-518, the district judge observed:\n\n\"In view of [Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n], to mention but one \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 345]\n\u00a0\n of many cases, unquestionably Petitioners were entitled to have effective counsel at the trial. The question here is how they ever could have had effective counsel at the trial, no matter how skilled, in view of what went on before trial. They were denied effective counsel at the trial itself because of what went on before trial while the defendants were without counsel, and absolutely under the control of the prosecution. . . . One can imagine a cynical prosecutor saying: `Let them have the most illustrious counsel, now. They can't escape the noose. There is nothing that counsel can do for them at the trial.'\" (Emphasis not supplied.)\n\n\n Also see Jackson, J., concurring in Watts v. Indiana, \n338 \nU.S. 49, 57\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] See, e. g., Rogers v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 367\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] All of the cases cited by the majority as authority for the practice before grand juries apparently involved a traditional grand jury. It has been suggested that a state can constitutionally provide for grand juries composed of less than 12 persons. See In re Murchison, \n349 \nU.S. 133, 139\n, 140 (dissenting opinion); In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257, 283\n, 283-284 (dissenting opinion). Even if this suggestion is correct it certainly does not follow that a state can designate one or more of its law-enforcement officers as a grand jury and constitutionally give them power to compel witnesses to appear and give testimony in secret without the presence of counsel. This point was expressly not considered in In re Oliver, supra, at 265. Such power in the hands of law-enforcement officers is equally obnoxious to due process whether they are styled as a grand jury, as fire-prevention officers or simply as policemen.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] The only authorities offered by the majority as support for this proposition are three lower federal court decisions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] 5 U.S.C. 1005 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. 31.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] H. R. Rep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 16.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] It seems highly unrealistic to equate this interrogation with a proceeding involving a claim for workmen's compensation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] Nor should they be defeated because the Fire Marshal and his deputies are given other duties besides investigating fires to determine if any criminality is involved. For obvious reasons these other responsibilities do not make the interrogation proposed here any less objectionable.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] Perhaps, if a real need could be shown, counsel could be restricted to advising his client and prohibited from making statements or asking questions. And there are other alternatives, much less drastic and prejudicial to the witness than the complete exclusion of his counsel, which might provide satisfactory protection for the witness without unduly impairing the efficiency of the examination.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] As Bentham said of criminal proceedings:\n\n\"Without publicity, all other checks are insufficient: in comparison of publicity, all other checks are of small account. Recordation, appeal, whatever other institutions might present themselves in the character of checks, would be found to operate rather as cloaks than checks; as cloaks in reality, as checks only in appearance.\" 1 Bentham, Rationale of Judicial Evidence (1827), 524.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] See United States v. Minker, \n350 \nU.S. 179\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] The Court's opinion does not deny that secret inquisitorial powers could be given such law-enforcement officers. A concurring opinion suggests that the grant of such broad power might be unconstitutional so far as a district attorney is concerned. However if policemen in general could constitutionally subject persons to secret compulsory interrogation, how can it be said that a district attorney could not? For constitutional purposes I can see no means of distinguishing this Ohio fire policeman from any other policeman or law-enforcement officer. Any attempted constitutional distinction between these various law-enforcement officers would be purely \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 351]\n\u00a0\n artificial. The constitutionality of the Ohio law authorizing secret interrogation by fire marshals acting as policemen in arson cases should not be rested on a conjecture that such an artificial distinction will be drawn by this Court at some future day.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] A survey of British law reveals nothing which is equivalent to the type of examination that the Ohio Fire Marshal is allowed to conduct. Official inquiries into the cause of fires are generally made by the police. \"[W]hen the police are inquiring into a case, they have no power to compel anyone to give them information; a witness may be compelled to attend a court and there give evidence, but before proceedings are actually brought he can refuse \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 352]\n\u00a0\n to say a word.\" Jackson, The Machinery of Justice in England (2d ed. 1953), 137. And in 1929 the Report of the Royal Commission on Police Powers and Procedure at p. 118 recommended that \"A rigid instruction should be issued to the Police that no questioning of a prisoner, or a `person in custody,' about any crime or offense with which he is, or may be, charged, should be permitted.\" It is doubtful if any statements obtained by the police by secret interrogation of a suspect would be admitted in evidence in a subsequent trial. See Rex v. Grayson, 16 Crim. App. R. 7 (1921); 43 Harv. L. Rev. 618; 43 Ky. L. Rev. 403.\n\nIn France official inquiries into fires are carried out as part of the general system of investigating crimes. The preliminary investigation is under the control of the public prosecutor and is conducted by the police. They have no authority to examine unwilling witnesses. The interrogation of such witnesses and of suspects is the function of the Juge d'Instruction, who is a judge with legal training. Prior to 1897 he had broad power to examine a witness under oath in secret without counsel. See Ploscowe, Development of Inquisitorial and Accusatorial Elements in French Procedure, 23 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 372. In 1882 Stephen commented on these secret proceedings as follows:\n\n\"To a person accustomed to the English system and to English ways of thinking and feeling . . . the French system would be utterly intolerable in England. The substitution of a secret [interrogation] for our open investigation before the committing magistrate would appear to us to poison justice at its source.\" 1 Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of England (1883), 565.\n\n\n In response to widespread demands French law was changed in 1897 to grant a witness appearing before the Juge d'Instruction the right to counsel. M. Constans, one of the sponsors of the law in the French Senate, said: \"The juge d'instruction is like other functionaries. He must be controlled. . . The presence of the lawyer will of itself . . . prevent him from doing anything but his duty.\" Quoted in Ploscowe, supra, at 381. See also Esmein, History of Continental Criminal Procedure (1913); Keedy, The Preliminary Investigation of Crime in France, 88 U. Pa. L. Rev. 692.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] A leading Italian jurist recently said:\n\n\"The right to counsel, without which the right to defend oneself \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 353]\n\u00a0\n is of no practical meaning, does not exist during the first phase of the criminal process in those systems in which the pre-trial phase is carried out in secret without the presence of defense counsel. This is the phase in which the accused, alone and undefended before the examining magistrate, may be unable to find in his own innocence sufficient strength to resist the effects of prolonged questioning, and in order to put an end to his ordeal may be reduced to signing a confession to a crime he has not committed. Unfortunately, Italian criminal procedure retains this sad inheritance from an era of tyranny, which is unreconcilable with respect for the human personality . . . .\n\n.  .  .  .   .\n\n\n\n\"In criminal procedure as we see it applied, the accused is still an inert object at the mercy of the inquisitor's violence. . . . Held incommunicado during the period of questioning, the accused is alone with his examiners, without aid of counsel; torture, although formally abolished, has returned under new guises more scientific but nonetheless cruel: the third degree, endless hours of incessant questioning, truth serum.\" Calamandrei, Procedure and Democracy (Adams transl. 1956), 93-94, 102-103. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 330, 354]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE LAMKIN(1957)\nNo. 275\nArgued: Decided: November 18, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Certiorari denied.\n\n The judgment below rests on an adequate state ground since petitioner, in filing his application for habeas corpus in the state court, failed to comply with applicable state procedures.\n\n The stay is continued to December 18, 1957, to afford petitioner an opportunity to file application for relief in the appropriate state court, and in event of denial of same in the highest court of the State, to renew in this Court an application for writ of certiorari.\n\n Reported below: 164 Tex.

TAYLOR(1957)\nNo. 619\nArgued: April 30, 1957Decided: June 3, 1957\n\n\n\n\n A general court-martial found a soldier guilty of the separate offenses of premeditated murder and attempted rape and, in accordance with the usual practice, gave him an aggregate sentence of life imprisonment for both offenses. The Army Board of Review set aside the conviction on the murder charge; but it sustained the conviction for attempted rape and reduced the sentence to 20 years' imprisonment, which is the maximum sentence for attempted rape. In a habeas corpus proceeding, the soldier challenged the validity of the reduced sentence. Held: The action of the Board of Review in modifying the sentence to 20 years' imprisonment was authorized by Article 66 (c) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and it is sustained. Pp. 570-580.\n\n (a) A different result is not required by the facts that the law officer of the court-martial advised the court-martial that, in view of the finding on the murder charge, it had only two alternatives, a death sentence of life imprisonment, and that he made no reference to punishment for attempted rape, the maximum for which is 20 years. Pp. 573-574.\n\n\n (b) The Board of Review had authority under Article 66 (c) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to modify the life sentence to 20 years after the murder conviction was set aside. Pp. 574-577.\n\n\n (c) In view of the gross-sentence practice required in court-martial proceedings and the power vested by law in the Board of Review to correct such a sentence, the Board's action cannot be set aside on the conjecture that the court-martial might have imposed less than the maximum sentence for attempted rape had it considered that offense separately. Pp. 577-579.\n\n\n (d) The case should not be remanded for a rehearing before the court-martial on the question of sentence, since there is no specific authority for doing so under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and Congress intended that the Board of Review should exercise this power. P. 579.\n\n\n (e) Nor should the case be remanded for rehearing before a new court-martial, since the function of reviewing such sentences is vested by law in the Board of Review. Pp. 579-580. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 570]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (f) Since the sentence here involved was legally imposed by military authorities, its severity is not reviewable on habeas corpus in the civil courts.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and James W. Booth.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a habeas corpus proceeding in which petitioner, a soldier, attacks the validity of a sentence of 20 years he is now serving as the result of his conviction by an Army court-martial of the offense of attempted rape. While serving in the United States Army in Korea, he was found guilty by a general court-martial of the separate offenses of premeditated murder and attempted rape of a Korean woman. He was given an aggregate sentence\n1\n of life imprisonment for both offenses. The Army board of review found \"incorrect in law and fact\" the court-martial finding of guilty on the murder charge, but it approved the guilty finding for attempted rape. As to the sentence, the board found \"that only so much of the approved sentence as provides for dishonorable discharge, total forfeitures, and confinement at hard labor for 20 years is correct in law and fact.\" As so modified, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 571]\n\u00a0\n it approved the sentence. United States v. Fowler, 2 C. M. R. 336. The petitioner makes no attack on his original conviction on the attempted rape charge and its affirmance by the board. But he attacks the sentence of the board alleging that \"the action of the Review Board in reserving twenty (20) years of the life sentence imposed by the Court-Martial for the crime of murder, even though it had reserved and set aside the conviction, was null and void.\" The District Court denied the writ and discharged the rule to show cause, Jackson v. Humphrey, 135 F. Supp. 776, holding that the board of review on reversing the murder conviction, properly modified the sentence and was not required to order a new trial or to remand the case for resentencing by the general court-martial. The Court of Appeals, in a unanimous opinion, affirmed. Jackson v. Taylor, 234 F.2d 611. It held that the board of review upon affirming the attempted rape conviction was authorized to \"affirm . . . such part or amount of the sentence, as it finds correct,\" citing Article 66 (c) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 64 Stat. 128, 50 U.S.C. 653 (c). We believe the sentence must stand.\n\nPetitioner was tried with two other soldiers and each was convicted of the same offenses, premeditated murder and attempted rape. Each was also sentenced to life imprisonment. The record of the trial was then forwarded to the convening authority where the convictions and sentences were approved. In accordance with military procedure, the record was then forwarded with the convening authority's approval to a board of review in the office of the Judge Advocate General of the Army. That board, as already stated, found the murder convictions unsupported by the record and set them aside, but sustained the convictions for attempted rape and modified the sentences. The soldiers then sought further review by petition before the United States Court of Military \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 572]\n\u00a0\n Appeals. No question regarding the authority of the review board to modify the sentences was raised and the petition was denied without opinion. United States v. Fowler, 1 U.S.C. M. A. 713. The soldiers, having started to serve their sentences, were held in different prisons. Each filed a writ of habeas corpus in the district in which he was imprisoned and each raised the same issue of the authority of the board of review to sentence in the manner described. A conflict between the Circuits has resulted\n2\n and we granted certiorari, limited to the gross sentence question, not only to resolve this conflict but to settle an important question in the administration of the Uniform Code. \n352 \nU.S. 940\n.\n\nPetitioner claims no deprivation of constitutional rights. He argues only that under military law the board of review should have ordered either a rehearing or that he be released because it was without authority to impose the 20-year sentence.\n\nThe review board derives its power from Article 66 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 64 Stat. 128, 50 U.S.C. 653.\n3\n We are concerned more particularly with subsection (c) of that section. It provides:\n\n \"(c) In a case referred to it, the board of review shall act only with respect to the findings and sentence \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 573]\n\u00a0\n as approved by the convening authority. It shall affirm only such findings of guilty, and the sentence or such part or amount of the sentence, as it finds correct in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved. In considering the record it shall have authority to weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses.\"\n\n\n Here the board relied on its power to \"affirm . . . such part or amount of the sentence, as it finds correct . . . .\" Petitioner argues, however, that the 20-year sentence was not a \"part or amount\" of the sentence imposed by the court-martial. He supports this by reference to the action of the law officer of the court-martial who, after the findings of guilt were returned, advised its members in open court of the punishment it might impose. In view of the finding on the murder charge, he told the court-martial it had only two alternatives, a death sentence or life imprisonment. Art. of War 92, 62 Stat. 640. He made no reference to the punishment for attempted rape, the maximum for which is 20 years. Since the court-martial was required to impose a single sentence covering both of the guilty findings,\n4\n it entered a life sentence. Petitioner claims there was no sentence on the attempted rape conviction and, therefore, the entry of a 20-year sentence thereon by the board was an entirely new and independent imposition which was beyond its power. He bases this conclusion wholly on deduction. He contends that since the law officer advised the court-martial only as to the punishment for murder it follows that it did not sentence him on the attempted rape charge. But why should the officer go through the useless motion \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 574]\n\u00a0\n of instructing on the attempted rape when the court-martial by law was required to impose a sentence of death or life imprisonment? The sentence could have been no heavier unless it were death. What possible good would it have done for the court-martial, if it had been authorized, to add 20 or any other number of years onto a life sentence? In addition to the fact that the Uniform Code authorizes no such sentence we should not construe the Act of Congress to require the doing of a useless act.\n\nBut, the petitioner says, simple arithmetic shows that no sentence was imposed on the attempted rape finding. He reasons that the offense of premeditated murder carries a minimum punishment of life imprisonment, the exact sentence he received. The sentence therefore included no punishment covering the attempted rape finding he claims. It is true that the sentence was not broken down as to offenses. That is not permitted. However, the petitioner in his analysis overlooks entirely the requirement of military law that only the entry of a single gross sentence for both of the offenses is permitted. This Court has approved this practice. Carter v. McClaughry, \n183 \nU.S. 365, 393\n (1902). See also McDonald v. Lee, 217 F.2d 619, 622 (1954); Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed. 1920), 404. The sentence here was a gross sentence. It covered both the convictions. What the petitioner would have us do is to strike down this long practice, not only approved over the years by the Congress but by our cases. This we cannot do.\n\nThe question remains whether the board had the authority to modify the life sentence to 20 years after the murder conviction was set aside. Reviewing authorities have broad powers under military law.\n5\n Unlike a \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 575]\n\u00a0\n civilian trial in most jurisdictions, the initial sentence under military law is imposed by the members of the court-martial. Otherwise the court-martial performs functions more like those of a jury than a court. It is composed of laymen. See Art. 25 of the Uniform Code, 64 Stat. 116, 50 U.S.C. 589. The powers of review, modification, and sentence-adjustment under the Uniform Code rest elsewhere than on this body of laymen.\n\nReview of a court-martial conviction is first provided by the convening authority - the commanding officer who directed that the case be tried before a court-martial. He is empowered to reduce a sentence though he cannot increase it. He can weigh facts, determine credibility of witnesses, disapprove findings of guilt which he believes erroneous in law or fact, and determine sentence appropriateness without regard to what the court-martial might have done had it considered only the approved findings. Art. 64 of the Uniform Code, 64 Stat. 128, 50 U.S.C. 651. He has other broad powers. See Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1951), c. 17. Here the convening authority approved the action of the court-martial.\n\nThe next stage of review is that with which we are particularly concerned. It is conducted by the board of review composed of legally-trained officers.\n6\n Such boards first received statutory recognition in 1920. Art. of War 50 1\/2, 41 Stat. 797-799. At that time Congress gave them power to review, with the Judge Advocate General, records for legal sufficiency. By 1949 this power \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 576]\n\u00a0\n was increased to weigh facts, though, as petitioner argues, these boards still did not have power to determine sentence appropriateness. Art. of War 50 (g), 62 Stat. 637. Such power was, however, given to the Judge Advocate General and a Judicial Council.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nAgainst this background of broad powers of review under military law, Congress began the drafting of the new Uniform Code of Military Justice. Their work culminated, so far as we are here concerned, with Article 66 (c), supra. Petitioner finds the language of this section ambiguous and argues that any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the accused. That would be true if there were ambiguity in the section. But the words are clear. The board may \"affirm . . . such part or amount of the sentence, as it finds correct . . . .\" That is precisely what the review board did here. It affirmed such part, 20 years, of the sentence, life imprisonment, as it found correct in fact and law for the offense of attempted rape. Were the words themselves unclear, the teachings from the legislative history of the section would compel the same result.\n\nThe Uniform Code was drafted by a committee chairmanned by Professor Edmund M. Morgan, Jr. In testifying before the Senate Subcommittee which considered the bill, Professor Morgan stated with reference to the review board that it now\n\n \"has very extensive powers. It may review law,  facts, and practically, sentences; because the provisions  stipulate that the board of review shall affirm  only so much of the sentence as it finds to be justified  by the whole record. It gives the board of  review . . . the power to review facts, law and sentence \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 577]\n\u00a0\n  . . . .\" Hearings before a Subcommittee of  the Senate Committee on Armed Services on S. 857  and H. R. 4080, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 42.\n\n\n Military officials opposed giving the review boards power to alter sentences. Id., at 262, 285. The Subcommittee nevertheless decided the boards should have that power. Id., at 311. The Committee Report to the Senate augments the conclusion that the boards of review were to have the power to alter sentences.\n8\n A study of the legislative history of the Code in the House of Representatives leads to the same conclusion. See H. R. Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 31; 95 Cong. Rec. 5729. Article 66 was enacted in the language approved by the committees. It is manifest then that it was the intent of Congress that a board of review should exercise just such authority as was exercised here.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nBoards of review have been altering sentences from the inception of the Code provision. These alterations have been attacked but have found approval in the courts as \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 578]\n\u00a0\n is shown by the list of cases collected in the opinion of Judge Hastie in the Court of Appeals. 234 F.2d, at 614, n. 3. Petitioner objects, however, that the board of review should not have imposed the maximum sentence for attempted rape because the court-martial might have imposed a lesser sentence had it considered the matter initially. But this is an objection that might properly be addressed to Congress. It has laid down the military law and it can take it away or restrict it. The Congress could have required a court-martial to enter a sentence on each separate offense just as is done in the civilian courts. The board of review would then know the attitude of the court-martial as to punishment on each of its findings of guilt. But this the Congress did not do. The argument, therefore, falls since it is based on pure conjecture. No one could say what sentence the court-martial would have imposed if it had found petitioner guilty only of attempted rape. But Congress avoided the necessity for conjecture and speculation by placing authority in the board of review to correct not only the findings as to guilt but the sentence as well. Likewise the apportionment of the sentence that the court-martial intended as between the offenses would be pure speculation.\n10\n But because of the gross sentence procedure in military law we need not concern ourselves with these problems. Military law \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 579]\n\u00a0\n provides that one aggregate sentence must be imposed and the board of review may modify that sentence in the manner it finds appropriate. To say in this case that a gross sentence was not imposed is to shut one's eyes to the realities of military law and custom.\n\nFinally the petitioner suggests that the case should be remanded for a rehearing before the court-martial on the question of the sentence. We find no authority in the Uniform Code for such a procedure and the petitioner points to none.\n11\n The reason is, of course, that the Congress intended that the board of review should exercise this power. This is true because the nature of a court-martial proceeding makes it impractical and unfeasible to remand for the purpose of sentencing alone. See United States v. Keith, 1 U.S.C. M. A. 442, 451, 4 C. M. R. 34, 43 (1952). Even petitioner admits that it would now, six years after the trial, be impractical to attempt to reconvene the court-martial that decided the case originally. A court-martial has neither continuity nor situs and often sits to hear only a single case. Because of the nature of military service, the members of a court-martial may be scattered throughout the world within a short time after a trial is concluded. Recognizing the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 580]\n\u00a0\n impossibility of remand to the same court-martial, petitioner suggests as an alternative that the case should be remanded for a rehearing before a new court-martial.\n12\n He admits that it would now be impractical for such a new court-martial to hear all of the evidence, and that the court would have to make its sentence determination on the basis of what it could learn from reading the record. Such a procedure would merely substitute one group of nonparticipants in the original trial for another. Congress thought the board of review could modify sentences when appropriate more expeditiously, more intelligently, and more fairly. Acting on a national basis the board of review can correct disparities in sentences and through its legally-trained personnel determine more appropriately the proper disposition to be made of the cases. Congress must have known of the problems inherent in rehearing and review proceedings for the procedures were adopted largely from prior law. It is not for us to question the judgment of the Congress in selecting the process it chose.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1951), App. 8, at 521, specifically provides, inter alia: \"The court will adjudge a single sentence for all the offenses of which the accused was found guilty.\" This sentence is known as an \"aggregate\" or \"gross\" sentence. A court-martial may not impose separate sentences for each finding of guilt, but may impose only a single, unitary sentence covering all of the guilty findings in their entirety, no matter how many such findings there may be.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Carl De Coster, one of the codefendants with petitioner, was released on an order of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. See De Coster v. Madigan, 223 F.2d 906 (1955). The other codefendant, Harriel Fowler, was denied release by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. See Wilkinson v. Fowler, 234 F.2d 615 (1956). While no petition was filed in the De Coster case, we granted certiorari in both the petitioner's and Fowler's cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Since this action was filed this section has been revised and recodified as 70A Stat. 59, 10 U.S.C.

It is contemplated that this power will be exercised to establish uniformity of sentences throughout the armed forces.\" S. Rep. No. 486, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 28.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Commentators have recognized this power of sentence review since the enactment of the Code. See, e. g., Currier and Kent, The Boards of Review of the Armed Services, 6 Vand. L. Rev. 241 (1953). \"The greatest single change brought about in the powers and duties of the boards of review by the Uniform Code of Military Justice is the power of the board to affirm only so much of the sentence in a given case as it finds appropriate.\" Id., at 242. See also 65 Yale L. J. 413.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Petitioner complains that the 20-year sentence for attempted rape was excessive. He argues that because the court-martial gave him the minimum sentence for premeditated murder, it would not have given the maximum sentence for attempted rape. We need not speculate on what the court-martial would have done, nor will we interfere with the discretion exercised by the board of review. It held that in the \"vicious circumstances of this case,\" 20 years was an appropriate sentence. Furthermore, since the sentence was legally imposed, its severity is not reviewable on habeas corpus in the civil courts. Carter v. McClaughry, \n183 \nU.S. 365, 401\n (1902).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The United States Court of Military Appeals in United States v. Field, 5 U.S.C. M. A. 379, 18 C. M. R. 3 (1955), hesitatingly suggested in dictum that a convening authority might return a case to a court-martial solely for the purpose of a reassessment of sentence on the findings of guilt affirmed by him. The court indicated that such a practice would be unlikely for \"obvious and compelling reasons of a practical character.\" Id., at 385, 18 C. M. R., at 9. It explicitly refused to express an opinion concerning the desirability of the practice. There, of course, was no suggestion that the practice was mandatory for the convening authority has, just as has the board of review, the power to modify a sentence to make it appropriate. See also United States v. Voorhees, 4 U.S.C. M. A. 509, 543, 16 C. M. R. 83, 117 (1954).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] It is well to point out that the Uniform Code permits the convening authority under limited circumstances to return a case for \"reconsideration and revision\" to a court-martial composed of \"only . . . the members of the court who participated in the findings and sentence.\" See Art. 62 of the Uniform Code, 64 Stat. 127, 50 U.S.C. 649, and Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1951), at 130. This would be impossible after the passage of time in nearly every case since the original court-martial could not be reassembled. On the other hand, if resentencing is a limited type of rehearing, the Uniform Code requires the rehearing to \"take place before a court-martial composed of members not members of the court-martial which first heard the case.\" (Emphasis added.) Art. 63 of the Uniform Code, 64 Stat. 127, 50 U.S.C. 650. Such a court-martial would be no more capable - if as capable - as a board of review. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 581]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nI am unable to see how the action of the Board of Review can fairly be characterized as other than an original imposition of sentence by the Board for the offense of attempted rape. The Uniform Code of Military Justice grants no power to the Board to impose original sentences. 64 Stat. 128, 50 U.S.C. 653. That power is reserved exclusively to the court-martial. There was, therefore, no valid gross sentence embracing attempted rape upon which the Board's power to remit an excessive portion could operate. I subscribe to what Judge Major said in the similar case of De Coster v. Madigan, 223 F.2d 906, 909-910 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1955), in which De Coster was allowed habeas corpus and ordered discharged:\n\n \". . . While the court-martial obviously had jurisdiction of plaintiff and the offenses with which he was charged, it did not fully and fairly deal with him. The Law Officer instructed the court-martial that the minimum sentence which could be imposed on the murder charge was life imprisonment. But the Law Officer gave no instructions as to the punishment which could be imposed on the attempted rape charge. The court-martial found plaintiff guilty of both murder and attempted rape, but its sentence was life-imprisonment, the minimum sentence for the murder charge alone. Of course, any suggestion that the court-martial should have sentenced plaintiff for a term of life plus twenty years would be ridiculous, but equally so is the assertion that the court-martial did or intended to impose any part of its sentence for attempted rape. It lacked even the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 582]\n\u00a0\n necessary instructions upon which such award of punishment would have to be based. Imposition of sentence by the proper authority is an essential step in administration of criminal justice. Here, under the statute, only the court-martial was authorized to take this step; it failed to do so.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 569, 583]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAFFKE v.

The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that petitioner had failed to prove his claim. In doing so, it refused to consider the action of the District Court in striking the affidavit, because petitioner had not cross-appealed. Held:\n\n 1. If the District Court erred in striking the affidavit, a cross-appeal by petitioner was not prerequisite to the Court of Appeals' considering the affidavit in support of the District Court's judgment. P. 281.\n\n\n 2. On remand of this case, the Court of Appeals should consider the questions of the admissibility and weight of the affidavit and whether relevant admissible evidence established a constructive trust under Illinois law. P. 281.\n\n\n 229 F.2d 232, reversed and remanded.\n\nHerbert J. Miller, Jr. argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Chauncey P. Carter, Jr. and William M. Giffin.\n\nG. W. Horsley argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nWe granted certiorari in this case to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 229 F.2d 232, reversing an order of the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, sitting in bankruptcy, which required respondent as trustee of a bankrupt's estate to pay $27,400 to petitioner. \n351 \nU.S. 949\n. The District Court's order was based on a finding that, subsequent to \n\n[352 \nU.S. 280, 281]\n\u00a0\n the date of the adjudication of bankruptcy, the bankrupt had obtained money by fraud from the petitioner and had turned over $27,400 of that money to respondent. At the hearing before the District Court, petitioner had sought to introduce into evidence an affidavit in which the bankrupt stated that he had paid $36,000 of the money he had received from petitioner to the respondent. At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court sustained respondent's motion to strike the affidavit.\n\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner had failed to prove that any specific portion of the money that he had given the bankrupt became a part of the funds in the hands of respondent. Because petitioner had not cross-appealed, the Court of Appeals held that it could not consider the action of the District Court in striking the bankrupt's affidavit from the record.\n\nA successful party in the District Court may sustain its judgment on any ground that finds support in the record. If the District Court was in error in striking an admissible affidavit, a cross-appeal was not a prerequisite for the Court of Appeals to rule on the admissibility of the affidavit, and finding it admissible, to find that it afforded evidence in support of the District Court judgment. United States v. American Railway Express Co., \n265 \nU.S. 425, 435\n-436; Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 538\n-539. Since the Court of Appeals did not consider the admissibility and weight of the affidavit, we remand to the Court of Appeals for its consideration of those issues.\n\nThe claim in this case is that relevant admissible evidence established a constructive trust. Whether it did so or not is a question of Illinois law. The Court of Appeals, in the view it took of the case before it, did not reach this local question. On remand, that question too must be considered by the Court of Appeals.\n\n    Reversed and remanded. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 280, 282]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJENCKS v. UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 23\nArgued: October 17, 1956Decided: June 3, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was convicted in a Federal District Court of violating 18 U.S.C. 1001 by filing, under 9 (h) of the National Labor Relation Act, as president of a labor union, an affidavit stating falsely that he was not a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such Party. Crucial testimony against him was given by two paid undercover agents for the F. B. I., who stated on cross-examination that they had made regular oral or written reports to the F. B. I. on the matters about which they had testified. Petitioner moved for the production of these reports in court for inspection by the judge with a view to their possible use by petitioner in impeaching such testimony. His motions were denied. Held: Denial of the motions was erroneous, and the conviction is reversed. Pp. 658-672.\n\n (a) Petitioner was not required to lay a preliminary foundation for his motion, showing inconsistency between the contents of the reports and the testimony of the government agents, because a sufficient foundation was established by their testimony that their reports were of the events and activities related in their testimony. Gordon v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 414\n, distinguished. Pp. 666-668.\n\n\n (b) Petitioner was entitled to an order directing the Government to produce for inspection all written reports of the F.

P. 668.\n\n\n (c) Petitioner is entitled to inspect the reports to decide whether to use them in his defense.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Tompkins, Clinton B. D. Brown and Harold D. Koffsky.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn April 28, 1950, the petitioner, as president of Amalgamated Bayard District Union, Local 890, International Union of Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers, filed an \"Affidavit of Non-Communist Union Officer\" with the National Labor Relations Board, pursuant to 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act.\n1\n He has been convicted under a two-count indictment charging that he \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 659]\n\u00a0\n violated 18 U.S.C. 1001\n2\n by falsely swearing in that affidavit that he was not on April 28, 1950, a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such Party. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the conviction,\n3\n and also an order of the District Court denying the petitioner's motion for a new trial.\n4\n This Court granted certiorari.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nTwo alleged trial errors are presented for our review. Harvey F. Matusow and J. W. Ford, the Government's principal witnesses, were Communist Party members paid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation contemporaneously to make oral or written reports of Communist Party activities in which they participated. They made such reports to the F. B. I. of activities allegedly participated in by the petitioner, about which they testified at the trial. Error is asserted in the denial by the trial judge of the petitioner's motions to direct the Government to produce these reports for inspection and use in cross-examining Matusow and Ford. Error is also alleged in the instructions given to the jury on membership, affiliation, and the credibility of informers.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nFormer Party members testified that they and the petitioner, as members of the Communist Party of New Mexico, had been expressly instructed to conceal their membership and not to carry membership cards. They also testified that the Party kept no membership records or minutes of membership meetings, and that such meetings were secretly arranged and clandestinely held. One of the witnesses said that special care was taken to conceal the Party membership of members, like the petitioner, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 660]\n\u00a0\n \"occupying strategic and important positions in labor unions and other organizations where public knowledge of their membership to non-Communists would jeopardize their position in the organization.\" Accordingly, the Government did not attempt to prove the petitioner's alleged membership in the Communist Party on April 28, 1950, with any direct admissions by the petitioner of membership, by proof of his compliance with Party membership requirements, or that his name appeared upon a membership roster, or that he carried a membership card.\n\nThe evidence relied upon by the Government was entirely circumstantial. It consisted of testimony of conduct of the petitioner from early 1946 through October 15, 1949, and of Matusow's testimony concerning alleged conversations between him and the petitioner at a vacation ranch in July or August 1950, and concerning a lecture delivered by the petitioner at the ranch. The Government also attached probative weight to the action of the petitioner in executing and filing an Affidavit of Non-Communist Union Officer on October 15, 1949, because of the events surrounding the filing of that affidavit. The Government bridged the gap between October 15, 1949, and July or August 1950 with the testimony of Ford that, during that period, the Party took no disciplinary action against the petitioner for defection or deviation, and did not replace the petitioner in the Party office which Ford testified the petitioner held as a member of the Party State Board.\n\nThe first alleged Party activity of the petitioner preceded his union employment. A witness, who was a Party member in the spring of 1946, testified that, at that time, he and the petitioner were present at a closed Party meeting at the home of the Party chairman for Colorado, where the petitioner, a veteran of World War II, led in urging that veterans who were Party members spread out \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 661]\n\u00a0\n into several veterans' organizations and not all join the same one, the better to further Party work.\n\nLater in 1946 the petitioner was employed by the International Union of Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers as business agent for several local unions in the Silver City-Bayard, New Mexico, area. It was testified that one of the petitioner's first acts was to meet with the International Union's then Regional Director for the Southwest, a Communist Party member, and with the Communist Party organizer for the area, to develop plans for organizing a Party group within each of those locals, which later merged to form Amalgamated Local 890 under the petitioner's presidency.\n\nJ. W. Ford was a member of the Communist Party of New Mexico from 1946 to September 1950 and, from 1948, was a member of the State Board and a Party security officer. He said that in 1948 he became a paid undercover agent for the F. B. I.\n7\n and reported regularly upon Party activities and meetings. He testified that the petitioner was also a Party and a State Board member, and he related in detail occurrences at five closed Party meetings which he said the petitioner attended.\n\nAt the first meeting, in August 1948, Ford said the Party members worked out a plan to support the petitioner's candidacy for Congress on the ticket of the Progressive Party. At the second meeting, in February 1949, Ford said that the petitioner and other Communist Party members were appointed delegates to a meeting of the Mexican-American Association in Phoenix, Arizona, to further a Party plan to infiltrate that organization and to use it for the Party's purposes. At the third meeting, in April 1949, Ford said that the Party's state organization \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 662]\n\u00a0\n was completed, and the petitioner was appointed to the State Board and the Party leader in the southern half of the State. At the fourth meeting, in May 1949, Ford said that the petitioner gave a progress report upon his success in recruiting Party members among labor groups, and offered to use Local 890's newspaper, \"The Union Worker,\" which he edited, to support issues of Party interest. At the fifth meeting, in August 1949, Ford said that preparations were made for another meeting later in that month of the Mexican-American Association in Albuquerque, and that the delegates, including the petitioner, were instructed to give vigorous support to the meeting but to take care not to make themselves conspicuous in the proceedings.\n\nFord's duties as a Party security officer were to keep watch on all Party members and to report \"any particular defections from the Communist philosophy or any peculiar actions, statements or associations, which would endanger the security of the Communist Party of the state.\" If any defection reported by a security officer were considered important, the member \"would be called in and would be either severely reprimanded or criticized, or disciplined. If he refused to accept such discipline he would either be suspended or expelled.\" Ford testified that, between August 1949 and September 1950, when Ford ceased his activities with the New Mexico Party, there was no disciplinary action taken against the petitioner and, to his knowledge, the petitioner was not replaced in his position on the State Board of the Communist Party.\n\nThe events leading up to the petitioner's execution and filing, on October 15, 1949, of an Affidavit of Non-Communist Union Officer were testified to by a former International Union representative, a Communist Party member during 1947 to 1949. He said that, about 17 \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 663]\n\u00a0\n months before, in May or June 1948, a meeting of Party members, holding offices in locals of the International Union of Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers, was held in Denver to formulate plans for combatting a movement, led by non-Communists, to secede from the International Union. He said that the Party members, including the petitioner, were informed of Party policy not to sign affidavits required by 9 (h) of the then recently enacted Taft-Hartley Act. There was no testimony that that policy changed before October 15, 1949.\n\nThe affidavit was filed shortly before a C. I. O. convention was scheduled to expel the Mine-Mill International and other unions from its membership. After filing the affidavit, the petitioner and other Local 890 officers published an article in \"The Union Worker\" charging that the contemplated C. I. O. action was part of a program of \"right-wing unions . . . gobbling up chunks of militant unions. . . . Our International Union and its officers have swallowed a lot of guff, a lot of insults. But that is not the point. . . . Now that our Union has signed the phony affidavits we can defend ourselves . . . in case of raids. We do not fear attack from that quarter any longer.\"\n\nMatusow was a member of the Communist Party of New York and was a paid undercover agent for the F. B. I. before he went to New Mexico.\n8\n In July or August 1950, he spent a 10-day vacation on a ranch near Taos, New Mexico, with the petitioner and a number of other people. He testified to several conversations with the petitioner there. He said he twice told the petitioner of his desire to transfer his membership from the New York to the New Mexico Party, and that on both occasions \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 664]\n\u00a0\n the petitioner applauded the idea and told him, \"we can use you out here, we need more active Party members.\" On one of these occasions, Matusow said, the petitioner asked him for suggestions for a lecture the petitioner was preparing for delivery at the ranch, particularly as to what the New York Communists were doing about the Stockholm Peace Appeal. Matusow described to the petitioner a \"do-day\" program adopted in New York when the Party members were doers, not talkers, and performed some activity, such as painting signs around a baseball stadium urging support for the Peace Appeal. He testified that the petitioner showed great interest in the idea and said he might bring it back to his fellow Party members in Silver City.\n\nMatusow testified that the petitioner delivered his planned lecture, informed his audience of the \"do-day\" idea, praised the Soviet Union's disarmament plan, referred to the United States as the aggressor in Korea, and urged all to read the \"Daily People's World,\" identified by Matusow as the \"West Coast Communist Party newspaper.\" Another witness, an expelled member of Amalgamated Local 890, testified that petitioner, during 1950, 1951 and 1952, repeatedly urged at union meetings that the union members read that paper.\n\nMatusow also testified that, in one of their conversations, the petitioner told him of a program he was developing with leaders of the Mexican Miners Union to negotiate simultaneous expiration dates of collective bargaining agreements, to further a joint action of Mexican and American workers to cut off production to slow down the Korean War effort. Matusow also testified that when he told the petitioner that he had joined the Taos Chapter of the Mexican-American Association, the petitioner told him that this was proper Communist work because the Association was key organization, controlled \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 665]\n\u00a0\n by the Party, for Communist activities in New Mexico and that he, the petitioner, was active in the Association in the Silver City area.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nFord and Matusow were subjected to vigorous cross-examination about their employment as informers for the F. B. I. Ford testified that in 1948 he went to the F. B. I. and offered his services, which were accepted. He thereafter regularly submitted reports to the F. B. I., \"sometimes once a week, sometimes once a month, and at various other times; maybe three or four times a week, depending on the number of meetings . . . [he] attended and the distance between the meetings.\" He said that his reports were made immediately following each meeting, while the events were still fresh in his memory. He could not recall, however, which reports were oral and which in writing.\n\nThe petitioner moved \"for an order directing an inspection of reports of the witness Ford to the Federal Bureau of Investigation dealing with each of the meetings which he said that he attended with the defendant Jencks in the years 1948 and 1949.\" The trial judge, without stating reasons, denied the motion.\n\nMatusow, on his cross-examination, testified that he made both oral and written reports to the F. B. I. on events at the ranch, including his conversations with the petitioner. The trial judge, again without reasons, denied the motion to require \"the prosecution to produce in Court the reports submitted to the F. B. I. by this witness [Matusow] concerning matters which he saw or \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 666]\n\u00a0\n heard at the . . . Ranch during the period that he was a guest there . . . .\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government opposed petitioner's motions at the trial upon the sole ground that a preliminary foundation was not laid of inconsistency between the contents of the reports and the testimony of Matusow and Ford. The Court of Appeals rested the affirmance primarily upon that ground.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nBoth the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred. We hold that the petitioner was not required to lay a preliminary foundation of inconsistency, because a sufficient foundation was established by the testimony of Matusow and Ford that their reports were of the events and activities related in their testimony.\n\nThe reliance of the Court of Appeals upon Gordon v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 414\n, is misplaced. It is true that one fact mentioned in this Court's opinion was that the witness admitted that the documents involved contradicted his testimony. However, to say that Gordon held a preliminary showing of inconsistency a prerequisite to an accused's right to the production for inspection of documents in the Government's possession, is to misinterpret the Court's opinion. The necessary essentials of a foundation, emphasized in that opinion, and present \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 667]\n\u00a0\n here, are that \"[t]he demand was for production of . . . specific documents and did not propose any broad or blind fishing expedition among documents possessed by the Government on the chance that something impeaching might turn up. Nor was this a demand for statements taken from persons or informants not offered as witnesses.\" (Emphasis added.) \n344 \nU.S., at 419\n. We reaffirm and re-emphasize these essentials. \"For production purposes, it need only appear that the evidence is relevant, competent, and outside of any exclusionary rule . . . .\" \n344 \nU.S., at 420\n.\n\nThe crucial nature of the testimony of Ford and Matusow to the Government's case is conspicuously apparent. The impeachment of that testimony was singularly important to the petitioner. The value of the reports for impeachment purposes was highlighted by the admissions of both witnesses that they could not remember what reports were oral and what written, and by Matusow's admission: \"I don't recall what I put in my reports two or three years ago, written or oral, I don't know what they were.\"\n\nEvery experienced trial judge and trial lawyer knows the value for impeaching purposes of statements of the witness recording the events before time dulls treacherous memory. Flat contradiction between the witness' testimony and the version of the events given in his reports is not the only test of inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness' trial testimony.\n\nRequiring the accused first to show conflict between the reports and the testimony is actually to deny the accused evidence relevant and material to his defense. The occasion for determining a conflict cannot arise until \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 668]\n\u00a0\n after the witness has testified, and unless he admits conflict, as in Gordon, the accused is helpless to know or discover conflict without inspecting the reports.\n12\n A requirement of a showing of conflict would be clearly incompatible with our standards for the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts and must therefore be rejected. For the interest of the United States in a criminal prosecution \". . . is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. . . .\" Berger v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 78, 88\n.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThis Court held in Goldman v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 129, 132\n, that the trial judge had discretion to deny inspection when the witness \". . . does not use his notes or memoranda [relating to his testimony] in court . . . .\" We now hold that the petitioner was entitled to an order directing the Government to produce for inspection all reports of Matusow and Ford in its possession, written and, when orally made, as recorded by the F. B. I., touching the events and activities as to which they testified at the trial. We hold, further, that the petitioner is entitled to inspect the reports to decide whether to use them in his defense. Because only the defense is adequately equipped to determine the effective use for \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 669]\n\u00a0\n purpose of discrediting the Government's witness and thereby furthering the accused's defense, the defense must initially be entitled to see them to determine what use may be made of them. Justice requires no less.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nThe practice of producing government documents to the trial judge for his determination of relevancy and materiality, without hearing the accused, is disapproved.\n15\n Relevancy and materiality for the purposes of production and inspection, with a view to use on cross-examination, are established when the reports are shown to relate to the testimony of the witness. Only after inspection of the reports by the accused, must the trial judge determine admissibility - e. g., evidentiary questions of inconsistency, materiality and relevancy - of the contents and the method to be employed for the elimination of parts immaterial or irrelevant. See Gordon v. United States, \n344 \nU.S., at 418\n.\n\nIn the courts below the Government did not assert that the reports were privileged against disclosure on grounds of national security, confidential character of the reports, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 670]\n\u00a0\n public interest or otherwise. In its brief in this Court, however, the Government argues that, absent a showing of contradiction, \"[t]he rule urged by petitioner . . . disregards the legitimate interest that each party - including the Government - has in safeguarding the privacy of its files, particularly where the documents in question were obtained in confidence. Production of such documents, even to a court, should not be compelled in the absence of a preliminary showing by the party making the request.\" The petitioner's counsel, believing that Court of Appeals' decisions imposed such a qualification, restricted his motions to a request for production of the reports to the trial judge for the judge's inspection and determination whether and to what extent the reports should be made available to the petitioner.\n\nIt is unquestionably true that the protection of vital national interests may militate against public disclosure of documents in the Government's possession. This has been recognized in decisions of this Court in civil causes where the Court has considered the statutory authority conferred upon the departments of Government to adopt regulations \"not inconsistent with law, for . . . use . . . of the records, papers . . . appertaining\" to his department.\n16\n The Attorney General has adopted regulations pursuant to this authority declaring all Justice Department records confidential and that no disclosure, including disclosure in response to subpoena, may be made without his permission.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nBut this Court has noticed, in United States v. Reynolds, \n345 \nU.S. 1\n, the holdings of the Court of Appeals \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 671]\n\u00a0\n for the Second Circuit\n18\n that, in criminal causes \". . . the Government can invoke its evidentiary privileges only at the price of letting the defendant go free. The rationale of the criminal cases is that, since the Government which prosecutes an accused also has the duty to see that justice is done, it is unconscionable to allow it to undertake prosecution and then invoke its governmental privileges to deprive the accused of anything which might be material to his defense. . . .\" \n345 \nU.S., at 12\n.\n\nIn United States v. Andolschek, 142 F.2d 503, 506, Judge Learned Hand said:\n\n \". . . While we must accept it as lawful for a department of the government to suppress documents, even when they will help determine controversies between third persons, we cannot agree that this should include their suppression in a criminal prosecution, founded upon those very dealings to which the documents relate, and whose criminality they will, or may, tend to exculpate. So far as they directly touch the criminal dealings, the prosecution necessarily ends any confidential character the documents may possess; it must be conducted in the open, and will lay bare their subject matter. The government must choose; either it must leave the transactions in the obscurity from which a trial will draw them, or it must expose them fully. Nor does it seem to us possible to draw any line between documents whose contents bears directly upon the criminal transactions, and those which may be only indirectly relevant. Not only would such a distinction be extremely difficult to apply in practice, but the same reasons which forbid suppression in one case forbid it in the other, though not, perhaps, quite so imperatively. . . .\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 672]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n We hold that the criminal action must be dismissed when the Government, on the ground of privilege, elects not to comply with an order to produce, for the accused's inspection and for admission in evidence, relevant statements or reports in its possession of government witnesses touching the subject matter of their testimony at the trial. Accord, Roviaro v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 53, 60\n-61. The burden is the Government's not to be shifted to the trial judge, to decide whether the public prejudice of allowing the crime to go unpunished is greater than that attendant upon the possible disclosure of state secrets and other confidential information in the Government's possession.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins the opinion of the Court, but deeming that the questions relating to the instructions to the jury should be dealt with, since a new trial has been directed, he agrees with the respects in which, and the reasons for which, MR. JUSTICE BURTON finds them erroneous.\n\nMR.

JUSTICE HARLAN joins, concurring in the result.\n\nBecause of the importance of this case to the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts, I believe it appropriate to set forth briefly the different route by which I reach the same result as does the Court.\n\nFord and Matusow, as the Court's opinion indicates, were crucial government witnesses because their testimony supplied the principal evidence relating to the period immediately surrounding the filing of petitioner's allegedly false affidavit. Cross-examination brought out \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 673]\n\u00a0\n the fact that each had made oral or written reports to the Federal Bureau of Investigation relating to the respective events about which each had testified on direct examination. Having established that fact, petitioner sought an order requiring the Government to produce, for inspection by the court, the reports relating to those matters about which each witness had testified. The procedure to be followed was carefully specified: the court was to determine whether the reports had evidentiary value for impeachment of the credibility of Ford or Matusow; if the court found that they had value for that purpose, it was then to make them available to petitioner for his use in cross-examination. The Government opposed each motion on the ground that no showing of contradiction between the witness' testimony and his reports had been made as required by a controlling Fifth Circuit decision, Shelton v. United States, 205 F.2d 806. Apparently on that ground, the trial court denied the motions.\n\nPetitioner's requests were limited to a narrow category of reports dealing with specified meetings and conversations. The purpose of the requests - to impeach the credibility of crucial government witnesses - was made clear. Petitioner did not ask to inspect the documents himself; he sought access only to those portions of the reports which the trial court might determine to have evidentiary value for impeachment purposes, and to be unprivileged.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 674]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI agree that, under such circumstances, it was unnecessary for petitioner to show that Ford's and Matusow's trial testimony was contradicted in some respect by their contemporaneous reports. Although some federal courts have required a showing of contradiction,\n2\n this Court never has done so.\n3\n A rule requiring a showing of contradiction in every case would not serve the ends of justice. I concur, therefore, in that portion of the Court's opinion holding that petitioner laid a sufficient foundation for the production of the reports.\n\nI would not, however, replace the inflexible and narrow rule adopted by the courts below with the broader, but equally rigid rule announced by the Court. In matters relating to the production of evidence or the scope of cross-examination, a \"large discretion must be allowed the trial judge.\" Goldman v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 129, 132\n; Glasser v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 60, 83\n; Alford v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 687, 694\n. The appropriate determination of a motion to produce reports made in connection with the examination of a witness depends upon the significance of the facts sought to be established, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 675]\n\u00a0\n and upon the potential use of the requested document in proving those facts. Since that determination depends on \"numerous and subtle considerations difficult to detect or appraise from a cold record . . .,\" the trial court's discretion should be upheld in the absence of a \"clear showing of prejudicial abuse of discretion . . . .\" Cf. Michelson v. United States, \n335 \nU.S. 469, 480\n. We have so held even when the documents sought to be produced have been used at the trial for the purpose of refreshing a witness' recollection. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150, 232\n-234. When the documents have not been so used and are sought only to impeach the credibility of adverse witnesses, and not to prove the facts stated therein, the same conclusion is even more compelling.\n\nThe Court goes beyond the request of petitioner that reports be produced for examination by the trial court and, in effect, seems to hold that the Government waives any privileges it may have with respect to documents in its possession by placing the author of those documents on the witness stand in a criminal prosecution. The Government's privileges with respect to state secrets and the identity of confidential informants embody important considerations of public policy. They are peculiar privileges in that they require the withholding of evidence not only from the jury, but also from the defendant. See Roviaro v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 53\n (identity of informers); Reynolds v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 1\n (state secrets). Once the defendant learns the state secret or the identity of the informer, the underlying basis for the privilege disappears, and there usually remains little need to conceal the privileged evidence from the jury. Thus, when the Government is a party, the preservation of these privileges is dependent upon nondisclosure of the privileged evidence to the defendant. This makes it \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 676]\n\u00a0\n necessary for the trial court, before disclosing the privileged material to the defendant, to pass on the question by examining in camera the portions claimed to be privileged. Cf. Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 214, 221\n. There is nothing novel or unfair about such a procedure. According to Wigmore, it is customary.\n\n\". . . it is obviously not for the witness to withhold the documents upon his mere assertion that they are not relevant or that they are privileged. The question of Relevancy is never one for the witness to concern himself with; nor is the applicability of a privilege to be left to his decision. It is his duty to bring what the Court requires; and the Court can then to its own satisfaction determine by inspection whether the documents produced are irrelevant or privileged. This does not deprive the witness of any rights of privacy, since the Court's determination is made by its own inspection, without submitting the documents to the opponent's view . . . .\" (Emphasis deleted and supplied.) VIII Wigmore. Evidence (3d ed. 1940), 117-118.\n\n\n Numerous federal decisions have followed this practice with respect to the type of documents here involved - contemporaneous reports made by a government investigator or informer who later testifies at the trial.\n4\n This procedure protects the legitimate public interest in safeguarding executive files. It also respects the interests of justice by permitting an accused to receive all information \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 677]\n\u00a0\n necessary to his defense. The accused is given an opportunity to argue that the privilege asserted by the Government is inapplicable and that, even if applicable, his need for the evidence, under the circumstances of the case, outweighs the Government's interest in maintaining secrecy. The problem is closely related to that involved in Roviaro v. United States, supra, dealing with the necessity of the disclosure of an informer's identity in a criminal case. There this Court said:\n\n \"[N]o fixed rule with respect to disclosure is justifiable. The problem is one that calls for balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual's right to prepare his defense. Whether a proper balance renders non-disclosure erroneous must depend on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer's testimony, and other relevant factors.\" \n353 \nU.S., at 62\n.\n\n\n The trial judge exercise his discretion with knowledge of the issues involved in the case, the nature and importance of the Government's interest in maintaining secrecy, and the defendant's need for disclosure. By vesting this discretion in the trial judge, the conflicting interests are balanced, and a just decision is reached in the individual case without needless sacrifice of important public interest.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 678]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI also disagree with the Court's holding that the failure to produce the records to petitioner necessitates a new trial. Petitioner requested only that the records be produced to the trial court.\n6\n He is entitled to no more. Whether a new trial is required should depend on the contents of the requested reports. If the reports contain material that the trial court finds has evidentiary value to petitioner, a new trial should be granted in order that petitioner may use it. But if the reports do not contain contradictory or exculpatory material helpful to petitioner, no possible prejudice could have resulted from the trial court's denials of petitioner's motions.\n7\n Were it not for the fact that I believe the trial court committed reversible error in instructing the jury with respect to the meaning of membership and affiliation, I would vacate the judgment below and remand to the trial court with instructions to examine the reports and to determine, in the light of the entire record, whether the failure to produce the reports was prejudicial to petitioner.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, I believe the trial court failed to give the jury sufficient guidance with respect to the meaning of the phrases \"member of the Communist Party,\" and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 679]\n\u00a0\n \"affiliated with such party\" as they are used in 9 (h) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 61 Stat. 146, 29 U.S.C. 159 (h). The instruction given as to membership was as follows:\n\n \"In considering whether or not the defendant was a member of the Communist Party, you may consider circumstantial evidence, as well as direct. You may consider whether or not he attended Communist Party meetings, whether or not he held an office in the Communist Party, whether or not he engaged in other conduct consistent only with membership in the Communist Party and all other evidence, either direct or circumstantial, which bears or may bear upon the question of whether or not he was a member of the Communist Party on April 28, 1950.\"\n\n\n This instruction failed to emphasize to the jury the essential element of membership in an organized group - the desire of an individual to belong to the organization and a recognition by the organization that it considers him as a member.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThe instruction on affiliation also was defective. After quoting dictionary definitions employing synonymous words, the trial court merely said: \"Affiliation . . . means something less than membership but more than sympathy. Affiliation with the Communist Party may be proved by either circumstantial or direct evidence, or both.\" This instruction allowed the jury to convict petitioner on the basis of acts of intermittent cooperation. It did not require a continuing course of conduct \"on a fairly permanent basis\" \"that could not be abruptly ended without \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 680]\n\u00a0\n giving at least reasonable cause for the charge of a breach of good faith.\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\nBecause of these errors in the instructions, petitioner is entitled to a new trial. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In his brief, petitioner states:\n\n\"Petitioner asked only that the reports be produced to the trial judge so that he could examine them and determine whether they had evidentiary value for impeachment purposes. Petitioner sought access only to those portions of the reports having this value. The motion therefore proposed no broad foray into the government's files and afforded the judge every opportunity to protect the government's legitimate privilege as to the matters not connected with this case.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Scanlon v.

United States, \n344 \nU.S. 414\n, the petitioners had shown that written statements given to government agents by a key government witness contradicted the witness' trial testimony. In holding that the trial court erred in denying petitioners' motion for the production and inspection of these statements, the Court was deciding that case on its facts. I do not regard it as establishing a rule that a showing of contradiction is an essential element of the foundation precedent to production.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See, e. g., United States v. Coplon, 185 F.2d 629, 638; United States v. Beekman, 155 F.2d 580, 584; United States v. Cohen, 145 F.2d 82, 92; United States v. Krulewitch, 145 F.2d 76, 79; United States v. Flynn, 130 F. Supp. 412; United States v. Mesarosh, 116 F. Supp. 345, 350; United States v. Schneiderman, 106 F. Supp. 731, 735-738.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Privileged material sometimes can be excised from the reports without destroying their value to the defendant. Only when deletion is impracticable is the court compelled to choose between disclosing the document as a whole and withholding it completely. Material withheld from the defendant should be sealed as part of the record so that an appellate court may review the action of the trial court and correct any abuse of discretion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See n. 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:\n\n\"Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\" See Lutwak v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 604, 619\n; Kotteakos v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 750, 756\n-777. There are many cases in which non production of documents has been held to be harmless error. Three comparatively recent cases, dealing with reports of law-enforcement officers are United States v. Sansone, 231 F.2d 887; Montgomery v. United States, 203 F.2d 887, 893-894; and Bundy v. United States. 90 U.S. App. D.C. 12, 193 F.2d 694.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The trial court is the appropriate forum to consider the possible prejudicial effect of the error.

JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nThe Court holds \"that the criminal action must be dismissed when the Government, on the ground of privilege, elects not to comply with an order to produce, for the accused's inspection and for admission in evidence, relevant statements or reports in its possession of government witnesses touching the subject matter of their testimony at the trial.\" This fashions a new rule of evidence which is foreign to our federal jurisprudence. The rule has always been to the contrary. It seems to me that proper judicial administration would require that the Court expressly overrule Goldman v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 129, 132\n (1942), which is contra to the rule announced today. But that is not done. That case is left on the books to haunt lawyers and trial courts in their search for the proper rule. In Goldman the Court was unanimous on the issue of disclosure of documents\n1\n and refused to order produced \"notes and memoranda made by the [federal] agents during the investigation.\" The rule announced today has no support in any of our cases.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 681]\n\u00a0\n Every federal judge and every lawyer of federal experience knows that it is not the present rule. Even the defense attorneys did not have the temerity to ask for such a sweeping decision. They only asked that the documents be delivered to the judge for his determination of whether the defendant should be permitted to examine them. This is the procedure followed in some of our circuits. My Brother BURTON has clearly stated in his concurring opinion the manner in which this procedure works. Perhaps here with a recanting witness the trial judge should have examined the specific documents called for, as the defense requested, and if he thought justice required their delivery to the defense, order such delivery to be made. I would have no objection to this being done. But as Brother BURTON points out, this would not require a reversal but merely a vacation of the judgment and a remand to the trial court for that purpose.\n\nUnless the Congress changes the rule announced by the Court today, those intelligence agencies of our Government engaged in law enforcement may as well close up shop, for the Court has opened their files to the criminal and thus afforded him a Roman holiday for rummaging \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 682]\n\u00a0\n through confidential information as well as vital national secrets. This may well be a reasonable rule in state prosecutions where none of the problems of foreign relations, espionage, sabotage, subversive activities, counterfeiting, internal security, national defense, and the like exist, but any person conversant with federal government activities and problems will quickly recognize that it opens up a veritable Pandora's box of troubles. And all in the name of justice. For over eight score years now our federal judicial administration has gotten along without it and today that administration enjoys the highest rank in the world.\n\nDirector J. Edgar Hoover back in 1950 tellingly pointed this out before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate. Among other things he said, \"I have always maintained the view that if we were to fully discharge the serious responsibilities imposed upon us, the confidential character of our files must be inviolate. . . . [U]nless we drastically change or circumscribe our procedures, they should not be disclosed.\" In describing the files of the Bureau, he continued:\n\n \"FBI reports set forth all details secured from a witness. If those details were disclosed, they could become subject to misinterpretation, they could be quoted out of context, or they could be used to thwart truth, distort half-truths, and misrepresent facts. The raw material, the allegations, the details of associations, and compilation of information . . . are of value to an investigator in the discharge of his duty. These files were never intended to be used in any other manner and the public interest would not be served by the disclosure of their contents.\"\n\n\n \"These files contain complaints, allegations, facts, and statements of all persons interviewed. Depending upon the purpose of the investigation, particularly \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 683]\n\u00a0\n in security cases, they contain, not only background data on the individual but details of his private life . . . the identities of our confidential sources of information and full details of investigative techniques. In short, they consist of a running account of all that transpires.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . For want of a more apt comparison, our files can be compared to the notes of a newspaper reporter before he has culled through the printable material from the unprintable. The files do not consist of proven information alone. . . . One report may allege crimes of a most despicable type, and the truth or falsity of these charges may not emerge until several reports are studied, further investigation made, and the wheat separated from the chaff.\"\n\n\n\"If spread upon the record, criminals, foreign agents, subversives, and others would be forewarned and would seek methods to carry out their activities by avoiding detection and thus defeat the very purposes for which the FBI was created.\" Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on S. Res. 231, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 327-329.\n\n\n I can add nothing to this graphic expression of the necessity for the existence of the rule which, until today, kept inviolate investigative reports.\n\nMy Brother BURTON'S concurrence also points up the failure of the majority to pass upon another important question involved, namely, the sufficiency of the trial judge's instructions. The impact of this failure on him and on my Brother FRANKFURTER was such that they have announced their own views though the majority never reaches the point. For myself alone, I believe that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 684]\n\u00a0\n the instructions on the whole were sufficient. It is unfortunate that the majority does not announce its position. This is only one of some 10 Communist affidavit cases now pending in the trial and appellate courts. Unless this case goes as did Gold's,\n3\n the question of the sufficiency of instructions will come up in this as well as in each of the other cases. The Court is sorely divided on this important issue and proper judicial administration requires that charges as to what constitutes membership and affiliation in the Communist Party be announced.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Though the Court was divided on an issue not here material, the two dissenting opinions expressed no disagreement whatsoever on the disclosure issue.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The opinion cites only two of our cases for support. The quotations from Gordon v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 414\n (1953), an opinion by my late Brother Jackson, a former Solicitor General and Attorney General, are lifted entirely out of context. The case holds explicitly \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 681]\n\u00a0\n that documents must be produced only after a foundation is laid \"showing that the documents were in existence, were in possession of the Government, were made by the Government's witness under examination, were contradictory of his present testimony, and that the contradiction was as to relevant, important and material matters which directly bore on the main issue being tried: the participation of the accused in the crime.\" Id., at 418-419. Likewise, United States v. Reynolds, \n345 \nU.S. 1\n (1953), by my late Brother Chief Justice Vinson, approved the refusal of the Government to produce documents in a tort claims suit. The opinion gave no approval whatever to the conclusion announced by the majority here. I purposely omitted the reference in the opinion after the penultimate sentence, \"Accord, Roviaro v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 53, 60\n-61.\" That case had to do with the disclosure of a dead informant's name and did not touch on the problem of the disclosure of government documents.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In Gold v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 985\n (1957), this Court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial because of official intrusion into the privacy of the jury. The case was dismissed on oral motion of the Government on May 9, 1957. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 657, 685]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHNSON v. UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 531\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1957\n\n\n\n\n1. \nUnder 28 U.S.C. 1915, which provides that an appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies that it is not taken in good faith, a convicted defendant is not barred from showing that such a certification was unwarranted and that an appeal should be allowed. Pp. 565-566.\n\n2. \nAlthough a certification by a District Court under 28 U.S.C. 1915 that an appeal is not taken in good faith carries great weight, it is the duty of a Court of Appeals, upon a proper showing, to set such a certification aside. P. 566.\n\n3. \nTo a convicted defendant who challenges a trial court's certification under 28 U.S.C. 1915, a Court of Appeals must afford the aid of counsel unless he insists on being his own; and either the defendant or assigned counsel must be enabled to show that the grounds for seeking an appeal are not frivolous and do not justify the finding that the appeal is not sought in good faith. P. 566.\n\n4. \nAlthough it is not required in every such case that the United States must furnish the defendant with a stenographic transcript of the trial, it is essential that he be assured some appropriate means of making manifest the basis of his claim that the trial court's certification was unwarranted.

Timbers for petitioner.\n\nSolicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney and Beatrice Rosenberg for the United States.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe petition for writ of certiorari is granted, as is leave to proceed in forma pauperis.\n\nBy the Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 866, as now enlarged in 28 U.S.C. 1915, Congress provided for proceedings \n\n[352 \nU.S. 565, 566]\n\u00a0\n in forma pauperis on appeal unless \"the trial court certifies in writing that it [the appeal] is not taken in good faith.\" Such certification is not final in the sense that the convicted defendant is barred from showing that it was unwarranted and that an appeal should be allowed. Of course, certification by the judge presiding at the trial carries great weight but, necessarily, it cannot be conclusive. Upon a proper showing a Court of Appeals has a duty to displace a District Court's certification. Moreover, a Court of Appeals must, under Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458\n, afford one who challenges that certification the aid of counsel unless he insists on being his own. Finally, either the defendant or his assigned counsel must be enabled to show that the grounds for seeking an appeal from the judgment of conviction are not frivolous and do not justify the finding that the appeal is not sought in good faith. This does not require that in every such case the United States must furnish the defendant with a stenographic transcript of the trial. It is essential, however, that he be assured some appropriate means - such as the district judge's notes or an agreed statement by trial counsel - of making manifest the basis of his claim that the District Court committed error in certifying that the desired appeal was not pursued in good faith. See Miller v. United States, \n317 \nU.S. 192, 198\n.\n\nSince here the Court of Appeals did not assign counsel to assist petitioner in prosecuting his application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis and since it does not appear that the Court of Appeals assured petitioner adequate means of presenting it with a fair basis for determining whether the District Court's certification was warranted, the judgment below must be vacated and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n      So ordered. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 565, 567]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKINGSLEY BOOKS, INC. v.

Lefkowitz, Attorney General, John R. Davison, Solicitor General, and Ruth Kessler Toch, Assistant Attorney General, filed a brief for the State of New York, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a proceeding under 22-a of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure (L. 1941, c. 925), as amended in 1954 (L. 1954, c. 702). This section supplements the existing conventional criminal provision dealing with pornography by authorizing the chief executive, or legal officer, of a municipality to invoke a \"limited injunctive remedy,\" under closely defined procedural safeguards, against the sale and distribution of written and printed matter found after due trial to be obscene, and to obtain an order for the seizure, in default of surrender, of the condemned publications.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 438]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA complaint dated September 10, 1954, charged appellants with displaying for sale paper-covered obscene booklets, fourteen of which were annexed, under the general title of \"Nights of Horror.\" The complaint prayed \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 439]\n\u00a0\n that appellants be enjoined from further distribution of the booklets, that they be required to surrender to the sheriff for destruction all copies in their possession, and, upon failure to do so, that the sheriff be commanded to seize and destroy those copies. The same day the appellants were ordered to show cause within four days why they should not be enjoined pendente lite from distributing the booklets. Appellants consented to the granting of an injunction pendente lite and did not bring the matter to issue promptly, as was their right under subdivision 2 of the challenged section, which provides that the persons sought to be enjoined \"shall be entitled to a trial of the issues within one day after joinder of issue and a decision shall be rendered by the court within two days of the conclusion of the trial.\" After the case came to trial, the judge, sitting in equity, found that the booklets annexed to the complaint and introduced in evidence were clearly obscene - were \"dirt for dirt's sake\"; he enjoined their further distribution and ordered their destruction. He refused to enjoin \"the sale and distribution of later issues\" on the ground that \"to rule against a volume not offered in evidence would . . . impose an unreasonable prior restraint upon freedom of the press.\" 208 Misc. 150, 167, 142 N. Y. S. 2d 735, 750.\n\nNot challenging the construction of the statute or the finding of obscenity, appellants took a direct appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, a proceeding in which the constitutionality of the statute was the sole question open to them. That court (one judge not sitting) found no constitutional infirmity: three judges supported the unanimous conclusion by detailed discussion, the other three deemed a brief disposition justified by \"ample authority.\" 1 N. Y. 2d 177, 189, 134 N. E. 2d 461, 468. A claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment made throughout the state litigation brought the case here on appeal. \n352 \nU.S. 962\n. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 440]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNeither in the New York Court of Appeals, nor here, did appellants assail the legislation insofar as it outlaws obscenity. The claim they make lies within a very narrow compass. Their attack is upon the power of New York to employ the remedial scheme of 22-a. Authorization of an injunction pendente lite, as part of this scheme, during the period within which the issue of obscenity must be promptly tried and adjudicated in an adversary proceeding for which \"[a]dequate notice, judicial hearing, [and] fair determination\" are assured, 208 Misc. 150, 164, 142 N. Y. S. 2d 735, 747, is a safeguard against frustration of the public interest in effectuating judicial condemnation of obscene matter. It is a brake on the temptation to exploit a filthy business offered by the limited hazards of piecemeal prosecutions, sale by sale, of a publication already condemned as obscene. New York enacted this procedure on the basis of study by a joint legislative committee. Resort to this injunctive remedy, it is claimed, is beyond the constitutional power of New York in that it amounts to a prior censorship of literary product and as such is violative of that \"freedom of thought, and speech\" which has been \"withdrawn by the Fourteenth Amendment from encroachment by the states.\" Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 326\n-327. Reliance is particularly placed upon Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697\n.\n\nIn an unbroken series of cases extending over a long stretch of this Court's history, it has been accepted as a postulate that \"the primary requirements of decency may be enforced against obscene publications.\" Id., at 716. And so our starting point is that New York can constitutionally convict appellants of keeping for sale the booklets incontestably found to be obscene. Alberts v. California, post, p. 476, decided this day. The immediate problem then is whether New York can adopt as an \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 441]\n\u00a0\n auxiliary means of dealing with such obscene merchandising the procedure of 22-a.\n\nWe need not linger over the suggestion that something can be drawn out of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment that restricts New York to the criminal process in seeking to protect its people against the dissemination of pornography. It is not for this Court thus to limit the State in resorting to various weapons in the armory of the law. Whether proscribed conduct is to be visited by a criminal prosecution or by a qui tam action or by an injunction or by some or all of these remedies in combination, is a matter within the legislature's range of choice. See Tigner v. Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 141, 148\n. If New York chooses to subject persons who disseminate obscene \"literature\" to criminal prosecution and also to deal with such books as deodands of old, or both, with due regard, of course, to appropriate opportunities for the trial of the underlying issue, it is not for us to gainsay its selection of remedies. Just as Near v. Minnesota, supra, one of the landmark opinions in shaping the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and of the press, left no doubts that \"Liberty of speech, and of the press, is also not an absolute right,\" \n283 \nU.S., at 708\n, it likewise made clear that \"the protection even as to previous restraint is not absolutely unlimited.\" Id., at 716. To be sure, the limitation is the exception; it is to be closely confined so as to preclude what may fairly be deemed licensing or censorship.\n\nThe judicial angle of vision in testing the validity of a statute like 22-a is \"the operation and effect of the statute in substance.\" Id., at 713. The phrase \"prior restraint\" is not a self-wielding sword. Nor can it serve as a talismanic test. The duty of closer analysis and critical judgment in applying the thought behind the phrase has thus been authoritatively put by one who \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 442]\n\u00a0\n brings weighty learning to his support of constitutionally protected liberties: \"What is needed,\" writes Professor Paul A. Freund, \"is a pragmatic assessment of its operation in the particular circumstances. The generalization that prior restraint is particularly obnoxious in civil liberties cases must yield to more particularistic analysis.\" The Supreme Court and Civil Liberties, 4 Vand. L. Rev. 533, 539.\n\nWherein does 22-a differ in its effective operation from the type of statute upheld in Alberts? Section 311 of California's Penal Code provides that \"Every person who wilfully and lewdly . . . keeps for sale . . . any obscene . . . book . . . is guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\" Section 1141 of New York's Penal Law is similar. One would be bold to assert that the in terrorem effect of such statutes less restrains booksellers in the period before the law strikes than does 22-a. Instead of requiring the bookseller to dread that the offer for sale of a book may, without prior warning, subject him to a criminal prosecution with the hazard of imprisonment, the civil procedure assures him that such consequences cannot follow unless he ignores a court order specifically directed to him for a prompt and carefully circumscribed determination of the issue of obscenity. Until then, he may keep the book for sale and sell it on his own judgment rather than steer \"nervously among the treacherous shoals.\" Warburg, Onward And Upward With The Arts, The New Yorker, April 20, 1957, 98, 101, in connection with R. v. Martin Secker Warburg, Ltd., 1954. 2 All Eng. 683 (C. C. C.).\n\nCriminal enforcement and the proceeding under 22-a interfere with a book's solicitation of the public precisely at the same stage. In each situation the law moves after publication; the book need not in either case have yet passed into the hands of the public. The Alberts record does not show that the matter there found to be \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 443]\n\u00a0\n obscene had reached the public at the time that the criminal charge of keeping such matter for sale was lodged, while here as a matter of fact copies of the booklets whose distribution was enjoined had been on sale for several weeks when process was served. In each case the bookseller is put on notice by the complaint that sale of the publication charged with obscenity in the period before trial may subject him to penal consequences. In the one case he may suffer fine and imprisonment for violation of the criminal statute, in the other, for disobedience of the temporary injunction. The bookseller may of course stand his ground and confidently believe that in any judicial proceeding the book could not be condemned as obscene, but both modes of procedure provide an effective deterrent against distribution prior to adjudication of the book's content - the threat of subsequent penalization.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe method devised by New York in 22-a for determining whether a publication is obscene does not differ in essential procedural safeguards from that provided under many state statutes making the distribution of obscene publications a misdemeanor. For example, while the New York criminal provision brings the State's criminal procedure into operation, a defendant is not thereby entitled to a jury trial. In each case a judge is the conventional trier of fact; in each, a jury may as a matter of discretion be summoned. Compare N. Y. City Criminal Courts Act, 31, Sub. 1 (c) and Sub. 4, with N. Y. Civil Practice Act, 430. (Appellants, as a matter of fact, did not request a jury trial, they did not attack \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 444]\n\u00a0\n the statute in the courts below for failure to require a jury, and they did not bring that issue to this Court.) Of course, the Due Process Clause does not subject the States to the necessity of having trial by jury in misdemeanor prosecutions.\n\nNor are the consequences of a judicial condemnation for obscenity under 22-a more restrictive of freedom of expression than the result of conviction for a misdemeanor. In Alberts, the defendant was fined $500, sentenced to sixty days in prison, and put on probation for two years on condition that he not violate the obscenity statute. Not only was he completely separated from society for two months but he was also seriously restrained from trafficking in all obscene publications for a considerable time. Appellants, on the other hand, were enjoined from displaying for sale or distributing only the particular booklets theretofore published and adjudged to be obscene. Thus, the restraint upon appellants as merchants in obscenity was narrower than that imposed on Alberts.\n\nSection 22-a's provision for the seizure and destruction of the instruments of ascertained wrongdoing expresses resort to a legal remedy sanctioned by the long history of Anglo-American law. See Holmes, The Common Law, 24-26; Van Oster v. Kansas, \n272 \nU.S. 465\n; Goldsmith-Grant Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 505, 510\n-511; Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133\n; and see United States v. Urbuteit, \n335 \nU.S. 355\n, dealing with misbranded articles under 304 (a) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1044. It is worth noting that although the Alberts record does not reveal whether the publications found to be obscene were destroyed, provision is made for that by 313 and 314 of the California Penal Code. Similarly, 1144 of New York's Penal Law provides for destruction of obscene matter following conviction for its dissemination. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 445]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt only remains to say that the difference between Near v. Minnesota, supra, and this case is glaring in fact. The two cases are no less glaringly different when judged by the appropriate criteria of constitutional law. Minnesota empowered its courts to enjoin the dissemination of future issues of a publication because its past issues had been found offensive. In the language of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, \"This is of the essence of censorship.\" \n283 \nU.S., at 713\n. As such, it was found unconstitutional. This was enough to condemn the statute wholly apart from the fact that the proceeding in Near involved not obscenity but matters deemed to be derogatory to a public officer. Unlike Near, 22-a is concerned solely with obscenity and, as authoritatively construed, it studiously withholds restraint upon matters not already published and not yet found to be offensive.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \" 22-a. Obscene prints and articles; jurisdiction. The supreme court has jurisdiction to enjoin the sale or distribution of obscene prints and articles, as hereinafter specified: \"1. The chief executive officer of any city, town or village or the corporation counsel, or if there be none, the chief legal officer of any city, town, or village, in which a person, firm or corporation sells or distributes or is about to sell or distribute or has in his possession with intent to sell or distribute or is about to acquire possession with intent to sell or distribute any book, magazine, pamphlet, comic book, story paper, writing, paper, picture, drawing, photograph, figure, image or any written or printed matter of an indecent character, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 438]\n\u00a0\n which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent or disgusting, or which contains an article or instrument of indecent or immoral use or purports to be for indecent or immoral use or purpose; or in any other respect defined in section eleven hundred forty-one of the penal law, may maintain an action for an injunction against such person, firm or corporation in the supreme court to prevent the sale or further sale or the distribution or further distribution or the acquisition or possession of any book, magazine, pamphlet, comic book, story paper, writing, paper, picture, drawing, photograph figure or image or any written or printed matter of an indecent character, herein described or described in section eleven hundred forty-one of the penal law. \"2. The person, firm or corporation sought to be enjoined shall be entitled to a trial of the issues within one day after joinder of issue and a decision shall be rendered by the court within two days of the conclusion of the trial. \"3.

Every person, firm or corporation who sells, distributes, or acquires possession with intent to sell or distribute any of the matter described in paragraph one hereof, after the service upon him of a summons and complaint in an action brought by such officer of any city, town or village pursuant to this section is chargeable with knowledge of the contents thereof.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This comparison of remedies takes note of the fact that we do not have before us a case where, although the issue of obscenity is ultimately decided in favor of the bookseller, the State nevertheless attempts to punish him for disobedience of the interim injunction. For all we know, New York may impliedly condition the temporary injunction so as not to subject the bookseller to a charge of contempt if he prevails on the issue of obscenity.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, dissenting.\n\nMy views on the right of a State to protect its people against the purveyance of obscenity were expressed in Alberts v. California, post, p. 476, also decided today. Here we have an entirely different situation.\n\nThis is not a criminal obscenity case. Nor is it a case ordering the destruction of materials disseminated by a person who has been convicted of an offense for doing so, as would be authorized under provisions in the laws of New York and other States. It is a case wherein the New York police, under a different state statute, located books which, in their opinion, were unfit for public use because of obscenity and then obtained a court order for their condemnation and destruction.\n\nThe majority opinion sanctions this proceeding. I would not. Unlike the criminal cases decided today, this New York law places the book on trial. There is totally \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 446]\n\u00a0\n lacking any standard in the statute for judging the book in context. The personal element basic to the criminal laws is entirely absent. In my judgment, the same object may have wholly different impact depending upon the setting in which it is placed. Under this statute, the setting is irrelevant.\n\nIt is the manner of use that should determine obscenity. It is the conduct of the individual that should be judged, not the quality of art or literature. To do otherwise is to impose a prior restraint and hence to violate the Constitution. Certainly in the absence of a prior judicial determination of illegal use, books, pictures and other objects of expression should not be destroyed. It savors too much of book burning.\n\nI would reverse.\n\nOpinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting, announced by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN.\n\nThere are two reasons why I think this restraining order should be dissolved.\n\nFirst, the provision for an injunction pendente lite gives the State the paralyzing power of a censor. A decree can issue ex parte - without a hearing and without any ruling or finding on the issue of obscenity. This provision is defended on the ground that it is only a little encroachment, that a hearing must be promptly given and a finding of obscenity promptly made. But every publisher knows what awful effect a decree issued in secret can have. We tread here on First Amendment grounds. And nothing is more devastating to the rights that it guarantees than the power to restrain publication before even a hearing is held. This is prior restraint and censorship at its worst.\n\nSecond, the procedure for restraining by equity decree the distribution of all the condemned literature does violence to the First Amendment. The judge or jury which \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 447]\n\u00a0\n finds the publisher guilty in New York City acts on evidence that may be quite different from evidence before the judge or jury that finds the publisher not guilty in Rochester. In New York City the publisher may have been selling his tracts to juveniles, while in Rochester he may have sold to professional people. The nature of the group among whom the tracts are distributed may have an important bearing on the issue of guilt in any obscenity prosecution. Yet the present statute makes one criminal conviction conclusive and authorizes a state-wide decree that subjects the distributor to the contempt power. I think every publication is a separate offense which entitles the accused to a separate trial. Juries or judges may differ in their opinions, community by community, case by case. The publisher is entitled to that leeway under our constitutional system. One is entitled to defend every utterance on its merits and not to suffer today for what he uttered yesterday. Free speech is not to be regulated like diseased cattle and impure butter. The audience (in this case the judge or the jury) that hissed yesterday may applaud today, even for the same performance.\n\nThe regime approved by the Court goes far toward making the censor supreme. It also substitutes punishment by contempt for punishment by jury trial. In both respects it transgresses constitutional guarantees.\n\nI would reverse this judgment and direct the restraining order to be dissolved.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, dissenting.\n\nI believe the absence in this New York obscenity statute of a right to jury trial is a fatal defect. Provision for jury trials in equity causes is made by 430 of the New York Civil Practice Act,\n1\n but only for discretionary jury trials, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 436, 448]\n\u00a0\n and advisory verdicts, to be followed or rejected by the trial judge as he deems fit and proper.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nIn Alberts v. California and Roth v. United States, decided today, post, p. 476, the Court held to be constitutional the following standard for judging obscenity - whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest. The statutes there involved allowed a jury trial of right, and we did not reach the question whether the safeguards necessary for securing the freedoms of speech and press for material not obscene included a jury determination of obscenity.\n\nThe jury represents a cross-section of the community and has a special aptitude for reflecting the view of the average person. Jury trial of obscenity therefore provides a peculiarly competent application of the standard for judging obscenity which, by its definition, calls for an appraisal of material according to the average person's application of contemporary community standards. A statute which does not afford the defendant, of right, a jury determination of obscenity falls short, in my view, of giving proper effect to the standard fashioned as the necessary safeguard demanded by the freedoms of speech and press for material which is not obscene. Of course, as with jury questions generally, the trial judge must initially determine that there is a jury question, i. e., that reasonable men may differ whether the material is obscene.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nI would reverse the judgment and direct the restraining order to be dissolved.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Gilbert-Bliss' N.

STATE BAR(1957)\nNo. 10\nArgued: January 14, 1957Decided: May 6, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In 1954 the Committee of Bar Examiners of California refused to certify petitioner to practice law in that State, though he had satisfactorily passed the bar examination, on the grounds that he had failed to prove (1) that he was of good moral character, and (2) that he did not advocate forcible overthrow of the Government. He sought review by the State Supreme Court, contending that the Committee's action deprived him of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. The State Supreme Court denied his petition without opinion. Held:\n\n 1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the case, and the constitutional issues are properly here. Pp. 254-258.\n\n\n 2. The evidence in the record does not rationally support the only two grounds upon which the Committee relied in rejecting petitioner's application, and therefore the State's refusal to admit him to the bar was a denial of due process and equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 258-274.\n\n\n  (a) That petitioner was a member of the Communist Party in 1941, if true, does not support an inference that he did not have good moral character, absent any evidence that he ever engaged in or abetted or supported any unlawful or immoral activities. Pp. 266-268.\n\n\n  (b) An inference of bad moral character cannot rationally be drawn from editorials in which petitioner severely criticized, inter alia, this country's participation in the Korean War, the actions and policies of the leaders of the major political parties, the influence of \"big business\" in American life, racial discrimination, and this Court's decisions in Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n, and other cases. Pp. 268-269.\n\n\n  (c) On the record in this case, inferences of bad moral character from petitioner's refusal to answer questions about his political affiliations and opinions are unwarranted. Pp. 269-271.\n\n\n  (d) There is no evidence in the record which rationally justifies a finding that petitioner failed to show that he did not advocate forcible overthrow of the Government. Pp. 271-274.\n\n\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEdward Mosk argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Samuel Rosenwein.\n\nFrank B. Belcher argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was Ralph E. Lewis.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae in support of petitioner were filed by A. L. Wirin for the American Civil Liberties Union, Southern California Branch, and Osmond K. Fraenkel for the National Lawyers Guild.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner, Raphael Konigsberg, graduated from the Law School of the University of Southern California in 1953 and four months later satisfactorily passed the California bar examination. Nevertheless, the State Committee of Bar Examiners, after several hearings, refused to certify him to practice law on the grounds he had failed to prove (1) that he was of good moral character and (2) that he did not advocate overthrow of the Government of the United States or California by unconstitutional means.\n1\n As permitted by state law, Konigsberg asked the California Supreme Court to review the Committee's refusal to give him its certification. He contended that he had satisfactorily proved that he met all the requirements for admission to the bar, and that the Committee's action deprived him of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n The State Supreme Court, without opinion, and with three of its seven justices dissenting, denied his petition for review. We granted certiorari because the constitutional questions presented were substantial. \n351 \nU.S. 936\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nBefore reaching the merits, we must first consider the State's contention that this Court does not have jurisdiction to review the case. The State argues (1) that petitioner did not present his constitutional claims to the California Supreme Court in the manner prescribed by that court's rules, and (2) that the state court's decision not to grant him relief can be attributed to his failure to conform to its procedural rules rather than to a rejection of his constitutional claims.\n\nIn considering actions of the Committee of Bar Examiners the California Supreme Court exercises original jurisdiction and is not restricted to the limited review made by an appellate court. For example, that court declared in In re Lacey, 11 Cal. 2d 699, at 701, 81 P.2d 935, at 936:\n\n \"That this court has the inherent power and authority  to admit an applicant to practice law in this state  or to reinstate an applicant previously disbarred  despite an unfavorable report upon such application  by the Board of Bar Governors of the State Bar, we  think is now well settled in this state. . . . The  recommendation of the Board of Bar Governors  is advisory only . . . . [T]he final determination  in all these matters rests with this court, and its  powers in that regard are plenary and its judgment  conclusive.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The California Supreme Court has a special rule, Rule 59 (b), which governs review of actions of the Bar Examiners.\n3\n Rule 59 (b) requires that a petition for review \"shall specify the grounds relied on and shall be accompanied by petitioner's brief.\" Konigsberg complied with this rule. In his petition for review he specifically charged that the findings of the Committee were not supported by any lawful evidence.\n4\n The petition then went on to assert that the Committee's action, which was based on findings that the petition had previously alleged were not supported by evidence, was an attempt by the State of California in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to deprive him \"of liberty or property without due process of law\" and to deny him \"the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nThroughout the hearings before the Bar Examiners Konigsberg repeatedly objected to questions about his beliefs and associations asserting that such inquiries infringed rights guaranteed him by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. He urged that the Committee would abridge freedom of speech, press and assembly, violate due process, and deny equal protection of the laws if it denied his application because of his \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n political opinions, writings, and affiliations. He asserted that he had affirmatively proved his good moral character and that there was no legal basis for finding that he was morally unfit to practice law. He insisted that in determining whether he was qualified the Committee had to comply with due process of law and cited as supporting his position Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n, and Joint Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath, \n341 \nU.S. 123\n, where this Court condemned arbitrary findings as offensive to due process.\n5\n Since Konigsberg challenged the sufficiency of the evidence in his petition for review, it seems clear that the State Supreme Court examined the entire record of the hearings before the Bar Examiners\n6\n and must have been aware of the constitutional arguments made by Konigsberg during the hearings and the authorities relied on to support these arguments.\n\nThe State contends, however, that it was not enough for Konigsberg to raise his constitutional objections in his petition, in the manner prescribed by Rule 59 (b), and at the hearings. It claims that under California practice the State Supreme Court will not consider a contention unless it is supported by an argument and citation of authorities in a brief submitted by the person seeking review. Because Konigsberg's brief did not repeat, precisely and in detail, the constitutional objections set forth in his petition,\n7\n the argument continues, this Court is compelled to hold that the State Supreme Court could have refused relief to petitioner on a narrow procedural ground. But the California cases cited by the State do not require such a conclusion. It is true that the State \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 257]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court has insisted that on appeal in ordinary civil cases alleged errors should be pointed out clearly and concisely, with reasons why they are erroneous, and with reference to supporting authorities.\n8\n However this case was not reviewed under the rules of appeal which apply to the ordinary civil case but rather under a special rule applying to original proceedings. We are pointed to nothing which indicates that the State Supreme Court has adopted any rule in this type of case which requires that contentions raised in the petition for review must also be set out in the brief. The one case cited, Johnson v. State Bar of California, 4 Cal. 2d 744, 52 P.2d 928, indicates the contrary. In challenging the recommendation of the Board of Governors of the State Bar that he be suspended from the practice of law, Johnson alleged, apparently in an offhand way, that the entire State Bar Act was \"unconstitutional.\" He made no argument and cited no authority to support this bare, sweeping assertion. While the court said that this was an insufficient presentation of the issue it nevertheless went ahead to consider and reject Johnson's argument and to hold the Act constitutional.\n\nCounsel for California concedes that the state courts in criminal cases often pass on issues ineptly argued in a defendant's brief or sometimes not raised there at all.\n9\n As counsel states, the reasons for relaxing this standard in criminal cases are obvious - such cases may involve forfeiture of the accused's property, liberty, or life. While this is not a criminal case, its consequences for Konigsberg take it out of the ordinary run of civil cases. The Committee's action prevents him from earning \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 258]\n\u00a0\n a living by practicing law. This deprivation has grave consequences for a man who has spent years of study and a great deal of money in preparing to be a lawyer.\n\nIn view of the grounds relied on in Konigsberg's petition for review, his repeated assertions throughout the hearings of various federal constitutional rights, and the practices of the California Supreme Court, we cannot conclude that that court, with three of its seven justices dissenting, intended to uphold petitioner's exclusion from the practice of law because his lawyer failed to elaborate in his brief the constitutional claims set forth in his petition for review and in the record of the hearings. Our conclusion is that the constitutional issues are before us and we must consider them.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe now turn to the merits. In passing on Konigsberg's application, the Committee of Bar Examiners conducted a series of hearings. At these hearings Konigsberg was questioned at great length about his political affiliations and beliefs. Practically all of these questions were directed at finding out whether he was or ever had been a member of the Communist Party. Konigsberg declined to respond to this line of questioning, insisting that it was an intrusion into areas protected by the Federal Constitution. He also objected on the ground that California law did not require him to divulge his political associations or opinions in order to qualify for the Bar and that questions about these matters were not relevant.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 259]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Committee of Bar Examiners rejected Konigsberg's application on the ground that the evidence in the record raised substantial doubts about his character and his loyalty which he had failed to dispel. At the conclusion of the hearings, the Committee sent a formal written notice - which later served as the basis for his petition to the California Supreme Court - stating that his application was denied because:\n\n 1. He failed to demonstrate that he was a person of good moral character and\n\n\n 2. He failed to show that he did not advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State by force, violence or other unconstitutional means.\n\n\n He was not denied admission to the California Bar simply because he refused to answer questions.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nIn Konigsberg's petition for review to the State Supreme Court there is no suggestion that the Committee had excluded him merely for failing to respond to its inquiries. Nor did the Committee in its answer indicate that this was the basis for its action. After responding to Konigsberg's allegations, the Bar Committee set forth a defense \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 260]\n\u00a0\n of its action which in substance repeated the reasons it had given Konigsberg in the formal notice of denial for rejecting his application.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThere is nothing in the California statutes, the California decisions, or even in the Rules of the Bar Committee, which has been called to our attention, that suggests that failure to answer a Bar Examiner's inquiry is, ipso facto, a basis for excluding an applicant from the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 261]\n\u00a0\n Bar, irrespective of how overwhelming is his showing of good character or loyalty or how flimsy are the suspicions of the Bar Examiners. Serious questions of elemental fairness would be raised if the Committee had excluded Konigsberg simply because he failed to answer questions without first explicitly warning him that he could be barred for this reason alone, even though his moral character and loyalty were unimpeachable, and then giving him a chance to comply.\n14\n In our opinion, there is nothing in the record which indicates that the Committee, in a matter of such grave importance to Konigsberg, applied a brand new exclusionary rule to his application - all without telling him that it was doing so.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nIf it were possible for us to say that the Board had barred Konigsberg solely because of his refusal to respond to its inquiries into his political associations and his opinions about matters of public interest, then we would be compelled to decide far-reaching and complex questions relating to freedom of speech, press and assembly. There is no justification for our straining to reach these difficult problems when the Board itself has not seen fit, at any time, to base its exclusion of Konigsberg on his failure to answer. If and when a State makes failure to answer a question an independent ground for exclusion from the Bar, then this Court, as the cases arise, will have to determine whether the exclusion is constitutionally permissible. We do not mean to intimate any view on that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 262]\n\u00a0\n problem here nor do we mean to approve or disapprove Konigsberg's refusal to answer the particular questions asked him.\n\nWe now pass to the issue which we believe is presented in this case: Does the evidence in the record support any reasonable doubts about Konigsberg's good character or his loyalty to the Governments of State and Nation? In considering this issue, we must, of course, take into account the Committee's contention that Konigsberg's failure to respond to questions was evidence from which some inference of doubtful character and loyalty can be drawn.\n\nKonigsberg claims that he established his good moral character by overwhelming evidence and carried the burden of proving that he does not advocate overthrow of the Government. He contends here, as he did in the California court, that there is no evidence in the record which rationally supports a finding of doubt about his character or loyalty. If this contention is correct, he has been denied the right to practice law although there was no basis for the finding that he failed to meet the qualifications which the State demands of a person seeking to become a lawyer. If this is true, California's refusal to admit him is a denial of due process and of equal protection of the laws because both arbitrary and discriminatory.\n16\n After examination of the record,\n17\n we are compelled to agree with Konigsberg that the evidence does not rationally support the only two grounds upon which the Committee relied in rejecting his application for admission to the California Bar.\n\nA. Good Moral Character. - The term \"good moral character\" has long been used as a qualification for \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 263]\n\u00a0\n membership in the Bar and has served a useful purpose in this respect. However the term, by itself, is unusually ambiguous. It can be defined in an almost unlimited number of ways for any definition will necessarily reflect the attitudes, experiences, and prejudices of the definer.\n18\n Such a vague qualification, which is easily adapted to fit personal views and predilections, can be a dangerous instrument for arbitrary and discriminatory denial of the right to practice law.\n\nWhile we do not have the benefit of a definition of \"good moral character\" by the California Supreme Court in this case, counsel for the State tells us that the definition of that term adopted in California \"stresses elements of honesty, fairness and respect for the rights of others and for the laws of the state and nation.\" The decisions of California courts cited here do not support so broad a definition as claimed by counsel. These cases instead appear to define \"good moral character\" in terms of an absence of proven conduct or acts which have been historically considered as manifestations of \"moral turpitude.\" To illustrate, California has held that an applicant did not have good character who had been convicted of forgery and had practiced law without a license,\n19\n or who had obtained money by false representations and had committed fraud upon a court,\n20\n or who had submitted false affidavits to the Committee along with his application for admission.\n21\n It should be emphasized that neither the definition proposed by counsel nor those appearing in the California cases equates unorthodox political beliefs or membership in lawful political parties \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 264]\n\u00a0\n with bad moral character. Assuming for purposes of this case that counsel's broad definition of \"good moral character\" is the one adopted in California, the question is whether on the whole record a reasonable man could fairly find that there were substantial doubts about Konigsberg's \"honesty, fairness and respect for the rights of others and for the laws of the state and nation.\"\n\nA person called on to prove his character is compelled to turn to the people who know him. Here, forty-two individuals who had known Konigsberg at different times during the past twenty years attested to his excellent character.\n22\n These testimonials came from persons in every walk of life. Included among them were a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi, lawyers, doctors, professors, businessmen and social workers. The following are typical of the statements made about Konigsberg:\n\n An instructor at the University of Southern California  Law School:\n\n\"He seems to hold the Constitution in high esteem and is a vigorous supporter of civil rights. . . . He indicated to me an open-mindedness seemingly inconsistent with any calculated disregard of his duty as a loyal and conscientious citizen.\"\n\n\n A rabbi:\n\n \"I unreservedly recommend Mr. Konigsberg as a person who is morally and ethically qualified to serve as a member of [the bar].\"\n\n\n A lawyer:\n\n \"I recommend Mr. Konigsberg unreservedly as a person of high moral principle and character. . . . \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 265]\n\u00a0\n He is a much more profound person than the average bar applicant and exhibits a social consciousness which, in my opinion, is unfortunately too rare among applicants.\"\n\n\n A Catholic Monsignor:\n\n \"I do not hesitate to recommend him to you. I am satisfied that he will measure up to the high requirements established for members of the legal profession.\"\n\n\n Other witnesses testified to Konigsberg's belief in democracy and devotion to democratic ideas, his principled convictions, his honesty and integrity, his conscientiousness and competence in his work, his concern and affection for his wife and children and his loyalty to the country. These, of course, have traditionally been the kind of qualities that make up good moral character. The significance of the statements made by these witnesses about Konigsberg is enhanced by the fact that they had known him as an adult while he was employed in responsible professional positions. Even more significant, not a single person has testified that Konigsberg's moral character was bad or questionable in any way.\n\nKonigsberg's background, which was also before the Committee, furnished strong proof that his life had always been honest and upright. Born in Austria in 1911, he was brought to this country when eight years old. After graduating from Ohio State University in 1931, he taught American history and literature for a time in a Cleveland high school. In 1934 he was given a scholarship to Ohio State University and there received his Master of Arts degree in Social Administration. He was then employed by the District of Columbia as a supervisor in its Department of Health. In 1936 he went to California where he worked as an executive for several social agencies and at one time served as District Supervisor \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 266]\n\u00a0\n for the California State Relief Administration. With our entry into the Second World War, he volunteered for the Army and was commissioned a second lieutenant. He was selected for training as an orientation officer in the Army's information and education program and in that capacity served in North Africa, Italy, France, and Germany. He was promoted to captain and while in Germany was made orientation officer for the entire Seventh Army. As an orientation officer one of his principal functions was to explain to soldiers the advantages of democracy as compared with totalitarianism. After his honorable discharge in 1946 he resumed his career in social work. In 1950, at the age of thirtynine, Konigsberg entered the Law School of the University of Southern California and was graduated in 1953. There is no criticism in the record of his professional work, his military service, or his performance at the law school.\n\nDespite Konigsberg's forceful showing of good moral character and the fact that there is no evidence that he has ever been convicted of any crime or has ever done anything base or depraved, the State nevertheless argues that substantial doubts were raised about his character by: (1) the testimony of an ex-Communist that Konigsberg had attended meetings of a Communist Party unit in 1941; (2) his criticism of certain public officials and their policies; and (3) his refusal to answer certain questions about his political associations and beliefs. When these items are analyzed, we believe that it cannot rationally be said that they support substantial doubts about Konigsberg's moral fitness to practice law.\n\n(1) Testimony of the Ex-Communist. - The suspicion that Konigsberg was or had been a Communist was based chiefly on the testimony of a single ex-Communist that Konigsberg had attended meetings of a Communist Party unit in 1941. From the witness' testimony it appears that this unit was some kind of discussion group. On cross-examination \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 267]\n\u00a0\n she conceded that her sole basis for believing that Konigsberg was a member of that party was his attendance at these meetings. Her testimony concerned events that occurred many years before and her identification of Konigsberg was not very convincing.\n23\n She admitted that she had not known him personally and never had any contact with him except at these meetings in 1941. Konigsberg denied that he had ever seen her or known her. And in response to a Bar Examiner's question as to whether he was a communist, in the philosophical sense, as distinguished from a member of the Communist Party, Konigsberg replied: \"If you want a categorical answer to `Are you a communist?' the answer is no.\"\n24\n\u00a0\n\nEven if it be assumed that Konigsberg was a member of the Communist Party in 1941, the mere fact of membership would not support an inference that he did not have good moral character.\n25\n There was no evidence that he ever engaged in or abetted any unlawful or immoral activities - or even that he knew of or supported any actions of this nature. It may be, although there is no evidence in the record before us to that effect, that some members of that party were involved in illegal or disloyal activities, but petitioner cannot be swept into this group \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 268]\n\u00a0\n solely on the basis of his alleged membership in that party. In 1941 the Communist Party was a recognized political party in the State of California. Citizens of that State were free to belong to that party if they wanted to do so. The State had not attempted to attach penalties of any kind to membership in the Communist Party. Its candidates' names were on the ballots California submitted to its voters. Those who accepted the State at its word and joined that party had a right to expect that the State would not penalize them, directly or indirectly, for doing so thereafter.\n26\n\u00a0\n\n(2) Criticism of Certain Public Officials and Their Policies. - In 1950 Konigsberg wrote a series of editorials for a local newspaper. In these editorials he severely criticized, among other things, this country's participation in the Korean War, the actions and policies of the leaders of the major political parties, the influence of \"big business\" in American life, racial discrimination, and this Court's decisions in Dennis and other cases.\n27\n When read in the light of the ordinary give-and-take of political controversy the editorials Konigsberg wrote are not unusually \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 269]\n\u00a0\n extreme and fairly interpreted only say that certain officials were performing their duties in a manner that, in the opinion of the writer, was injurious to the public. We do not believe that an inference of bad moral character can rationally be drawn from these editorials.\n28\n Because of the very nature of our democracy such expressions of political views must be permitted. Citizens have a right under our constitutional system to criticize government officials and agencies. Courts are not, and should not be, immune to such criticism.\n29\n Government censorship can no more be reconciled with our national constitutional standard of freedom of speech and press when done in the guise of determining \"moral character,\" than if it should be attempted directly.\n\n(3) Refusal to Answer Questions. - During the prolonged hearings before the Committee of Bar Examiners, Konigsberg was not asked directly about his honesty, trustworthiness, or other traits which are generally thought of as related to good character. Almost all of the Bar Examiners' questions concerned his political affiliations, editorials and beliefs. Konigsberg repeatedly declined to answer such questions, explaining that his refusal was based on his understanding that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution a State could not inquire into a person's political opinions or associations and that he had a duty not to answer. Essentially, this is the same stand he had \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 270]\n\u00a0\n taken several years before when called upon to answer similar questions before the Tenney Committee.\n\nThe State argues that Konigsberg's refusal to tell the Examiners whether he was a member of the Communist Party or whether he had associated with persons who were members of that party or groups which were allegedly Communist dominated tends to support an inference that he is a member of the Communist Party and therefore a person of bad moral character. We find it unnecessary to decide if Konigsberg's constitutional objections to the Committee's questions were well founded. Prior decisions by this Court indicate that his claim that the questions were improper was not frivolous\n30\n and we find nothing in the record which indicates that his position was not taken in good faith. Obviously the State could not draw unfavorable inferences as to his truthfulness, candor or his moral character in general if his refusal to answer was based on a belief that the United States Constitution prohibited the type of inquiries which the Committee was making.\n31\n On the record before us, it is our judgment that the inferences of bad moral character which the Committee attempted to draw from \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 271]\n\u00a0\n Konigsberg's refusal to answer questions about his political affiliations and opinions are unwarranted.\n\nB. Advocating the Overthrow of Government by Force. - The Committee also found that Konigsberg had failed to prove that he did not advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States or California by force and violence. Konigsberg repeatedly testified under oath before the Committee that he did not believe in nor advocate the overthrow of any government in this country by any unconstitutional means. For example, in response to one question as to whether he advocated overthrowing the Government, he emphatically declared: \"I answer specifically I do not, I never did or never will.\" No witness testified to the contrary. As a matter of fact, many of the witnesses gave testimony which was utterly inconsistent with the premise that he was disloyal.\n32\n And Konigsberg told the Committee that he was ready at any time to take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of California.\n33\n\u00a0\n\nEven if it be assumed that Konigsberg belonged to the Communist Party in 1941, this does not provide a reasonable basis for a belief that he presently advocates overthrowing the Government by force.\n34\n The ex-Communist, who testified that Konigsberg attended meetings of a Communist unit in 1941, could not remember any statements by him or anyone else at those meetings advocating \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 272]\n\u00a0\n the violent overthrow of the Government. And certainly there is nothing in the newspaper editorials that Konigsberg wrote that tends to support a finding that he champions violent overthrow. Instead, the editorials expressed hostility to such a doctrine. For example, Konigsberg wrote:\n\n \"It is vehemently asserted that advocacy of force and violence is a danger to the American government and that its proponents should be punished. With this I agree. Such advocacy is un-American and does undermine our democratic processes. Those who preach it must be punished.\"\n\n\n Counsel for California offers the following editorial as evidence that Konigsberg advocates overthrow of the Government by force and violence:\n\n \"Loyalty to America, in my opinion, has always meant adherence to the basic principles of our Constitution and Declaration of Independence - not loyalty to any man or group of men. Loyalty to America means belief in and militant support of her noble ideals and the faith of her people. Loyalty to America today, therefore, must mean opposition to those who are betraying our country's traditions, who are squandering her manpower, her honor and her riches.\"\n\n\n On its surface this editorial does not appear to be a call for armed revolution. To the contrary, it manifests a strongly held conviction for our constitutional system of government. However, the State attempts to draw an inference adverse to Konigsberg from his use of the word \"militant\" which it points out in one sense means \"warlike.\" To us it seems far-fetched to say that exhortation to \"militant\" support of America's \"noble ideals\" demonstrates \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 273]\n\u00a0\n a willingness to overthrow our democratic institutions.\n35\n\u00a0\n\nWe recognize the importance of leaving States free to select their own bars, but it is equally important that the State not exercise this power in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner nor in such way as to impinge on the freedom of political expression or association. A bar composed of lawyers of good character is a worthy objective but it is unnecessary to sacrifice vital freedoms in order to obtain that goal. It is also important both to society and the bar itself that lawyers be unintimidated - free to think, speak, and act as members of an Independent Bar.\n36\n In this case we are compelled to conclude that there is no evidence in the record which rationally justifies a finding that Konigsberg failed to establish his good moral character or failed to show that he did not advocate forceful overthrow of the Government. Without some authentic reliable evidence of unlawful or immoral actions reflecting adversely upon him, it is difficult to comprehend why the State Bar Committee rejected a man of Konigsberg's background and character as morally unfit to practice law. As we said before, the mere fact of Konigsberg's past membership in the Communist Party, if true, without anything more, is not an adequate basis for concluding that he is disloyal or a person of bad character. A lifetime of good citizenship \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 274]\n\u00a0\n is worth very little if it is so frail that it cannot withstand the suspicions which apparently were the basis for the Committee's action.\n\nThe judgment of the court below is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Under California procedure the State Supreme Court may admit a person to the bar upon certification by the Committee of Bar Examiners that he meets the necessary requirements. California Business and Professions Code, 1937, 6064. Section 6060 (c) requires that an applicant must have \"good moral character\" before he can be certified. Section 6064.1 provides that no person \"who advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of this State by force, violence, or other unconstitutional means, shall be certified to the Supreme Court for admission and a license to practice law.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See also Preston v. State Bar of California, 28 Cal. 2d 643, 171 P.2d 435; Brydonjack v. State Bar of California, 208 Cal. 439, 281 P. 1018.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Rule 59 (b) is set out at 36 Cal. 2d 43.

That the petitioner sustained his burden of proof of establishing his good moral character and all other requirements established by law in the State of California for applicants for admission to the bar.\n\n\n\"2. That the committee erred in asserting that the petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proof of establishing his good moral character.\n\n\n\"3. That no lawful evidence was received or exists supporting the denial of the application of the petitioner.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] He also referred to Near v.

Hoboken Co., 1 Wall. 116.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The record, when read as a whole, shows that Konigsberg took the position that he would answer all questions about his character or loyalty except those directed to his political views and beliefs and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 259]\n\u00a0\n to questions about membership in the Communist Party. The record also shows that the Committee made no effort to pursue any other course of interrogation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Neither the Committee as a whole nor any of its members ever intimated that Konigsberg would be barred just because he refused to answer relevant inquiries or because he was obstructing the Committee. Some members informed him that they did not necessarily accept his position that they were not entitled to inquire into his political associations and opinions and said that his failure to answer would have some bearing on their determination of whether he was qualified. But they never suggested that his failure to answer their questions was, by itself, a sufficient independent ground for denial of his application.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The answer, in pertinent part, read as follows:\n\n\"[P]etitioner was invited to appear at a hearing before the Southern Subcommittee of the Committee of Bar Examiners on the 25th day of September, 1953, at which time he was informed of evidence raising doubts as to his fitness to practice law, and was questioned concerning such evidence and other matters relevant to his qualifications to become a member of the State Bar of California.\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"On or before the 8th day of February, 1954 the Southern Subcommittee of the Committee of Bar Examiners considered all of the evidence which had been presented, and determined that petitioner had failed to show his good moral character so that his application must be denied. On or about the 8th day of February, 1954 said Subcommittee informed the petitioner in writing of the denial of his application and the reasons therefor.\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"On or prior to the 17th day of May, 1954 [the Full Committee] considered all of the evidence which had been introduced and determined that petitioner had not sustained the burden of proof that he was possessor of the good moral character required by California Business and Professions Code, Section 6060 (c) and that he had not complied with Section 6064.1 of said Code, so that his application must be denied. Petitioner was notified of this decision and the reasons therefor by letter dated May 17, 1954.\n\n\n\"Petitioner has not complied with the requirements of California Business and Professions Code, Sections 6060 (c) and 6064.1 and so is not entitled to be and should not be admitted to practice law in the State of California.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n As pointed out in note 1, supra, 6064.1 excludes applicants who advocate the overthrow of the Government of California or the United States by \"unconstitutional means,\" while 6060 (c) requires that an applicant must have good moral character.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Cf. Cole v. Arkansas, \n333 \nU.S. 196, 201\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] In presenting its version of the questions before this Court, the Bar Committee did not suggest that the denial of Konigsberg's application could be upheld merely because he had failed to answer questions. Nor was such a position taken on oral argument. Counsel, instead, reiterated what the Bar Committee had contended throughout, namely, that Konigsberg was rejected because he failed to dispel substantial doubts raised by the evidence in the record about his character and loyalty.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Schware v.

He stated: \"Now Mrs. Bennett's testimony left much to be desired, that I concede. Her identification of this man is not all that you might wish.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] Konigsberg gave this answer during the first hearing held by the Committee. He was not represented by counsel at the time. At a subsequent hearing he stated that his earlier willingness to answer this question was inconsistent with his general position that the Committee had no right to inquire into his political associations and beliefs. He said he would not answer if the same question were then presented to him.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, ante, p. 232; Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n.

At that time he sharply criticized this committee, accusing it of subverting the liberties of Americans, and declared:\n\n\"I pledge my word to use every democratic means to defeat you.\"\n\n\n The State points to petitioner's criticism of this committee as casting doubt on his moral character.

Curtis, one of the ablest Justices who ever sat on this Court, cannot be too often repeated: \"Let it be remembered, also, - for just now we may be in some danger of forgetting it, - that questions of jurisdiction were questions of power as between the United States and the several States.\" 2 Memoir of Curtis 340-341. The importance of keeping within the limits of federal jurisdiction was emphasized in the opinion of Mr. Justice Stone, for a unanimous Court, in Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263, 270\n: \"Due regard for the rightful independence of state governments, which should actuate federal courts, requires that they scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits which the statute [`the action of Congress in conformity to the judiciary sections of the Constitution'] has defined.\"\n\nPrerequisites to the power of this Court to review a judgment of a state court are that a federal claim was \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 275]\n\u00a0\n properly before the state court and that the state court based its decision on that claim. If a state court judgment is rested on a non-federal ground, i. e., on relevant state law, this Court is constitutionally barred from reviewing it. While a State may not, under the guise of regulating its local procedure, strangle a federal claim so as to prevent it from coming before a state court, it has the undoubted power to prescribe appropriate procedure for bringing all questions for determination before its courts. Squeezing out of the record in this case all that can be squeezed, the most that the five pages of the Court's opinion dealing with this threshold question can be said to demonstrate is that there is doubt whether or not the claim under the United States Constitution was properly presented to the California Supreme Court, according to its requirements.\n\nBefore this Court can find that a State - and the judgment of the Supreme Court of California expresses \"the power of the State as a whole,\" Rippey v. Texas, \n193 \nU.S. 504, 509\n; Skiriotes v. Florida, \n313 \nU.S. 69, 79\n - has violated the Constitution, it must be clear from the record that the state court has in fact passed on a federal question. As a safeguard against intrusion upon state power, it has been our practice when a fair doubt is raised whether a state court has in fact adjudicated a properly presented federal claim not to assume or presume that it has done so. The Court has not based its power to review on guess-work. It has remanded the case to the state court to enable it to make clear by appropriate certification that it has in fact rested its decision on rejection of a federal claim and has not reached its decision on an adequate state ground. Strict adherence to the jurisdictional requirement was insisted upon in Whitney v. California, the well-known civil liberties case, by a Court that included Justices Holmes and Brandeis, as mindful as any in protecting the liberties guaranteed by \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 276]\n\u00a0\n the Due Process Clause. Whitney v. California, \n269 \nU.S. 530, 538\n; \n274 \nU.S. 357\n. See also Honeyman v. Hanan, \n300 \nU.S. 14\n; cf. Minnesota v. National Tea Co., \n309 \nU.S. 551\n.\n\nThe procedure of making sure, through appropriate certification by a state court, that the federal question was in fact adjudicated, is a safeguard against infringement of powers that belong to the States and at the same time duly protects this Court's jurisdiction to review denial of a federal claim by a state court, if in fact it becomes clear that there was such a denial. This may involve some delay in the final determination of a federal question. The price of such delay is small enough cost in the proper functioning of our federal system in one of its important aspects. This Court has a special responsibility to be particularly mindful of the respective boundaries between state and federal authority.\n\nI would remand the case to the Supreme Court of California for its certification whether or not it did in fact pass on a claim properly before it under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, dissenting.\n\nI share the jurisdictional views of my brother FRANKFURTER. Even so, since the Court decides the case on the merits, I feel it appropriate to deal with it on that basis, since the case is important and my views about it differ widely from those of the Court. I feel impelled to do so, more particularly, for two reasons: (1) The record, in my opinion, reveals something quite different from that which the Court draws from it; (2) this case involves an area of federal-state relations - the right of States to establish and administer standards for admission to their bars - into which this Court should be especially reluctant and slow to enter. Granting that this area of state action \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 277]\n\u00a0\n is not exempt from federal constitutional limitations, see Schware v. Board of Examiners, ante, p. 232, decided today, I think that in doing what it does here the Court steps outside its proper role as the final arbiter of such limitations, and acts instead as if it were a super state court of appeals.\n\nThe following is what I believe to be an accurate statement of the issue to be decided. California makes it one of its requirements concerning admission to its Bar that no one be certified to the Supreme Court who advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of California by force or violence. It also requires that an applicant be of good moral character. The applicant has the burden of proof in showing that these requirements have been met. Petitioner, under examination by the designated state agency, made unequivocal disavowal of advocacy of the overthrow of the Government by force or violence. With a view to testing the reliability of this disavowal, and the moral character of petitioner, the Bar Examiners questioned him about organizations to which he belonged, especially current or past membership in the Communist Party. Petitioner persisted in refusing to answer these questions despite the entirely reasoned and repeated efforts of members of the Committee to secure answers. His refusals were not based on a claim that the questions were irrelevant to an examination of his fitness under California law. The refusals were based solely on the ground that constitutionally the Committee was limited to asking him whether he advocated the overthrow of the Government by force and violence, and having asked that question, it could ask him no related question.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing circumstances, the Supreme Court of California refused to overrule the finding of the Bar Committee that he had not qualified for admission to the Bar. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 278]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe question for this Court is whether in so refusing petitioner admission to the Bar, California through its Supreme Court deprived petitioner of liberty and property without due process.\n\nAt the outset there should be laid aside certain things which are not involved in this case. The Court does not find wanting in any respect California's requirements for admission to the Bar - that an applicant (a) must be \"a person of good moral character,\"\n1\n and (b) must not be an advocate of the overthrow of the Federal or State Government \"by force, violence, or other unconstitutional means.\"\n2\n Nor does the Court question the state rule of practice placing the burden of proof on the applicant in both respects.\n3\n The Court does not hold that the First or Fourteenth Amendment entitled Konigsberg to refuse to answer any of the questions put to him by the Bar Committee,\n4\n or that any of such questions were irrelevant or improper. The fairness of the four hearings \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 279]\n\u00a0\n accorded Konigsberg is not attacked in any respect.\n5\n The Court's decision rests wholly on the alleged insufficiency of the record to support the Committee's conclusion that Konigsberg had failed to meet the burden of establishing that he was a person of good moral character and not an advocate of violent overthrow of the Government. The Court says:\n\n\". . . we are compelled to conclude that there is no evidence in the record which rationally justifies a finding that Konigsberg failed to establish his good moral character or failed to show that he did not advocate forceful overthrow of the Government. Without some authentic reliable evidence of unlawful or immoral actions reflecting adversely upon him, it is difficult to comprehend why the State Bar Committee rejected a man of Konigsberg's background and character as morally unfit to practice law.\"\n\n\n This makes the record important. Before turning to it, however, it will be well to revert to the true character of the issue before us. The Court decides the case as if the issue were whether the record contains evidence demonstrating as a factual matter that Konigsberg had a bad moral character. I do not think that is the issue. The question before us, it seems to me, is whether it violates the Fourteenth Amendment for a state bar committee \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 280]\n\u00a0\n to decline to certify for admission to the bar an applicant who obstructs a proper investigation into his qualifications by deliberately, and without constitutional justification, refusing to answer questions relevant to his fitness under valid standards, and who is therefore deemed by the State, under its law, to have failed to carry his burden of proof to establish that he is qualified.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nI do not understand the process of reasoning by which the Court attempts to make a separate issue out of petitioner's refusal to answer questions, and then, in effect, reads it out of the case because California has not constituted such refusal an \"independent\" ground for denying admission. What the State has done, and what the Bar Committee repeatedly warned the petitioner it would do,\n7\n is to say that the petitioner's refusal to answer questions made it impossible to proceed to an affirmative certification that he was qualified - i. e., that his refusal placed him in a position where he must be deemed to have failed to sustain his burden of proof. Whether the State was justified in doing this under the Fourteenth Amendment is the sole issue before us, and that issue is not susceptible of the fragmentation to which the Court seeks to subject it. I am unable to follow the Court when it says, on the one hand, that on the issue of petitioner's qualifications \"we must, of course, take into account the Committee's contention that Konigsberg's failure to respond to \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 281]\n\u00a0\n questions was evidence from which some inference of doubtful character and loyalty can be drawn,\"\n8\n and, on the other hand, that the Committee was not entitled to treat petitioner's refusal to answer as a failure on his part to meet the burden of proof as to his qualifications.\n\nOf course California has not laid down an abstract rule that refusal to answer any question under any circumstances ipso facto calls for denial of admission to the Bar. But just because the State has no such abstract statutory rule does not mean that a Bar Committee cannot in a particular case conclude that failure to answer particular questions so blocks the inquiry that it is unable to certify the applicant as qualified. In other words, what California has done here is to say that the Committee was justified in concluding that refusal to answer these questions under these circumstances means that the applicant has failed to meet the requirement that he set forth his qualifications affirmatively. Thus I think the Court is quite mistaken in stating that \"the Board itself has not seen fit, at any time, to base its exclusion of Konigsberg \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 282]\n\u00a0\n on his failure to answer.\" I turn now to the State's brief and the record, which show, it seems to me, that failure to answer was the reason for exclusion.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nI had not supposed that it could be seriously contended that California's requirements for admission to the bar do not authorize the rejection of a candidate for constitutionally unprotected obstruction of a valid investigation into his qualifications under such requirements. Cf. Schware v. Board of Examiners, supra (concurring opinion). And it is unmistakable from the State's brief in this Court that California does claim the right, in the circumstances of this case, to reject the petitioner for his refusal to answer the questions that were relevant to his qualifications under the State's requirements for admission to the Bar.\n9\n The following appears on pp. 56-59 of that brief:\n\n \"Even where no serious doubt arises with respect  to an applicant's qualifications, it is standard practice  to inquire into many personal matters which a  person is normally privileged to keep to himself.  Thus, the standard application form required of all  applicants asks the applicant for details of his past  employment, education, whether he was ever suspended,  reprimanded or censured as a member of any  profession or organization, whether he has ever been  arrested, whether he has ever been a party to a lawsuit  and for the details of any incidents of a derogatory  nature bearing on his fitness to practice law.  If the answers to such questions embarrass an applicant, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 283]\n\u00a0\n  he is privileged to refuse to answer just as he is  privileged to refuse to answer any question on the  Bar examination. However, in either case he runs  the risk that failure to answer such questions will  prevent his admission to the Bar.\n\n\n  \"Respondents submit that it is in no sense unreasonable  or improper to require an applicant to cooperate  in supplying all requested information that is  relevant to his statutory qualifications. . . .\n\n\n  \"(a) Good Moral Character: - Reasonable doubts  that petitioner was a person of good moral character  arose from many sources:\n\n\n .   .  .  .  .\n\n\n  \"(5) Petitioner's refusal to answer questions in  such broad areas of inquiry as to effectively prevent  inquiry into broad areas of doubt.\n\n\n .   .  .   .  .\n\n\n  \"Petitioner stated that he did not advocate the  violent overthrow of the government. He thereafter  took the position that any further inquiry by the  Committee with respect to this requirement was foreclosed.  This is equivalent to his appearing before  the Committee and stating that he is a person of  good moral character and the Committee must accept  his statement and not inquire further. Even were  there no adverse evidence in the record, respondents  could properly refuse to certify an applicant as not  having established his compliance with . . . Section  6064.1, where, as here, he took the position that his  bare answer that he complied with the requirement  foreclosed further inquiry. . . .\" (Italics, except as  to subheading \"(a),\" added.)\n\n\n I now turn to the record which also shows in unmistakable terms that the Committee's primary concern related \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 284]\n\u00a0\n to the petitioner's persistent blocking of its efforts to test the veracity of his statement that he did not advocate forcible overthrow of government.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe story is best told in the language of the record itself. I shall interpolate only to the extent necessary to put what is quoted in context.\n\nThe first hearing before the Subcommittee took place on September 25, 1953. At that time Konigsberg appeared without counsel. After some preliminary inquiries as to Konigsberg's history, and questioning as to his connections with allegedly \"subversive\" organizations, the following ensued:\n\n \"Q. I assume that you are acquainted with the  State statute that we now have on our books where  among other things we are obliged to inquire into  this type of a thing, and where we find that any  people appear to have the views of endeavoring to  change our government and so forth by force or violence,  or in other words the popular conception of  communism that we are expressly prohibited from  certifying that person. You are familiar with the  statute?\n\n\n  \"A. Yes, I am.\n\n\n  \"Q. Mr. Konigsberg, are you a Communist?\n\n\n  \"A. Mr. Chairman, I would be very glad to answer  that question.\n\n\n  \"Q. If you will answer the question, I would be  very happy to have it.\n\n\n  \"A. I would be very glad to answer it if the circumstances  were different. That is when I am faced  with a question of this kind or when anyone else is \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 285]\n\u00a0\n  faced with a question of this kind today what he is  faced with is the fact that various nameless accusers  or informers, or call them what you will, whom he  has never had a chance to confront and cross-examine,  he is put in a position of answering these statements  or accusations or suspicions, and without any of  the protections that ordinarily exist in such a situation,  and I don't think that I can place myself in  that position of having to answer something out in  the void, some statement. I know these statements  have been made obviously. I am not pretending to  be shocked or naive about this. I can say very definitely  I did not, I don't, I never would advocate the  overthrow of the government by force or violence  clearly and unequivocably, but to answer a specific  question of that kind, whether I am a member of  this party, that party or the Communist party, that  puts me in the position, whatever the truth is,  whether I was or wasn't you would get a dozen  informers who would say the opposite, and as indicated  by an editorial just two or three days ago in  the Daily News questioning seriously why the word  of these informers, these turn-coats is accepted unquestionably  as against the word of other responsible  citizens. Therefore, Mr. Preston, I do not think that  under these circumstances, first, yes, I understand  that under the law as it is today you may ask me specifically  do I advocate the overthrow of the government  by force or violence. I answer specifically I  do not, I never did or never will. When you get  into the other question of specific views in a political  party, it seems to me only the fact, the right of  political opinion is protected under the First Amendment  and is binding on the states. Certainly attorneys  ought to be in the leadership of those who defend  the right of diverse political views. I think the First \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 286]\n\u00a0\n  Amendment is important . . . . I answer again on  the specific question of force and violence, I did not,  I don't and never would advocate the overthrow of  the government by force or violence.\n\n\n  \"Q. When answering it you don't intend to give  us a specific, categorical responsive answer?\n\n\n  \"A. As I said I would be very happy to if we met  out in the hall. I would be glad to answer you, but  you see under these circumstances, that is I am speaking  now under oath and I am speaking for the record,  I am speaking against in a sense whatever evidence  that may be in the files - I shouldn't dignify it by  calling it evidence; I should say whatever statements  may be there from various informers. I have told  you about my record both in the Army and in the  community. I have been active politically, I admit  it. I am proud of it. I would be happy to discuss it.  This is the record that I think should be the basis  for judgment, not the record of some hysterical characters  that appeared before the Tenney Committee  or any such group.\n\n\n  \"Q. I am not asking anyone else. I am trying to  ask you because you are the one who is seeking admission,  the privilege of practicing law in this state.  That is the reason I am asking you the question. I  made the question very broad, and what I would like  you to tell us, if you will answer the question; now  of course as you well know and you have told me in  your answer up to this point, you don't have to  answer the question, of course you don't have to  answer the question, but we feel that on a matter of  this kind, this kind of information, we have a job  to inquire about your character. The statute says  character, it doesn't say reputation. The only way  I can find out and aid this Committee in finding out  about your character is to ask you these questions, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 287]\n\u00a0\n  not what someone else thinks about you, your reputation.  That is the reason I have asked the question.  Could you give us a categorical answer?\n\n\n  \"A. I can only give you the answer I have given  you, and I would be very happy to answer that under  other circumstances.\"\n\n\n At this point Konigsberg stated that his refusals to answer rested on rights of \"free opinion, free speech,\" and that the legal profession should be the champion of \"the right to diverse political opinion.\" He was then asked whether he had \"ever knowingly participated in an organization which [he] then believed was sympathetic to the communistic cause,\" to which he replied that \"I can't say I knowingly did that, because I don't think it would have made a great deal of difference to me if I had known one way or the other\" if the organization's objectives were what he believed in, \"say a better School Board or whatever the issue might have been.\" Then followed this:\n\n \"Q. Mr. Konigsberg, I assume that you know that your name has been listed in the public press by witnesses before the Congressional Un-American Activities Committee.\n\n\n \"A. Yes.\n\n\n \"Q. And have been identified by persons who said that you were a member of the Communist Party at the same time they were.\n\n\n \"A. I saw that report. That is the sort of thing I was referring to a moment ago when I referred to the various accusations.\"\n\n\n Next there was discussion as to the attitude of the Association of American Universities with reference to teachers claiming the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination:\n\n \"Mr. Sterling: Let me try to clarify it as I understand  it. This Association of Universities takes the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 288]\n\u00a0\n  position that complete candor on the part of the  teacher with respect to his political beliefs, and in  particular whether or not he subscribes to the beliefs  of the Communist Party is a prerequisite to continuing  in the teaching job. He doesn't have to disclose  whether or not he is a Communist or is sympathetic  to the Communist beliefs, but that if he doesn't  answer those questions with complete candor he has  lost his right to a position in the teaching community.  Translating that into terms of an Association of lawyers  such as our State Bar or any Bar Association,  you are seeking admission to the profession and that  we as your prospective colleagues have a right to  expect complete candor from you on this particular  question, and that if you don't wish to be completely  candid with us then we are justified in saying you  don't belong in our profession. That I think is the  stand that the American Universities took.\n\n\n  \"A. I understand that. I can only say what I said  several times already. Under those circumstances  the constitutional guarantee of free speech means  nothing, if it doesn't mean you can keep your views  to yourself, and certainly lawyers recognize that  and should be among the first to defend that right.  I think the legal profession, particularly the leaders  of the legal profession, should be the first to insist on  it. Put another way, of what meaning is any constitutional  guarantee if it becomes a crime to invoke  that guarantee?\"\n\n\n This answer was then elaborated by the petitioner at some length, after which the record continues as follows:\n\n  \"Mr. Sterling: If you accept as true the premise  that the Communist Party, as it is embodied in the  present Soviet Union government, has for its objective  the overthrow of not only the government of the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 289]\n\u00a0\n  United States but any other non-communist government,  and that that overthrow may be accomplished  either from within by a bloodless revolution or if  necessary by force, if you accept that premise then I  think that your argument about constitutional rights  of free speech and right to have your own political  views and so on go by the board because then it seems  to me that we are asking you no more than whether  or not you belong to or believe in the principles of  such an organization as Mafia, which is pretty generally,  I think, regarded as one which has objectives  that can be accomplished according to their tenets  by what we regard as criminal acts. Now if I asked  you whether or not you believed in the right to  murder you would answer me no, I think, but as I say  this whole business seems to be a turn on whether you  accept the premise that the Communist Party - I am  paraphrasing for the purpose of illustration - if you  accept the premise that the Communist Party  believes in murder and has that as its objective then  I don't think you have a right or justification to  refuse to answer the question of whether you belong  to the Communist Party or whether you believe in its  principles, you see.\n\n\n  \"A. Well I can't argue with you.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Sterling: Well, you can say that you think  my premise is wrong. You can say the Communist  Party as constituted does not believe in the overthrow,  is not trying to and does not have as its objective  the overthrow of the United States by one means  or the other. Then I simply have to disagree with  you because it seems to me that is their objective.\n\n\n  \"A. Well, are you suggesting, Mr. Chairman, that  since of course this is a critical period in our country's  history that in the face of such threats as you  are basing your premise on that we have to forego \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 290]\n\u00a0\n  then the use of the constitutional privileges or the  protection of the Constitution, is that what your proposal  is? I would like to understand your argument.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Sterling: No, as I say you don't feel there is  any question of constitutional privilege when in a  proceeding such as this where we are charged with  determining the moral qualifications of an applicant  in the profession, you don't feel that the constitutional  privilege is hurt if I ask you if you believed  in murder?\n\n\n  \"A. No.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Sterling: You will answer that unhesitatingly,  `No, I don't believe in murder.' So I say  that most of us now accept as true the premise that  the Communist Party as we know it and as embodied  in the Russian Government, the present Soviet Union  Government, does have as its objective world domination  by the Communist Party. So we accept that  premise. Therefore it seems to us that we have the  right to ask the question of applicants for admission  to the Bar, because our statute as we pointed out says  that you are not qualified if you do believe in overthrowing  or advocate the overthrow of the United  States by force or violence.\n\n\n  \"A. I am answering specifically in terms of that  statute too that I do not. That is the question you  are asking me specifically. I am answering I never  did, I do not and I never would advocate the overthrow  of the government by force or violence. I do  believe like leaders like Jefferson people should  have the right through discussion, ballot, the minority  view becomes the majority view, that changes  like that are sought through the ballot box but never  through force and violence. That I do not believe.  I think my whole experience has shown that. I \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 291]\n\u00a0\n  don't know how more direct that can be, and the  only reason as I said before that I don't specifically  answer the question, `Are you a member of this  political party?' is because of the situation anyone  is in who is faced with accusations as indicated by  the newspaper report, accusations by people who I  think are gradually being discredited by many  sources, when you don't know who it is who is accusing  you, you don't know on what evidence, anonymous  faces, you never have a chance to cross examine  them, how can anyone be put in that position?  What can you fight except wind-mills and air in such  a situation. The direct question, `Do you believe in  force and violence?' I answered that.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Black: It still puzzles me a little to see why  it is that you think you are prejudicing your own  position by taking a position on that irrespective of  whether there is any other evidence in the file or not.\n\n\n  \"A. Because very practically this as you know has  happened before. In the theory of today it is the  words of these informers that is accepted above the  words of anyone else.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Black: How do you know?\n\n\n  \"A. The newspaper report says so. Isn't that the  report you were referring to where I was named  before the Un-American Activities Committee?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Preston: Yes, but that doesn't answer the  question.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Black: How do you assume this Committee  accepts the hearsay report against your direct testimony?\n\n\n  \"A. I am not assuming that. I didn't mean to  give that implication. What I am saying is that  where on one side we have these hearsay reports and  nameless informers, and I don't need to go into a \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 292]\n\u00a0\n  discussion of how willing they are to sell their evidence,  if it is evidence, when there is the possibility  of their word being placed against my word or  anyone in my position, and because in view of the  hysteria today their word is accepted. All it has to  do is appear in the paper and you are discredited.  Wasn't it two or three weeks ago in San Francisco a  woman won an amount in a suit for being called a  `Red,' a teacher, when it is prima facie - libel, whatever  the case was. Then it becomes not only a basic  matter of principle on the First Amendment but a  matter of protecting yourself in a legal situation,  because this is an official body. I am not talking to  a group of people like I would be talking to on the  street.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Sterling: You are afraid if you answer the  question as to membership in the Communist Party  in the negative and say, `No, I am not a member and  I never have been,' assuming you made that answer,  you are afraid that we could find half a dozen people  who would say that you were and had been, and  therefore if you were on a perjury trial and the jury  believed them and not you, you committed perjury.\n\n\n  \"A. I am saying no matter what answer I gave  whether I was or wasn't, undoubtedly there would  be several whom you could get to say the opposite,  and as I said before -\n\n\n  \"Mr. Sterling: Subjecting you to a perjury charge?\n\n\n  \"A. Yes. As I said before if you want to ask me  outside in the hall I will tell you, but in view of these  circumstances where you just have no right, you have  no opportunity rather, to defend yourself against  these people, I don't think that is fair play. I don't  think that is justice. I don't think it is what the  American democratic system teaches.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 293]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n At this point Konigsberg testified that he did not recall knowing a Mrs. Bennett (formerly Mrs. Judson), the Subcommittee's next witness, the following occurring just before she testified:\n\n  \"Mr. Preston: Is there any further statement you  wish to make, Mr. Konigsberg?\n\n\n  \"A. By the Witness: I can't think of anything I  could add to what I said unless there is some specific  point you want me to enlarge on.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Preston: I assume, of course, if I ask you the  question as to if you were ever a member of the  Communist Party you would give me substantially  the same answer.\n\n\n  \"A. Yes, I think I would.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Preston: You observed, I assumed, Mr. Konigsberg,  I didn't ask you in the first instance if you  were a member of the Communist Party. I asked  you if you were a Communist. I recognize there is  a philosophical Communist. I made my first question  very broad to include that.\n\n\n  \"A. I understood you to say a member of the Communist  Party.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Preston: Would your answer be any different?\n\n\n  \"A. I thought you said a member of the Communist  Party.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Preston: I deliberately did not. The first  question we discussed at length is, `Are you a Communist?'\n\n\n  \"A. I will say no, definitely no. The only thing  I would describe myself very simply as one who has  read a lot, studied a lot, because as a teacher of  history and political education in the Army I believe  strongly in the fundamental concepts of our democratic  system. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 294]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  \"Mr. Preston: Your answer that you gave was  directed to the question, `Are you a member of the  Communist Party?'\n\n\n  \"A. Yes, and solely to that. If you want a categorical  answer to `Are you a communist?' the answer  is no.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Preston: You gave us that.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Sterling: That is your answer.\n\n\n  \"A. By the Witness: No.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Black: Would you care to state whether you  have ever been a Communist?\n\n\n  \"A. Do you mean by that as he is making the  distinction philosophically or a member of the Communist  Party?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Black: I mean in the same sense you have  just answered that you are not now a Communist.\n\n\n  \"A. I would say my thinking has only been what  I described a moment ago as being based on the elementary  concepts of the American democracy, assuming  that you mean do I think like a Communist; that  is assuming we have some common understanding  what you mean by that term.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Sterling: We are not talking now about a  membership in any party.\n\n\n  \"A. Yes, philosophical views.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Bennett, an ex-Communist Party member, then testified, in the presence of Konigsberg, that Konigsberg had attended in 1941 meetings of the party unit of which she had been a member.\n\nThe next hearing was on December 9, 1953, which was attended by Konigsberg's counsel, a Mr. Mosk. This hearing was devoted in part to the cross-examination of Mrs. Bennett by Mr. Mosk, the net of which was that Mrs. Bennett admitted that she recognized Konigsberg when she first came to the earlier hearing only after not seeing anyone else in the room with whom she was \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 295]\n\u00a0\n familiar. After general colloquy as to some of the petitioner's writings, the questioning returned to Konigsberg's refusal to answer questions concerning his alleged membership in the Communist Party, this time with particular reference as to how petitioner reconciled his First Amendment claim with his willingness to answer ideological questions, but not questions as to whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party. The record continues:\n\n  \"Mr. Freston: May I ask a question of counsel?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Sterling: Yes.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Freston: One of the things that was bothering  me, Mr. Mosk, is the general answer we have  received to the question concerning present and past  Communist affiliation, and I recognize the objection  that counsel raises under the First Amendment.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Mosk: The witness.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Freston: The witness has raised. The thing  that troubles me is we have an affirmative duty under  the statute to certify as to this applicant's good moral  character. We have endeavored to point out to him  that the burden of showing that character is upon  him. It appeared to me that he wasn't being quite  forthright with us in not giving us an answer to those  questions. He stated in effect his reason, at least as  I understood it, that he did not want to answer the  questions because he might sometime be accused of  or prosecuted for perjury. Now, that is the rationale  as I remember it, and frankly I am left in a rather  confused state. As a member of this Committee I  have to take an affirmative act of certification as  to a good moral character. I wonder if you could  perhaps enlighten me or help clarify the situation so  perhaps maybe I might understand it better.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Black: May I interpose another question  directed to the same point, and you can answer them \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 296]\n\u00a0\n  at one and the same time. Just to make sure that I  understand the witness' position, at the last hearing  - Mr. Konigsberg's position - as I understood he  was perfectly willing to deny categorically he is a  Communist and took that position, am I right on  that?\n\n\n  \"The Witness: I said philosophical Communist.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Black: It seems to me that question we  wouldn't have a right to ask you under your argument,  but that we would very definitely have a right  to ask you whether you are now a member of the  Communist party as it is commonly understood.  Now, am I right on that that you still take the position  that there is no objection to your answering us  categorically that you are not now a Communist,  namely that you don't believe in the philosophical  doctrines of communism, generally speaking, that is  a matter of belief?\n\n\n  \"The Witness: I think I understand your question.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Black: But you do take the position that we  do not have the right or you have no obligation to  answer the question, `Are you now a member of the  Communist party?' and that you refuse to answer.  I am not trying to argue. I just want to be sure I  understand your position. Am I correct in that?\n\n\n \"Mr. Mosk: Either way. The first question was  addressed to me. . . . [W]e are endeavoring to  address ourselves to that issue which we feel most  pertinent that is `What has Mr. Konigsberg done as  an individual with relation to the people with whom  he has dealt, the occupations and professions that he  has followed, what has he done to show affirmatively  that he is of good moral character and would be a  good member of the Bar?'\n\n\n  \"Now, as I understood Mr. Konigsberg's position  it is his feeling that one of the matters of principle \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 297]\n\u00a0\n  on which he has always stood is the principle that  one may not inquire as to a person's belief, religious,  political or otherwise, and that by answering such  questions as they are being asked throughout the  country in these days, and in all sorts of places and  under all sorts of circumstances, as I understand Mr.  Konigsberg's position that by answering such a question  he is in effect giving way to and giving ground  on the principle that one may not be asked these  things, and that by his failure to answer he is neither  affirming nor denying.\n\n\n  \"Now as to the second question, which I think is  most pertinent and certainly struck me at the moment  when I read through the transcript for the first  time, I was struck by exactly that same question, and  I asked Mr. Konigsberg about it, and I think that  perhaps he should answer this himself, but we did  discuss this very matter, and I know that his position  is now that if you were to ask the same question  today he feels that it is a question he should not  have answered, and that by way of principle in  coming unprepared he did not think through the  principle to that extent. I think I am answering  correctly.\n\n\n  \"The Witness: That is exactly what I told counsel.  As you are aware I came in without counsel, without  any preparation, without knowing exactly what I  might be asked. I did have an indication since I  had informed the Committee, I appeared before the  Tenney Committee, that I might be asked about that.  I came prepared with nothing. In the heat or in the  tension of a meeting of this kind, as you are aware,  very often one will say things that one regrets later  or would have said later. If I were asked that today  I think my answer would be the same as to the other \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 298]\n\u00a0\n  question as to whether I am or am not a member  of the Communist party, or whether I ever was.\n\n\n \"Mr. Black: I might say without expressing my  own view on the thing that I think it must be obvious  to you at least under popular conception there  is a distinction between what a man believes in a  doctrinaire's sense, which I think everybody agrees  who at least tries to follow American principles is  sacred ground as to his individual concepts. The  belief of the doctrines on the one side, and at least  in popular view, affiliation with a party that has its  policies dominated by the Soviet Union is quite a  different conception, and that the argument at least  is that inquiry goes to the very essence of a man's  loyalty to the country and has nothing to do with his  individual beliefs in the matter of religion or political  philosophy or a code of ethics, and that is the  distinction that we are trying to get at here.\n\n\n \"The Witness: I think you are quite right, and  the position you take is quite correct, and I confess  that I was in error at the time again due to the tension  of the moment, and as I was going to say I don't  think Mr. Freston's recollection is correct. I did  not say that I was giving the kind of answer, was  giving or refusing to answer because I was afraid of  a perjury charge, as I recall. That is not the basis  of refusal or the type of answer I have given. The  reason that perjury discussion came up, as I recall  now - I haven't been thinking about it - was in connection  with the nature of the hearing where a person  does not have the opportunity to cross examine  and confront witnesses or see documents or things  of that nature, and it so happens in the case of Owen  Lattimore, who faced a perjury charge, even though  he denied a half dozen ways any association with  subversive elements - I am recalling from memory - \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 299]\n\u00a0\n  it had to do with whether he expressed a certain  opinion. How is a man to remember what opinions  he expressed. His appeal is pending at the moment  for his conviction of perjury. It is only with reference  to that situation that I mentioned or commented  upon the element of perjury, because that has nothing  to do with the basis for my giving the kind of  answer I am giving to the question as to my political  affiliation, none whatsoever. You correct me on the  record if I am wrong. That is my recollection of  that discussion. At least I would like to say for the  record that has nothing to do with the type of answer  I have given.\n\n\n \"Mr. Wright: I would like to ask a question that  perhaps in some stage of this proceeding you might  enlighten at least this member of the Committee on,  whether you consider inquiry into present membership  in the Communist party as at all relevant in the  inquiries of this Committee as to moral character?  In other words, is it a relevant factor? Does it have  any bearing? Is it a proper scope of inquiry?\n\n\n \"Mr. Mosk: I think you have to draw this distinction.  It may be under some circumstances the  Committee would feel that it would be a type of  information that it would like to have to reach its  conclusion, and to that extent perhaps it may be considered  relevant, but many relevant matters are not  inquired into in legal proceedings because for other  reasons those matters are not competent testimony.  And it is the position of Mr. Konigsberg here that  inquiries into the realm of his political, religious or  other beliefs are matters that are protected under the  First Amendment to the Constitution, and therefore  while it may be information which the Committee  would feel it would like to have it is a field in which  the Committee may not inquire by Mr. Konigsberg's \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 300]\n\u00a0\n  position, and I think therefore perhaps I am answering  your question yes and no, but I think I make my  point clear as to what position Mr. Konigsberg takes.\n\n\n \"Mr. Wright: Having felt that we would like the  information and being denied, now I won't argue  with you that being denied that we have no way of  compelling it, but are we therefore faced with going  forward?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Mosk: I think that also is a fair question,  and that is why we are approaching the hearing in  the manner in which we do. . . .\n\n\n  \". . . I could, I know, bring responsible social  workers, other lawyers, persons at the universities  with whom he has dealt, all of whom are prepared  to come and say that they have known him in  these various capacities, and that on the basis of the  things that he has done himself, not what someone  else has done, but what he, Raphael Konigsberg,  has done that he is of good moral character to become  a member of the legal profession, and these are things  that as I say we will submit affirmatively, and it  seems to me that this is the affirmative answer to  what I can well understand the Committee feels is  a void which Mr. Konigsberg, for reasons of principles  he does not feel he wants to fill, but I think  that even there one must always have respect for  people who at recognizing the danger to him in standing  on his principle is still prepared to do that in order  to carry out things that he believes in so firmly.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Wright: I commend his moral principle, let  me say, but perhaps have a little doubt for his  judgment.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Mosk: If I may comment on that also I  think that certainly -\n\n\n  \"Mr. Wright: He is making it extremely hard for  the Committee.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 301]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The third, and last, hearing before the Subcommittee occurred on January 27, 1954. At this time the letters from character witnesses were presented, and there ensued general colloquy as to the scope of a memorandum to be filed by Mr. Mosk. The record shows the following as to the Subcommittee's concern over Konigsberg's refusal to answer:\n\n  \"Mr. Wright: Thank you, Mr. Mosk. I was wondering  whether or not you in the course of your  memorandum you had addressed yourself at all to  the problem of the disinclination of the applicant to  respond to questions proposed by the Committee.\n\n\n \"Mr. Mosk: I have addressed myself to that. The  memorandum, however, is not lengthy and if you  wish I would like to say just a brief word in addition  then on that point.\n\n\n \"Mr. Wright: That is one thing that frankly  bothers me that we discussed in our previous hearing.\n\n\n \"Mr. Mosk: I can understand why that is a matter  that does bother you. I think that I indicated at  the previous hearing by analogy one of the answers  that I feel is pertinent to this. I indicated, and I  feel that in every judicial proceeding and every legal  proceeding there are many matters that the tribunal  would like well to know to assist it in reaching its  conclusion.\n\n\n .  .  .  .   .\n\n\n \"Now, it is implicit in what I have said up until  now that matters of the political, economic and social  nature, matters of the mind, cannot become the  standards upon which the decision as to whether an  applicant is of good moral character can be predicated.  There are basic principles as to whether the  Committee or any other tribunal may inquire into  matters of the mind and thinking. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 302]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  \"Now, Mr. Konigsberg is obviously, as indicated  by many of these letters, and has always been a man  of great principle, and I feel that the Committee,  since it is our position that it may not inquire into  these fields must not make its decision based on Mr.  Konigsberg's principal refusal to answer questions in  a field in which the Committee may not inquire.  And this fundamentally is our answer that these are  matters which can have no bearing on his moral fitness  to practice law, and since they cannot I think it  then becomes even a greater indication of the extreme  principles upon which this man stands, and an even  greater indication that as a lawyer he will be a credit  to the legal profession.\"\n\n\n The Subcommittee having reported unfavorably, a hearing to review its recommendation was held before the full State Bar Committee on March 13, 1954, at which Konigsberg read a prepared statement, following which the record shows the following:\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: What organizations do you presently  belong to?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Mosk: To which I object on the grounds that  this is a violation of the witness's rights under the  First Amendment of the Constitution.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: You mean to say that he shouldn't  tell us whether he belongs to the Elks or the Masons  or things of that sort?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Mosk: That would be my position.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: We can't determine any organization  he belongs to? He doesn't have to answer at all?\n\n\n \"Mr. Mosk: That would be my position that his  beliefs and associations are not within the scope of  this hearing.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: It does not necessarily relate to  beliefs. We all know many organizations are not \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 303]\n\u00a0\n  based on beliefs. I think we are entitled to know  who he associates with.\n\n\n \"Mr. Konigsberg: I respectfully say that you are  not entitled to know my associations and any person  may refuse to answer on the basis of the rights of a  citizen under the First Amendment which I have  previously referred to in my testimony.\n\n\n .  .  . .  .\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: May I ask this question, Mr.  Chairman: Is it the Committee's position (and I  would sincerely like to know) that it has the power  to ask such a question and that questions relating to  opinions do have a bearing on the applicant's moral  character?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: I don't want to put it on that basis.  It is my position, not necessarily the entire Committee's  position, that we have a rather general scope of  inquiry to determine whether an applicant tells the  truth, for one thing. I think that is a factor in determining  whether or not he is morally qualified. He  may state that he is not now a Communist, if he has  been a Communist in the past, and if we believe he  is telling the truth, that will have a bearing on our  determination. I think we have the right to test the  veracity of the applicant to the extent that if he  denies that, I am influenced in the final conclusion I  will come to, that I haven't determined yet. I do  think that the applicant who wishes to afford us the  facilities for determining his moral character to the  utmost, should permit us to test his veracity.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: Mr. Chairman, in all sincerity  I have attempted to show in my initial analysis that  under Section 6064.1, that I think sets the limit to  any inquiry that any body of Examiners has. Once  you ask `Do you now?,' does that person advocate \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 304]\n\u00a0\n  the overthrow by force, violence, or other unconstitutional  means, and he answers, as I have answered,  that he does not, you cannot ask any questions about  his opinions. You are not empowered to ask any  questions. There is some question as I pointed out  in my statement whether this is constitutional even  to allow it to this extent.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: Do I understand that it is your position,  and I think I understand your position, that we  should not go ahead and find out whatever information  we can obtain in order to make the best decision?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: I make this point which I did  not make before that I don't think constitutional  such action, to draw inferences of the truth or falsity  of any statements based on the position (whether of  the First or any other Amendment) which the applicant  takes. For the Bar to maintain the position, as  the Chairman is doing, that it does have the right to  ask about my opinions (at least as he is doing this  afternoon), as I pointed out these opinions and  beliefs which have been expressed coincide with those  of prominent leaders of the Bar, which they are expressing  today . . . . I am wondering if that is the  position the Committee wishes to take.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: There is no position of the Committee.  I am only one member. We are conducting an  impartial examination.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n  \"A lady by the name of Bennett testified here.  You heard her testimony. Is there any part of that  testimony you wish to deny?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: Well, again, Mr. Chairman,  that is the same question. That is a question relating  to opinions, beliefs, political affiliations.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: It has nothing to do with beliefs. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 305]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: It certainly is related to political  organizations, political activity, however you choose  to describe it.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: Do you want to read it again?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: I recall it.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: Do you wish to deny any part?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: I wish to say that any questions  relating to such political affiliation, which the testimony  dealt with . . .\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: You refuse to affirm or deny her  testimony?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: The Committee is not empowered  to ask with regard to political affiliations or that  type . . .\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: I am calling your attention to the  fact part of it is not connected with political beliefs  or associations.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: Which part?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: You are free to read it.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: If you wish, I shall be glad to.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: If you want you may either affirm or  deny anything if you need to do that. We want to  afford you the privilege. (Witness read the testimony  referred to)\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: Mr. Chairman, I think I would  recall all the questions relating to me. She answered  a number of questions not relating to me. All relating  to me are based on a matter of political affiliation or  opinion and political association and I think that is  amply covered under the protection of the First  Amendment as I referred to a moment ago. The  Committee's rights to inquire about this matter are  limited to one, the present personal advocacy of the  overthrow by force or violence or other means as set  forth in 6064.1.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  . \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 306]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  \"Mr. O'Donnell: Are you a member of the Communist  party now?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: How does that differ from the  questions asked before?\n\n\n  \"Mr. O'Donnell: I would just like you to answer it.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: The answer is the same I would  give. The Committee is not empowered to inquire  any more than they may inquire whether I am an Elk,  a Freemason, a Democrat or a Republican. It might  become incriminating to be a member of the Democratic  party today, like saying all Democrats are  traitors.\n\n\n  \"Mr. O'Donnell: Have you ever been a member?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: I would give the same answer.\n\n\n  \"Mr. O'Donnell: You refuse to say whether you  now are?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: I refuse on the ground that the  Committee is not empowered to question anyone  about political opinions or affiliations, whether past  affiliations or present ones. I say this can have no  bearing on moral qualifications to practice law, unless  the Committee is prepared, as I said in my statement,  to take the position that it is now a crime in California  to have opinions different than general popular  opinions or conforming opinions.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: Of course, the Committee takes the  position it is doing so affirmatively, when it goes  before the Supreme Court and states you have the  proper moral character and we feel we have the right  to inquire very deeply into that because it is an  affirmative obligation on our part.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: I think, Mr. Chairman, on that  point the court has said -\n\n\n  \"Mr. Fuller: We may be wrong. The Supreme  Court may tell us otherwise but that is the way it  appears at the moment.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 307]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Finally, the Committee put to Konigsberg these questions:\n\n  \"Mr. Whitmore: It is not your contention, is it,  Mr. Konigsberg, that the only basis which the Committee  may rely on in determining whether or not it  can certify you under the provisions of 6064.1 is by  asking you the questions and getting a yes or no  answer. It is not your position that that is the  extent of the right of this body in making its determination  under 6064.1?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: In essence, that is it. My  interpretation of that code section is simply that it  sets the limit as to whatever questions relating to  opinion - because that is obviously a political issue -  there may be asked by the Bar Examiners. It sets  the limit as I interpret it. I may be wrong, as I  think the Subcommittee is wrong; because of the  history of this act as I have related it the Committee  can only ask `Do you now personally advocate the  overthrow of the government of the United States  or of this State by force or violence or other unconstitutional  means' and if I say `No,' `Yes' or whatever  it may be, that is as far as you can go; that is  without raising the question on this point (which I  don't think is pertinent) as to whether that is even  constitutional under the First Amendment.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Whitmore: You are saying that the Committee  is precluded under Section 6064.1 from considering  acts or omissions of yours in the past with  respect to that problem?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: Yes, I think so. I am saying  they can only ask do I advocate the overthrow by  force or violence or other means.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Whitmore: You are contending that we are  bound by your answer of yes or no which you give. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 308]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: You can decide for yourselves  whether I am telling the truth. You can use any  means of determining the truth. You don't have to  accept any individual's yes or no answer as the truth.  I think that is understood.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Maxfield: Doesn't your answer right there  defeat the only purpose if we can cross examine as  to the truth or falseness of that statement? Why  can't -\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: I didn't say you could cross examine  me as to the truthfulness. The question as I  understand it was whether the Committee couldn't  consider other things, records, past acts.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Whitmore: Acts or omissions.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: Anything in my record to evaluate  whether I am telling the truth, certainly.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Maxfield: The general principles of cross examination  testing the veracity of a statement, those  you know under the rules of evidence are pretty  broad. Do you deny us the right to ask these questions  for that purpose?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: Again under the rules of evidence  there might be many items of hearsay, fact  or whatever it might be, which the court would like  to know but the court prevents the prosecution or  the other side from introducing because of a deepseated  public policy or other evidentiary rule or the  First Amendment. The rule of search and seizure  is something else of that nature. The information  might be pertinent but the court says that the results  of such act, as established over the years, may not  be asked or introduced.\n\n\n  \"It is my contention as I tried to make clear - (it  might be unconstitutional, I am not questioning that  now) - it may only go as far as this law permits you  to go. The history of that act shows that the Legislature \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 309]\n\u00a0\n  tried to do other things but failed to because  it failed of passage. And a person can be asked (such  people as myself) `Do you?' than [sic] the Committee  must determine and evaluate as to the truth by  what is in the individual's record.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Maxfield: We are not entitled to an evaluation  of that truth or in an effort to evaluate it to  cross examine you with respect to present or past  associations?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Konigsberg: That is right. That is my interpretation.\"\n\n\n On February 8, 1954, the State Bar Committee refused to certify Konigsberg for admission, and the California Supreme Court denied review on April 20, 1955.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nSo ends the story. Whatever might be the conclusions to be drawn were we sitting as state judges, I am unable to understand how on this record it can be said that California violated the Federal Constitution by refusing to admit petitioner to the bar.\n\nThe members of the Committee before whom the petitioner appeared were under a statutory duty to inquire into his qualifications for admission. Among the matters into which they were obligated to inquire were moral character and the applicant's advocacy of forcible overthrow of the Government. Petitioner stated readily enough that he did not advocate overthrow of government by force, violence, or other unconstitutional means. But once that basic question was answered he took the position that the Committee's authority was exhausted; that it had no power to ask him about the facts underlying his conclusory denial or to test his response by cross-examination. The Court holds that the State's conclusion - that an applicant who so obstructs the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 310]\n\u00a0\n Committee has not met his burden of proof in establishing his qualifications of good moral character and non-advocacy of forcible overthrow - violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nI think this position is untenable. There is no conceivable reason why the Committee should not attempt by cross-examination to ascertain whether the facts squared with petitioner's bare assertion that he was qualified for admission. It can scarcely be contended that the questions were irrelevant to the matter under inquiry, namely, whether petitioner advocated forcible overthrow of the Government. At least it seems apparent to me that Communist Party membership is relevant to the question of forcible overthrow. In fact petitioner himself admitted that the questions were relevant, relying entirely on his First Amendment privilege.\n11\n Yet the Court assumes, for the purposes of this case, that the questions did not invade an area privileged under the First Amendment. In other words, we have here a refusal to answer relevant and unprivileged questions.\n\nWe are not dealing with a case where the State excludes an applicant from the bar because of bare membership, past or present, in the Communist Party. The Schware case attests that that is a wholly different question. Nor are we dealing with a case where an applicant is denied admission because of his political views. We have here a case where a state bar committee was prevented by an applicant from discharging its statutory responsibilities in further investigating the applicant's qualifications. The petitioner's refusal to answer questions in order to dispel doubts conscientiously entertained by the Committee as to his qualifications under a valid \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 311]\n\u00a0\n statutory test can, it seems to me, derive no support from the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe principle here involved is so self-evident that I should have thought it would be accepted without discussion. Can it really be said that a bar-admissions committee could not reject an applicant because he refused to reveal his past addresses, or the names of his former employers, or his criminal record? An applicant might state with the utmost sincerity that he believed that such information was none of the committee's business; yet it must be clear that his application could be rejected. And in such a case the committee would not have to point to \"evidence\" establishing either that the applicant had bad moral character or that he was asserting the constitutional privilege in bad faith. For the applicant is the moving party, and his failure to go forward is itself sufficient to support denial of admission.\n\nFor me it would at least be more understandable if the Court were to hold that the Committee's questions called for matter privileged under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. But the Court carefully avoids doing so. It seems to hold that the question of privilege is irrelevant as long as the applicant is \"in good faith\" and as long as there is other material in the record which the Court interprets as affirmatively attesting to his good moral character. I cannot agree. It is not only that we, on the basis of a bare printed record and with no opportunity to hear and observe the applicant, are in no such position as the State Bar Committee was to determine whether in fact the applicant was sincere and has a good moral character. Even were we not so disadvantaged, to make such a determination is not our function in reviewing state judgments under the Constitution. Moreover, resolution of this factual question is wholly irrelevant to the case before us, since it seems to me altogether beyond question that a \n\n[353 \nU.S. 252, 312]\n\u00a0\n State may refuse admission to its Bar to an applicant, no matter how sincere, who refuses to answer questions which are reasonably relevant to his qualifications and which do not invade a constitutionally privileged area. The opinion of the Court does not really question this; it solves the problem by denying that it exists. But what the Court has really done, I think, is simply to impose on California its own notions of public policy and judgment. For me, today's decision represents an unacceptable intrusion into a matter of state concern.\n\nFor these reasons I dissent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 6060, Cal. Bus. and Prof. Code (1937). The Court does suggest that this standard is \"unusually ambiguous\" and that it \"can be defined in an almost unlimited number of ways for any definition will necessarily reflect the attitudes, experiences, and prejudices of the definer.\" I respectfully suggest that maintenance of high professional standards requires that a State be allowed to give that term its broadest scope.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Id., 6064.1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Spears v. State Bar, 211 Cal. 183, 294 P. 697; In re Wells, 174 Cal. 467, 163 P. 657. All but 2 of the 48 States have this practice requirement. See Farley, Admission of Attorneys from Other Jurisdictions, in Survey of the Legal Profession, Bar Examinations and Requirements for Admission to the Bar, 151, 159.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Court does say: \"Prior decisions by this Court indicate that his [Konigsberg's] claim that the questions were improper was not frivolous and we find nothing in the record which indicates that his position was not taken in good faith.\" The record at least gives one pause as to the correctness of the latter conclusion. See pp. 292, 298-299, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The record contains the following exchange between Mr. O'Donnell, a member of the full State Bar Committee, and Mr. Mosk, the petitioner's counsel: \"Mr. O'Donnell: There was some suggestion that the Subcommittee was not fair at the previous hearings. Mr. Mosk: May I interrupt immediately. There was no inference in any comments made by Mr. Konigsberg or myself. They were solely directed to the decision of the Subcommittee and our disagreement with the ultimate results. The Committee was absolutely fair and treated Mr. Konigsberg and myself with the utmost degree of fairness and impartiality. We have no complaints about the Subcommittee.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Perhaps the most precise possible formulation of the question before us is whether a State may adopt a rule of administration to the effect that, in circumstances such as are disclosed here, an applicant who refuses to supply information relevant to his fitness may be deemed to have failed to sustain the burden of establishing his qualifications. I have no doubt that such a rule is constitutional. Cf. Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, \n212 \nU.S. 322, 349\n-351; Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 37 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See the italicized portions of pp. 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 295, 299, 300, 301, 303, 306, 307, 308, 309, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Even on this basis I consider today's action of the Court unjustified upon this record. Whether considered as the adoption and application of a reasonable rule of administration, or as the drawing of an adverse inference of fact, the Committee's action in this case was proper. As the Hammond case shows, a State may treat a refusal to supply relevant information as establishing facts against the refusing party even though he does not have the burden of proof. A fortiori, a State need not give affirmative relief to one who refuses to supply evidence needed to support his own claim. Cf. Moore's Federal Rules and Official Forms (1956) 163-165, taking the position that judgment should be entered against a party to civil litigation who refuses to answer relevant questions, even where the refusal is justified by a valid privilege. In this case the Court takes the position, apparently, that refusal to supply relevant information cannot justify state action in a civil proceeding even where the refusal is unprivileged, and where the refusing party is a claimant upon whom rests the burden of proof.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] There is no question here of drawing an unfavorable inference from a claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege. Petitioner repeatedly disclaimed any assertion of that privilege.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In quoting from the record I have italicized some parts to give emphasis to this point.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Cf.

UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 162\nArgued: March 6, 1957Decided: May 13, 1957\n\n\n\n\n The three petitioners were arrested by federal officers, who had an arrest warrant for only one of them. Without search warrants, the officers searched the cabin where petitioners were found, seized the entire contents of the cabin and removed them some 200 miles away for purposes of examination. Some of the evidence so seized was introduced at the trial of petitioners in a federal court, and petitioners were convicted of certain federal offenses. Held: Objections to the search and seizure were adequately raised and preserved; the search and seizure were illegal; and admission into evidence against each of the petitioners of some of the items seized in the cabin rendered the guilty verdicts illegal. Pp. 346-348.\n\n 231 F.2d 155, reversed.\n\nNorman Leonard argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioners.\n\nKevin T. Maroney argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Tompkins, Harold D. Koffsky, Philip R. Monahan and Carl G. Coben.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nOf petitioners' various contentions we find the one relating to the validity of the search and seizure made by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation dispositive of this case, and we therefore need not consider the others.\n\nThe indictment charged the three petitioners with relieving, comforting, and assisting one Thompson, a fugitive from justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 3, and with conspiring to commit that offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371. In addition, it charged petitioners Kremen and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 346, 347]\n\u00a0\n Coleman with harboring Steinberg, also a fugitive from justice, and with conspiring to commit that offense. Petitioners were found guilty, and on appeal their convictions were sustained, one judge dissenting. 231 F.2d 155. Because of the unusual character of the search and seizure here involved, we granted certiorari, without, however, limiting the writ. \n352 \nU.S. 819\n.\n\nThompson and Steinberg had been fugitives from justice for about two years when agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered them, in the company of Kremen, Coleman and another, at a secluded cabin near the village of Twain Harte, California. After keeping the cabin under surveillance for some 24 hours, the officers arrested the three petitioners and Thompson. Thompson and Steinberg were arrested outside the cabin; Kremen and Coleman, inside. The agents possessed outstanding arrest warrants for Thompson and Steinberg, but none for Kremen and Coleman. These four individuals were searched and documents found on their persons were seized. In addition, an exhaustive search of the cabin and a seizure of its entire contents were made shortly after the arrests. The agents possessed no search warrant. The property seized from the house was taken to the F. B. I. office at San Francisco for further examination. A copy of the F. B. I.'s inventory of the property thus taken is printed in the appendix to this opinion, post, p. 349.\n\nThe majority of the Court are agreed that objections to the validity of the search and seizure were adequately raised and preserved. The seizure of the entire contents of the house and its removal some two hundred miles away to the F. B. I. offices for the purpose of examination are beyond the sanction of any of our cases. While the evidence seized from the persons of the petitioners might have been legally admissible, the introduction against each of petitioners of some items seized in the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 346, 348]\n\u00a0\n house in the manner aforesaid rendered the guilty verdicts illegal. The convictions must therefore be reversed, with instructions to grant the petitioners a new trial.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE CLARK dissent,\n\n believing that the items of evidence offered and admitted into evidence were legally seized. They are of the opinion that the validity of a seizure is not to be tested by the quantity of items seized. Validity depends on the circumstances of the seizure as to each of the items that is offered into evidence. Furthermore, only a fragmentary part of the items listed by the Court as seized was admitted into evidence and if any items were illegally seized their effect should be governed by the rule of harmless error since there was ample evidence of guilt otherwise.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n   FBI INVENTORY OF PROPERTY TAKEN.\n\n\n  Personal Property and Papers\n\n\n 1 Sleeping bag with tan air mattress\n\n 1 Sleeping bag case, Kelly's of Oakland\n\n 2 Brown canvas cover, Spiro's of San Francisco\n\n 1 Skysleeper Kit bag\n\n 1 Tan zipper shaving kit containing:\n\n1 Hair brush\n\n1 Tooth brush\n\n1 Bar soap wrapped, Ivory, hotel size  bearing name Hotel Regis, corner  11th & K Streets, Sacramento,  California\n\n1 Shoelace\n\n2 Packages pipe cleaner\n\n1 Pencil flashlight battery\n\n4 Razor blades\n\n1 Package lighter flints - Ronson\n\n1 Spool fishing leader material\n\n1 Bar soap, hotel size, wrapped, with  \"Pearl\" on one side and \"Hotel  Regis\" on other\n\n 1 Plaid covered small size bag with zipper for pillow\n\n 1 Pillow, cotton filled, small, white.

HOWES LEATHER CO.(1957)\nNo. 27\nArgued: Decided: January 14, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner is a Federal District Judge who had pending before him two civil antitrust actions brought by private parties. Over a period of years, he had ruled upon many preliminary pleas and motions, requiring, in several instances, the hearing of oral arguments, the consideration of briefs and the writing of opinions and memoranda. Confronted with motions to set the cases for trial and a statement that it would take six weeks to try one of them, he sua sponte entered orders under Rule 53 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure referring both cases to a master for hearings and the preparation of findings of fact and conclusions of law. As exceptional conditions requiring the references, he cited \"an extremely congested calendar,\" the complexity of the cases and the fact that they would take considerable time to try. The Court of Appeals issued writs of mandamus requiring petitioner to vacate his orders of reference. Held: The Court of Appeals properly issued the writs of mandamus. Pp. 250-260.\n\n 1. Since the Court of Appeals could at some stage of the antitrust proceedings entertain appeals in these cases, it had discretionary power under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651 (a), in proper circumstances to issue writs of mandamus reaching them. Pp. 254-255.\n\n\n 2. In the exceptional circumstances of these cases, the Court of Appeals properly exercised its discretionary power to issue the writs of mandamus, since it was justified in finding that the orders of reference were an abuse of petitioner's power under Rule 53 (b), amounting to little less than an abdication of the judicial function and depriving the parties of trials before the court on the basic issues involved in the litigation. Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland, \n346 \nU.S. 379\n, and Parr v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 513\n, distinguished. Pp. 255-260.\n\n\n (a) The use of masters is to aid judges in the performance of specific duties as they arise in the progress of a cause - not to displace the court. P. 256. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 250]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (b) Congestion of the calendar in itself is not such an exceptional circumstance as to warrant reference to a master. P. 259.\n\n\n (c) That the cases referred had unusually complex issues of fact and law is not justification for reference to a master but rather an impelling reason for trial before a regular experienced judge. P. 259.\n\n\n (d) Nor does petitioner's claim of the great length of time these trials will require offer exceptional grounds for reference to a master. P. 259.\n\n\n (e) The detailed accounting required in order to determine the damages suffered by each plaintiff might be referred to a master after the court has determined the over-all liability of defendants, provided the circumstances indicate that the use of the court's time is not warranted in receiving the proof and making the tabulation. P. 259.\n\n\n 3. Supervisory control of the District Courts by the Courts of Appeals is necessary to proper judicial administration in the federal system; and the All Writs Act confers on the Courts of Appeals the discretionary power to issue writs of mandamus in the exceptional circumstances existing here. Pp. 259-260.\n\n\n 226 F.2d 703, affirmed.\n\nJames A. Sprowl argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Edward R. Johnston.\n\nJack I. Levy argued the cause for respondents. On the brief were Mr. Levy for Howes Leather Co., Inc., and David L. Dickson and John F. McClure for Montgomery Ward & Co., Inc., respondents.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese two consolidated cases present a question of the power of the Courts of Appeals to issue writs of mandamus to compel a District Judge to vacate his orders entered under Rule 53 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure referring antitrust cases for trial before a master. The petitioner, a United States District Judge sitting in the Northern District of Illinois, contends that the Courts of Appeals have no such power and that, even if they did, these cases were not appropriate ones for its exercise. The \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 251]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has decided unanimously that it has such power and, by a divided court, that the circumstances surrounding the references by the petitioner required it to issue the mandamus about which he complains. 226 F.2d 703. The importance of the question in the administration of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, together with the uncertainty existing on the issue among the Courts of Appeals, led to our grant of a writ of certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 964\n. We conclude that the Court of Appeals properly issued the writs of mandamus.\n\nHistory of the Litigation. - These petitions for mandamus, filed in the Court of Appeals, arose from two antitrust actions instituted in the District Court in 1950.\n1\n Rohlfing\n2\n involves 87 plaintiffs, all operators of independent retail shoe repair shops. The claim of these plaintiffs against the six named defendants - manufacturers, wholesalers, and retail mail order houses and chain operators - is identical. The claim asserted in the complaint is a conspiracy between the defendants \"to monopolize and to attempt to monopolize\" and fix the price of shoe repair supplies sold in interstate commerce in the Chicago area, in violation of the Sherman Act. The allegations also include a price discrimination charge under the Robinson-Patman Act. Shaffer\n3\n involves six plaintiffs, all wholesalers of shoe repair supplies, and six defendants, including manufacturers and wholesalers of such supplies \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 252]\n\u00a0\n and a retail shoe shop chain operator. The allegations here also include charges of monopoly and price fixing under the Sherman Act and price discrimination in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. Both complaints pray for injunctive relief, treble damages, and an accounting with respect to the discriminatory price differentials charged.\n\nThe record indicates that the cases had been burdensome to the petitioner. In Rohlfing alone, 27 pages of the record are devoted to docket entries reflecting that petitioner had conducted many hearings on preliminary pleas and motions. The original complaint had been twice amended as a result of orders of the court in regard to misjoinders and severance; 14 defendants had been dismissed with prejudice; summary judgment hearings had resulted in a refusal to enter a judgment for some of the defendants on the pleadings; over 50 depositions had been taken; and hearings to compel testimony and require the production and inspection of records were held. It appears that several of the hearings were extended and included not only oral argument but submission of briefs, and resulted in the filing of opinions and memoranda by the petitioner. It is reasonable to conclude that much time would have been saved at the trial had petitioner heard the case because of his familiarity with the litigation.\n\nThe References to the Master. - The references to the master were made under the authority of Rule 53 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n4\n The cases were called on February 23, 1955, on a motion to reset them \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 253]\n\u00a0\n for trial. Rohlfing was \"No. 1 below the black line\" on the trial list, which gave it a preferred setting. All parties were anxious for an early trial, but plaintiffs wished an adjournment until May. The petitioner announced that \"it has taken a long time to get this case at issue. I remember hearing more motions, I think, in this case than any case I have ever sat on in this court.\" The plaintiffs estimated that the trial would take six weeks, whereupon petitioner stated he did not know when he could try the case \"if it is going to take this long.\" He asked if the parties could agree \"to have a Master hear\" it. The parties ignored this query and at a conference in chambers the next day petitioner entered the orders of reference sua sponte.\n5\n The orders declared that the court was \"confronted with an extremely congested calendar\" and that \"exception [sic] conditions exist for this reason\" requiring the references. The cases were referred to the master \"to take evidence and to report the same to this Court, together with his findings of fact and conclusions of law.\" It was further ordered in each case that \"the Master shall commence the trial of this cause\" on a certain date and continue with diligence, and that the parties supply security for costs. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 254]\n\u00a0\n While the parties had deposited some $8,000 costs, the record discloses that all parties objected to the references and filed motions to vacate them. Upon petitioner's refusal to vacate the references, these mandamus actions were filed in the Court of Appeals seeking the issuance of writs ordering petitioner to do so. These applications were grounded on 28 U.S.C. 1651 (a), the All Writs Act.\" In his answer to the show cause orders issued by the Court of Appeals, petitioner amplified the reasons for the references, stating \"that the cases were very complicated and complex, that they would take considerable time to try,\" and that his \"calendar was congested.\" Declaring that the references amounted to \"a refusal on his [petitioner's] part, as a judge, to try the causes in due course,\" the Court of Appeals concluded that \"in view of the extraordinary nature of these causes\" the references must be vacated \"if we find that the orders were beyond the court's power under the pertinent rule.\" 226 F.2d, at 705, 706. And, it being so found, the writs issued under the authority of the All Writs Act. It is not disputed that the same principles and considerations as to the propriety of the issuance of the writs apply equally to the two cases.\n\nThe Power of the Courts of Appeals. - Petitioner contends that the power of the Courts of Appeals does not extend to the issuance of writs of mandamus to review interlocutory orders except in those cases where the review of the case on appeal after final judgment would be frustrated. Asserting that the orders of reference were in exercise of his jurisdiction under Rule 53 (b), petitioner urges that such action can be reviewed only on appeal and not by writ of mandamus, since by congressional \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 255]\n\u00a0\n enactment appellate review of a District Court's orders may be had only after a final judgment. The question of naked power has long been settled by this Court. As late as Roche v. Evaporated Milk Association, \n319 \nU.S. 21\n (1943), Mr. Chief Justice Stone reviewed the decisions and, in considering the power of Courts of Appeals to issue writs of mandamus, the Court held that \"the common law writs, like equitable remedies, may be granted or withheld in the sound discretion of the court.\" Id., at 25. The recodification of the All Writs Act in 1948, which consolidated old 342 and 377 into the present 1651 (a), did not affect the power of the Courts of Appeals to issue writs of mandamus in aid of jurisdiction. See Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland, \n346 \nU.S. 379, 382\n-383 (1953). Since the Court of Appeals could at some stage of the antitrust proceedings entertain appeals in these cases, it has power in proper circumstances, as here, to issue writs of mandamus reaching them. Roche, supra, at 25, and cases there cited. This is not to say that the conclusion we reach on the facts of this case is intended, or can be used, to authorize the indiscriminate use of prerogative writs as a means of reviewing interlocutory orders. We pass on, then, to the only real question involved, i. e., whether the exercise of the power by the Court of Appeals was proper in the cases now before us.\n\nThe Discretionary Use of the Writs. - It appears from the docket entries to which we heretofore referred that the petitioner was well informed as to the nature of the antitrust litigation, the pleadings of the parties, and the gist of the plaintiffs' claims. He was well aware of the theory of the defense and much of the proof which necessarily was outlined in the various requests for discovery, admissions, interrogatories, and depositions. He heard arguments on motions to dismiss, to compel testimony on depositions, and for summary judgment. In fact, petitioner's \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 256]\n\u00a0\n knowledge of the cases at the time of the references, together with his long experience in the antitrust field, points to the conclusion that he could dispose of the litigation with greater dispatch and less effort than anyone else. Nevertheless, he referred both suits to a master on the general issue. Furthermore, neither the existence of the alleged conspiracy nor the question of liability vel non had been determined in either case. These issues, as well as the damages, if any, and the question concerning the issuance of an injunction, were likewise included in the references. Under all of the circumstances, we believe the Court of Appeals was justified in finding the orders of reference were an abuse of the petitioner's power under Rule 53 (b). They amounted to little less than an abdication of the judicial function depriving the parties of a trial before the court on the basic issues involved in the litigation.\n\nThe use of masters is \"to aid judges in the performance of specific judicial duties, as they may arise in the progress of a cause,\" Ex parte Peterson, \n253 \nU.S. 300, 312\n (1920), and not to displace the court. The exceptional circumstances here warrant the use of the extraordinary remedy of mandamus. See Maryland v. Soper, \n270 \nU.S. 9, 30\n (1926). As this Court pointed out in Los Angeles Brush Corp. v. James, \n272 \nU.S. 701, 706\n (1927): \". . . [W]here the subject concerns the enforcement of the . . . [r]ules which by law it is the duty of this Court to formulate and put in force,\" mandamus should issue to prevent such action thereunder so palpably improper as to place it beyond the scope of the rule invoked. As was said there at page 707, were the Court \". . . to find that the rules have been practically nullified by a district judge . . . it would not hesitate to restrain [him]. . . .\" The Los Angeles Brush Corp. case was cited as authority in 1940 for a per curiam opinion in McCullough v. Cosgrave, \n309 \nU.S. 634\n, in which the Court summarily \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 257]\n\u00a0\n ordered vacated the reference of two patent cases to a master. The cases arose from the same District Court in which the Los Angeles Brush Corp. case originated and the grounds for the references largely followed that case. It is to be noted that the grounds there are much more inclusive than those set out here, alleging all of those claimed by the petitioner and, in addition, the prolonged illness of the regular judge and the fact that no other judge was available to try the cases. It appears to us a fortiori that these cases were improperly referred to a master.\n\nIt is claimed that recent opinions of this Court are to the contrary. Petitioner cites Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland, \n346 \nU.S. 379\n (1953), and Parr v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 513\n (1956). The former case did not concern rules promulgated by this Court but, rather, an Act of Congress, the venue statute. Furthermore, there we pointed out that the \". . . All Writs Act is meant to be used only in the exceptional case where there is clear abuse of discretion or `usurpation of judicial power'. . . .\" \n346 \nU.S., at 383\n. Certainly, as the Court of Appeals found here, there was a clear abuse of discretion. In the Parr case, the District Court had not exceeded or refused to exercise its functions. It dismissed an indictment because the Government had elected to prosecute Parr in another district under a new indictment. The effect of the holding was merely that the dismissal of the first indictment was not an abuse of the discretion vested in the trial judge.\n\nIt is also contended that the Seventh Circuit has erroneously construed the All Writs Act as \"conferring on it a `roving commission' to supervise interlocutory orders of the District Courts in advance of final decision.\" Our examination of its opinions in this regard leads us to the conclusion that the Court of Appeals has exercised commendable self-restraint. It is true that mandamus should \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 258]\n\u00a0\n be resorted to only in extreme cases, since it places trial judges in the anomalous position of being litigants without counsel other than uncompensated volunteers. However, there is an end of patience and it clearly appears that the Court of Appeals has for years admonished the trial judges of the Seventh Circuit that the practice of making references \"does not commend itself\" and \". . . should seldom be made, and if at all only when unusual circumstances exist.\" In re Irving-Austin Building Corp., 100 F.2d 574, 577 (1938). Again, in 1942, it pointed out that the words \"exception\" and \"exceptional\" as used in the reference rule are not elastic terms with the trial court the sole judge of their elasticity. \"Litigants are entitled to a trial by the court, in every suit, save where exceptional circumstances are shown.\" Adventures in Good Eating, Inc. v. Best Places to Eat, Inc., 131 F.2d 809, 815. Still the Court of Appeals did not disturb the reference practice by reversal or mandamus until this case was decided in October 1955. Again, Chief Judge Duffy in Krinsley v. United Artists Corp., 235 F.2d 253, 257 (1956), in which there was an affirmance of a case involving a reference, called attention to the fact that the practice of referring cases to masters was \". . . all too common in the Northern District of Illinois . . . .\" The record does not show to what extent references are made by the full bench of the District Court in the Northern District; however, it does reveal that petitioner has referred 11 cases to masters in the past 6 years. But even \"a little cloud may bring a flood's downpour\" if we approve the practice here indulged, particularly in the face of presently congested dockets, increased filings, and more extended trials. This is not to say that we are neither aware of nor fully appreciative of the unfortunate congestion of the court calendar in many of our District Courts. The use of procedural devices in the heavily congested districts has proven to be most helpful in reducing docket congestion. Illustrative \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 259]\n\u00a0\n of such techniques are provision for an assignment commissioner to handle the assignment of all cases; the assignment of judges to handle only motions, pleas, and pre trial proceedings; and separate calendars for civil and criminal trials in cases that have reached issue. We enumerate these merely as an example of the progress made in judicial administration through the use of enlightened procedural techniques. It goes without saying that they can be used effectively only where adaptable to the specific problems of a district. But, be that as it may, congestion in itself is not such an exceptional circumstance as to warrant a reference to a master. If such were the test, present congestion would make references the rule rather than the exception. Petitioner realizes this, for in addition to calendar congestion he alleges that the cases referred had unusual complexity of issues of both fact and law. But most litigation in the antitrust field is complex. It does not follow that antitrust litigants are not entitled to a trial before a court. On the contrary, we believe that this is an impelling reason for trial before a regular, experienced trial judge rather than before a temporary substitute appointed on an ad hoc basis and ordinarily not experienced in judicial work. Nor does petitioner's claim of the great length of time these trials will require offer exceptional grounds. The final ground asserted by petitioner was with reference to the voluminous accounting which would be necessary in the event the plaintiffs prevailed. We agree that the detailed accounting required in order to determine the damages suffered by each plaintiff might be referred to a master after the court has determined the over-all liability of defendants, provided the circumstances indicate that the use of the court's time is not warranted in receiving the proof and making the tabulation.\n\nWe believe that supervisory control of the District Courts by the Courts of Appeals is necessary to proper \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 260]\n\u00a0\n judicial administration in the federal system. The All Writs Act confers on the Courts of Appeals the discretionary power to issue writs of mandamus in the exceptional circumstances existing here. Its judgment is therefore.\n\n    Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rohlfing v. Cat's Paw Rubber Co., No. 50 C 229, U.S. D.C. N. D. Ill., and Shaffer v. U.S. Rubber Co., No. 50 C 844, U.S. D.C. N. D. Ill.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The figures indicated refer to the number of parties at the time of the petition for mandamus. When the action was originally filed there were 87 plaintiffs and 25 defendants.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The figures indicated refer to the number of parties at the time of the petition for mandamus. When the action was originally filed there were 10 plaintiffs and 20 defendants.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Rule 53 (b) provides:\n\n\"(b) REFERENCE. A reference to a master shall be the exception and not the rule. In actions to be tried by a jury, a reference shall be made only when the issues are complicated: in actions to be tried without a jury, save in matters of account, a reference shall be made only upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires it.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The fact that the master is an active practitioner would make the comment of Chief Justice Vanderbilt with regard to the effect of references appropriate here. In his work, Cases and Materials on Modern Procedure and Judicial Administration (1952), at pages 1240-1241, he states:\n\n\"There is one special cause of delay in getting cases on for trial that must be singled out for particular condemnation, the all-too-prevalent habit of sending matters to a reference. There is no more effective way of putting a case to sleep for an indefinite period than to permit it to go to a reference with a busy lawyer as referee. Only a drastic administrative rule, rigidly enforced, strictly limiting the matters in which a reference may be had and requiring weekly reports as to the progress of each reference will put to rout this inveterate enemy of dispatch in the trial of cases.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] \"(a) The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nThe issue here is not whether Judge La Buy's order was reviewable by the Court of Appeals. The sole question is whether review should have awaited final decision in the cause or whether the order was reviewable before final decision by way of a petition under the All Writs Act for the issuance of a writ of mandamus addressed to it. I do not agree that the writ directing Judge La Buy to vacate the order of reference was within the bounds of the discretionary power of the Court of Appeals to issue an extraordinary writ under the All Writs Act.\n1\n Only last Term, in Parr v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 513\n, this Court restated those bounds:\n\n\"The power to issue them is discretionary and it is sparingly exercised. . . . This is not a case where a court has exceeded or refused to exercise its jurisdiction, see Roche v. Evaporated Milk Assn., \n319 \nU.S. 21, 26\n, nor one where appellate review will be defeated if a writ does not issue, cf. Maryland v. Soper, \n270 \nU.S. 9, 29\n-30. Here the most that could be claimed is that the district courts have erred in ruling on matters within their jurisdiction. The extraordinary \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 261]\n\u00a0\n writs do not reach to such cases; they may not be used to thwart the congressional policy against piecemeal appeals. Roche v. Evaporated Milk Assn., supra, at p. 30.\" \n351 \nU.S., at 520\n.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n The action of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit here under review is outside these limitations. The case before the Court of Appeals was \"not a case where a court has exceeded or refused to exercise its jurisdiction. . . .\" Rule 53 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure vested Judge La Buy with discretionary power to make a reference if he found, and he did, that \"some exceptional condition\" required the reference.\n3\n Here also \"the most that could be claimed is that the district [court] . . . erred in ruling on matters within [its] jurisdiction.\" If Judge La Buy erred in finding that there was an \"exceptional condition\" requiring the reference or did not give proper weight to the caveat of the Rule that a \"reference to a master shall be the exception and not the rule,\" that was mere error \"in ruling on matters within [the District Court's] jurisdiction.\" Such mere error does not bring into play the power of the Court of Appeals to issue an extraordinary writ. Nor did Judge \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 262]\n\u00a0\n La Buy's order of reference present the Court of Appeals with a case \"where appellate review will be defeated if a writ does not issue.\" The litigants may suffer added expense and possible delay in obtaining a decision as a consequence of the reference, but Roche settles that \"that inconvenience is one which we must take it Congress contemplated in providing that only final judgments should be reviewable.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\nBut, regrettable as is this Court's approval of what I consider to be a clear departure by the Court of Appeals from the settled principles governing the issuance of the extraordinary writs, what this Court says in reaching its result is reason for particularly grave concern. I think this Court has today seriously undermined the longstanding statutory policy against piecemeal appeals. My brethren say: \"Since the Court of Appeals could at some stage of the antitrust proceedings entertain appeals in these cases, it has power in proper circumstances, as here, to issue writs of mandamus reaching them. . . . This is not to say that the conclusion we reach on the facts of this case is intended, or can be used, to authorize the indiscriminate use of prerogative writs as a means of reviewing interlocutory orders.\" I understand this to mean that proper circumstances are present for the issuance of a writ in this case because, if the litigants are not now heard, the Court of Appeals will not have an opportunity to relieve them of the burden of the added expense and delay of decision alleged to be the consequence of the reference. But that bridge was crossed by this Court in Roche and Alkali, where this very argument was rejected: \"Here the inconvenience to the litigants results alone from the circumstance that Congress has provided for review of the district court's order only on review of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 263]\n\u00a0\n the final judgment, and not from an abuse of judicial power, or refusal to exercise it, which it is the function of mandamus to correct.\" \n319 \nU.S., at 31\n.\n\nWhat this Court is saying, therefore, is that the All Writs Act confers an independent appellate power in the Courts of Appeals to review interlocutory orders. I have always understood the law to be precisely to the contrary. The power granted to the Courts of Appeals by the All Writs Act is not an appellate power but merely an auxiliary power in aid of and to protect the appellate jurisdiction conferred by other provisions of law, e. g., the power to review final decisions granted by 28 U.S.C. 1291, \n5\n and to review specified exceptional classes of interlocutory orders granted by 28 U.S.C. 1292.\n6\n This holding that an independent appellate power is given by the All Writs Act not only discards the constraints upon the scope of the power to issue extraordinary writs restated in Parr, but, by the very fact of doing so, opens wide the crack in the door which, since the Judiciary Act of 1789, has shut out from intermediate appellate review all interlocutory actions of the District Courts not within the few exceptional classes now specified by the Congress in 1292.\n\nThe power of the Courts of Appeals to issue extraordinary writs stems from 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n7\n Chief Judge Magruder, in In re Josephson, 218 F.2d 174, provides us with an invaluable history of this power and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 264]\n\u00a0\n of the judicial development of its scope. He demonstrates most persuasively that \"[t]he all writs section does not confer an independent appellate power; the power is strictly of an auxiliary nature, in aid of a jurisdiction granted in some other provision of law, as was sharply pointed out in Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass'n, 1943, \n319 \nU.S. 21, 29\n-31 . . . .\" 218 F.2d, at 180.\n\nThe focal question posed for a Court of Appeals by a petition for the issuance of a writ is whether the action of the District Court tends to frustrate or impede the ultimate exercise by the Court of Appeals of its appellate jurisdiction granted in some other provision of the law. The answer is clearly in the affirmative where, for example, the order of the District Court transfers a cause to a District Court of another circuit for decision. That was Josephson, where the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that an order of a District Court in the circuit transferring a case to the District Court of another circuit was within the reach of the Court of Appeals' power under the All Writs Act because \"the effect of the order is that the district judge has declined to proceed with the determination of a case which could eventually come to this court by appeal from a `final decision'.\"\n8\n 218 F.2d, at 181. In contrast, a District Court order denying a transfer would not come under the umbrella of power under the All Writs Act, since retention of the cause by the District Court can hardly thwart or tend to defeat the power of the Court of Appeals to review that order after final decision of the case. The distinction between the grant and denial of transfer was recognized in Carr v. Donohoe, 201 F.2d 426, where the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied a petition for writ of mandamus directed to an order of a District Court transferring the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 265]\n\u00a0\n cause to another District Court within the same circuit. The Court of Appeals properly noted that the order was merely a nonappealable interlocutory order in nowise impairing its actual or potential jurisdiction to review that and any other action after final decision, observing: \"It seems obvious that the transfer of the . . . action . . . to [another district in the same circuit] cannot in any way impair or defeat the jurisdiction of this Court to review any appealable order or judgment which eventually may be entered in the case.\"\n9\n 201 F.2d, at 428-429.\n\nThis Court's reliance upon Los Angeles Brush Corp. v. James, \n272 \nU.S. 701\n, and McCullough v. Cosgrave, \n309 \nU.S. 634\n, is, in my opinion, misplaced. Those cases involved the power, not of the Courts of Appeals, but of this Court, to issue extraordinary writs. In Josephson, Chief Judge Magruder took pains to emphasize the \"caution that decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, at least prior to 1948, supporting the issuance, by that Court, of a writ of mandamus directed to a lower federal court, may not safely be relied upon by an intermediate court of appeals as authority for the issuance by the latter court of a writ of mandamus directed to a district court within the circuit. The reason is that the Supreme Court might have been exercising a different sort of power from the strictly auxiliary power given to us under the all writs section.\" 218 F.2d, at 179. This \"different sort of power\" derived from 13 of the Judiciary \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 266]\n\u00a0\n Act of 1789, granting the Supreme Court power to issue writs of mandamus \"in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law.\"\n10\n This provision, unlike the All Writs Act, was not restricted in its use to aiding the jurisdiction of the appellate court, and therefore might be deemed to have granted a broader power to this Court than that conferred on the Courts of Appeals by the latter statute.\n\nFurthermore, Los Angeles Brush Corp. was a case where a reference was made, not because a district judge decided that the particular circumstances of the particular case required a reference, but pursuant to an agreement among all the judges of that District Court always to appoint masters to hear patent cases regardless of the circumstances of particular cases. The McCullough situation was much the same. As that case was delimited in Roche, this Court was there confronted by a case of \"the persistent disregard of the Rules of Civil Procedure prescribed by this Court.\" \n319 \nU.S., at 31\n.\n\nThe key to both Los Angeles Brush Corp. and McCullough is found in the language in the former in \n272 \nU.S., at 706\n:\n\n \". . . we think it clear that where the subject concerns the enforcement of the Equity Rules which by law it is the duty of this Court to formulate and put in force, and in a case in which this Court has the ultimate discretion to review the case on its merits, it may use its power of mandamus and deal directly with the District Court in requiring it to conform to them.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n In other words, neither of those cases can be accepted as supporting what the Court of Appeals undertook to do here, both because of the absence in old 234 of the \"in aid of\" jurisdiction limitation now contained in 1651, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 267]\n\u00a0\n and of anything approaching a wholesale disregard of the rules prescribed by this Court, such as was involved there. I subscribe fully to Chief Judge Magruder's conclusion in Josephson:\n\n \"Contrary to the view which seems to have been occasionally taken, or at least sub silentio assumed, in other courts of appeals, we do not think that 28 U.S.C. 1651 [the All Writs Act] grants us a general roving commission to supervise the administration of justice in the federal district courts within our circuit, and in particular to review by a writ of mandamus any unappealable order which we believe should be immediately reviewable in the interest of justice.\" 218 F.2d, at 177.\n\n\n The view now taken by this Court that the All Writs Act confers an independent appellate power, although not so broad as \"to authorize the indiscriminate use of prerogative writs as a means of reviewing interlocutory orders,\" in effect engrafts upon federal appellate procedure a standard of interlocutory review never embraced by the Congress throughout our history, although it is written into the English Judicature Act\n11\n and is followed in varying degrees in some of the States.\n12\n That standard allows interlocutory appeals by leave of the appellate court. It is a compromise between conflicting viewpoints as to the extent that interlocutory appeals should be allowed.\n13\n The federal policy of limited interlocutory \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 268]\n\u00a0\n review stresses the inconvenience and expense of piecemeal reviews and the strong public interest in favor of a single and complete trial with a single and complete review. The other view, of which the New York practice of allowing interlocutory review as of right from most orders is the extreme example, perceives danger of possible injustice in individual cases from the denial of any appellate review until after judgment at the trial.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nThe polestar of federal appellate procedure has always been \"finality,\" meaning that appellate review of most interlocutory actions must await final determination of the cause at the trial level. \"Finality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure. It was written into the first Judiciary Act and has been departed from only when observance of it would practically defeat the right to any review at all.\" Cobbledick v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 323, 324\n-325. The Court's action today shatters that statutory policy. I protest, not only because we invade a domain reserved by the Constitution exclusively to the Congress,\n15\n but as well because the encouragement to interlocutory appeals offered by this decision must necessarily aggravate further the already bad condition of calendar congestion in some of our District Courts and also add to the burden of work of some of our busiest Courts of Appeals. More petitions for interlocutory review, requiring the attention of the Courts of Appeals, add, of course, to the burden of work of those courts. Meanwhile final decision of the cases concerned is delayed while the District Courts mark time awaiting action upon the petitions. Rarely does determination upon interlocutory review terminate the litigation. Moreover, the District Court calendars become longer with the addition of new cases before older ones \n\n[352 \nU.S. 249, 269]\n\u00a0\n are decided. This, then, interposes one more obstacle to the strong effort being made to better justice through improved judicial administration.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nThe power of the Court of Appeals to correct any error in Judge La Buy's reference is found exclusively in the power to review final decisions under 1291. The Court of Appeals erred by assuming a nonexistent power under the All Writs Act to review this interlocutory order in advance of final decision. Insofar as the Court approves this error, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"(a) The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\" 28 U.S.C. 1651 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf.

If the federal rule required a like consent by a chief judge, a reference without such consent would be outside the jurisdiction of the District Court, and, therefore, subject to correction by writ of mandamus. The vital distinction is that the federal rule as presently framed vests discretion in the District Courts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \n319 \nU.S., at 30\n. Cf. United States Alkali Export Assn. v.

The union gave notice of proposed amendments 60 days in advance of October 23, and a strike occurred long after that date, though without further notice of termination of the contract. Held:\n\n 1. The notice and waiting requirements of 8 (d) were fully satisfied; the strike did not violate 8 (d) (4); and the strikers did not lose their status as employees entitled to the protection of the Act.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn this case we are called upon again to interpret 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n See Mastro Plastics Corp. v. Labor Board, \n350 \nU.S. 270\n. In particular we are concerned with 8 (d) (4), which provides that a party who wishes to modify or terminate \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 285]\n\u00a0\n a collective bargaining contract must continue \"in full force and effect, without resorting to strike or lockout, all the terms and conditions of the existing contract for a period of sixty days after . . . notice [of his wish to modify or terminate] is given or until the expiration date of such contract, whichever occurs later.\" Since 8 (d) defines the duty to bargain collectively, a violation of 8 (d) (4) constitutes a refusal to bargain, an unfair labor practice for employers, 8 (a) (5), and unions, 8 (b) (3). The last sentence of 8 (d) contains an additional sanction: an employee who strikes within the specified 60-day period loses his status as an employee for the purposes of 8, 9 and 10 of the Act. The sole question presented by the petition for certiorari is:\n\nWhether the requirement of this Section is satisfied where a contract provides for negotiation and adoption of modifications at an intermediate date during its term, and a strike in support of modification demands occurs after the date on which such modifications may become effective - and after the 60-day notice period has elapsed - but prior to the terminal date of the contract.\n\n\n We are told by the Solicitor General that the question is of major importance in the negotiation and administration of hundreds of collective bargaining agreements throughout the country; that there is a decided trend among unions and employers to execute contracts of longer duration than formerly and to include provisions for reopening to negotiate changes during the contract term.\n2\n Because of the importance of the question, we granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 986\n, to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to the effect that 8 (d) (4) bans strikes to obtain modifications of a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n contract until the contract by its terms or by the action of the parties has terminated.\n\nOn October 23, 1950, respondent Lion Oil Co. and the Oil Workers International Union, CIO, entered into a contract which provided:\n\n \"This agreement shall remain in full force and effect for the period beginning October 23, 1950, and ending October 23, 1951, and thereafter until canceled in the manner hereinafter in this Article provided.\n\n\n \"This agreement may be canceled and terminated by the Company or the Union as of a date subsequent to October 23, 1951, by compliance with the following procedure:\n\n\n \"(a) If either party to this agreement desires to amend the terms of this agreement, it shall notify the other party in writing of its desire to that effect, by registered mail. No such notice shall be given prior to August 24, 1951. Within the period of 60 days, immediately following the date of the receipt of said notice by the party to which notice is so delivered, the Company and the Union shall attempt to agree as to the desired amendments to this agreement.\n\n\n \"(b) If an agreement with respect to amendment of this agreement has not been reached within the 60-day period mentioned in the sub-section immediately preceding, either party may terminate this agreement thereafter upon not less than sixty days' written notice to the other. Any such notice of termination shall state the date upon which the termination of this agreement shall be effective.\"\n\n\n On August 24, 1951, the union served written notice on the company of its desire to modify the contract.\n3\n Negotiations \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n began on the contractual changes proposed by the union. The union members voted for a strike on February 14, 1952, but the strike, thrice postponed as negotiations continued, did not actually begin until April 30, 1952. The union never gave notice to terminate the contract as contemplated by the quoted contractual provision. Therefore, at all relevant times a collective bargaining agreement was in effect. On August 3, a new contract was executed, and the strikers began to return to work the following day. Certain actions of the company during the strike were the basis of unfair labor practice charges by the union upon which a complaint issued.\n\nThe Labor Board found that the company was guilty of unfair labor practices under 8 (a) (1), (3) and (5) of the Act. The company defended on the ground that the strike, because it occurred while the contract was in effect, was in violation of 8 (d) (4). A majority of the Board rejected this defense, holding that\n\n\"The term `expiration date' as used in Section 8 (d) (4). . . has a twofold meaning; it connotes not only the terminal date of a bargaining contract, but also an agreed date in the course of its existence when the parties can effect changes in its provisions.\"\n\n\n The Board held that since, under the contract in dispute, October 23, 1951, was such an \"agreed date,\" the notice given August 24 followed by a wait of more than 60 days satisfied the statute. The company was ordered to cease and desist and, affirmatively, to make whole employees found to have been discriminated against. 109 N. L. R. B. 680, 683.\n\nOn the company's petition for review, the Court of Appeals set aside the Board's order. 221 F.2d 231. The court held that the \"expiration date\" of the contract was the date on which all rights and obligations under it would \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 288]\n\u00a0\n cease; that the second notice required to bring about this termination not having been given, the strike violated 8 (d) (4) and the strikers therefore lost their status as employees entitled to the protection of the Act.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIn Mastro Plastics Corp. v. Labor Board, supra, we had before us another provision of 8 (d). What we said there in ruling out a narrowly literal construction of the words of the statute is equally apropos here. \"If the above words are read in complete isolation from their context in the Act, such an interpretation is possible. However, `In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.' United States v. Boisdore's Heirs, 8 How. 113, 122.\" \n350 \nU.S., at 285\n. Moreover, in Mastro Plastics we cautioned against accepting a construction that \"would produce incongruous results.\" Id., at 286.\n\nThat 8 (d) (4) is susceptible of various interpretations is apparent when 8 (d) is read as a whole. Its ambiguity was recognized by the Joint Committee of Congress created by the very act of which 8 (d) was a part to study the operation of the federal labor laws.\n5\n Members of the National Labor Relations Board, the agency specially charged by Congress with effectuating the purposes of the national labor legislation, have expressed divergent views on the proper construction of 8 (d) (4); none of them has taken the position adopted \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 289]\n\u00a0\n by the court below.\n6\n In the face of this ambiguity it will not do simply to say Congress could have made itself clearer and automatically equate the phrase \"expiration date\" only with the date when a contract comes to an end.\n\nWe find our guide to the general context of the statute in Mastro Plastics. In that case we recognized a \"dual purpose\" in the Taft-Hartley Act - to substitute collective bargaining for economic warfare and to protect the right of employees to engage in concerted activities for their own benefit. \n350 \nU.S., at 284\n. A construction which serves neither of these aims is to be avoided unless the words Congress has chosen clearly compel it. The restriction on employees' concerted activities which would result from the construction placed upon 8 (d) (4) by the Court of Appeals is obvious.\n7\n Too, we think it would discourage the development of long-term bargaining relationships. Unions would be wary of entering into long-term contracts with machinery for reopening them for modification from time to time, if they thought the right to strike would be denied them for the entire term of such a contract, though they imposed no such limitations on themselves.\n\nWe do not believe that the language used by Congress requires any such result. Section 8 (d) (1) provides that \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 290]\n\u00a0\n no party to an existing collective bargaining contract \"shall terminate or modify such contract, unless the party desiring such termination or modification - (1) serves a written notice upon the other party to the contract of the proposed termination or modification sixty days prior to the expiration date thereof. . . .\" The phrase \"expiration date\" is repeated in 8 (d) (1) and again in the \"whichever occurs later\" clause of 8 (d) (4) upon which this case turns. The use of the three words \"termination,\" \"modification\" and \"expiration\" is significant. We conceive that a notice of desired modification would typically be served in advance of the date when the contract by its own terms was subject to modification. Notice of desired termination would ordinarily precede the date when the contract would come to an end by its terms or would be automatically renewed in the absence of notice to terminate. Therefore we conclude that Congress meant by \"expiration date\" in 8 (d) (1) to encompass both situations, and the same phrase in 8 (d) (4) must carry the same meaning. \"Expiration\" has no such fixed and settled meaning as to make this an unduly strained reading.\n\nOur conclusion is buttressed by a provision of 8 (d) which was added by the Conference Committee.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\"[T]he duties. . . imposed [by subsections (2), (3) and (4)] shall not be construed as requiring either party to discuss or agree to any modification of the terms and conditions contained in a contract for a fixed period, if such modification is to become effective before such terms and conditions can be reopened under the provisions of the contract.\"\n\n\n The negative implication seems clear: Congress recognized a duty to bargain over modifications when the contract \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 291]\n\u00a0\n itself contemplates such bargaining. It would be anomalous for Congress to recognize such a duty and at the same time deprive the union of the strike threat which, together with \"the occasional strike itself, is the force depended upon to facilitate arriving at satisfactory settlements.\"\n9\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough a 1948 committee report is no part of the legislative history of a statute enacted in 1947, we note that the Joint Committee on Labor-Management Relations, made up of members of the Congress which passed the Taft-Hartley Act, in its final report reached the same conclusion we do:\n\n \"Reading section 8 (d) as a whole seems to lead to the conclusion that the act permits a strike, after a 60-day notice, in the middle of a contract which authorizes a reopening on wages. Use of the words `or modify' and `or modification' in the proviso, and use of `or modification' in section 8 (d) (1), and the statement in the final paragraph of the section that the parties are not required to agree to any modification effective before the contract may be reopened under its terms, all seem to contemplate the right of either party to insist on changes in the contract if they have so provided. The right of the union would be an empty one without the right to strike after a 60-day notice.\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 292]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The contemporary legislative history manifests no real recognition of the problem before us.\n11\n A reading of the committee reports and the floor debates alone could well lead to the conclusion that both the sponsors and the opponents of the bill saw in 8 (d) (4) no more than a means for preventing \"quickie\" strikes by requiring a \"cooling-off\" period which would not in any circumstances exceed 60 days.\n12\n But the language used in the statute goes beyond this limited purpose. Significance must be given to the clause, \"or until the expiration date of such contract, whichever occurs later.\" We believe our construction gives meaning to the congressional language which accords with the general purpose of the Act.\n\nApplying that construction to the facts of this case, we hold that the notice and waiting requirements of 8 (d) were fully satisfied. October 23, 1951, was the first date upon which the contract by its terms was subject to amendment. Notice of proposed amendments was served 60 days in advance. The strike did not occur until long afterward. The fact that on October 23 the contract became terminable upon further notice by either party is immaterial. One thing the most authoritative legislative gloss on 8 (d), the report of the Senate Committee, makes clear is that the statutory notice \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 293]\n\u00a0\n requirement operates wholly independently of whatever notice requirement the parties have fixed for themselves.\n13\n The situation here is not different, so far as the applicability of the statute is concerned, from that of a fixed-term contract with a clause providing for reopening at some specific time.\n\nNor can we accept respondents' alternative contention that, even apart from 8 (d), the strike was in breach of contract and the strikers were for that reason not entitled to relief at the hand of the Board. Respondents rely upon Labor Board v. Sands Mfg. Co., \n306 \nU.S. 332\n. In Sands, as in this case, the contract did not contain an express no-strike clause. Employees there refused in the course of the contract to continue work \"in accordance with their contract.\" Id., at 344. The refusal occurred midway in a fixed-term contract which did not provide for modifications during its term. This Court sustained the propriety of the employer's action in discharging the employees. Here the strike occurred at a time when the parties were bargaining over modifications after notice and in accordance with the terms of the contract. Where there has been no express waiver of the right to strike,\n14\n a waiver of the right during such a period is not to be inferred. We do not believe that the two-phase provision for terminating this contract means that it was not within the contemplation of the parties that \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 294]\n\u00a0\n economic weapons might be used to support demands for modification before the notice to terminate was given.\n\nThe judgment below is reversed and the case remanded for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"SEC. 8. . . .\n\n\"(d) For the purposes of this section, to bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder, and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession: Provided, That where there is in effect a collective-bargaining contract covering employees in an \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n industry affecting commerce, the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that no party to such contract shall terminate or modify such contract, unless the party desiring such termination or modification -\n\n\n\"(1) serves a written notice upon the other party to the contract of the proposed termination or modification sixty days prior to the expiration date thereof, or in the event such contract contains no expiration date, sixty days prior to the time it is proposed to make such termination or modification;\n\n\n\"(2) offers to meet and confer with the other party for the purpose of negotiating a new contract or a contract containing the proposed modification;\n\n\n\"(3) notifies the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service within thirty days after such notice of the existence of a dispute, and simultaneously therewith notifies any State or Territorial agency established to mediate and conciliate disputes within the State or Territory where the dispute occurred, provided no agreement has been reached by that time; and\n\n\n\"(4) continues in full force and effect, without resorting to strike or lock-out, all the terms and conditions of the existing contract for a period of sixty days after such notice is given or until the expiration date of such contract, whichever occurs later:\n\n\n The duties imposed upon employers, employees, and labor organizations by paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) shall become inapplicable upon an intervening certification of the Board, under which the labor organization or individual, which is a party to the contract, has been superseded as or ceased to be the representative of the employees subject to the provisions of section 9 (a), and the duties so imposed shall not be construed as requiring either party to discuss or agree to any modification of the terms and conditions contained in a contract for a fixed period, if such modification is to become effective before such terms and conditions can be reopened under the provisions of the contract.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nAgreeing as I do with the Court's construction of 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, I join its opinion on that phase. But I do not think that the Court should now pass upon respondent's alternative defense of breach of contract, which the Court of Appeals did not reach because of its view of the statute. Perhaps that question is not open for judicial consideration. Section 10 (e) of the Act provides that:\n\n\"No objection that has not been urged before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Board has not raised the point here, and it is not clear from the record that respondent urged this objection before the Board. In any event, it is not for this Court in the first instance to construe this particular contract. In remanding the case I would therefore leave it to the Court of Appeals to determine: (1) whether respondent has complied with 10 (e); (2) whether in this contract an agreement not to strike is reasonably to be implied; and (3) whether respondent continued its \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 295]\n\u00a0\n employment relationship with the strikers and should on that account be subject to the consequences of its alleged unfair labor practices even if the strike was in violation of contract. Finally, it is for the Court of Appeals to judge whether the record as a whole supports the Board's findings of unfair labor practices. Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474, 491\n.\n\nThe inherent complications of the problem of statutory construction, as reflected in the conflicting views of the members of the Labor Board, make further discussion desirable, even though this may entail some repetition of what is said in the Court's opinion. Section 8 (d) defines the duty of the employer and the union to bargain collectively. A long proviso in the section treats specifically of this duty where a collective-bargaining agreement is in effect. The proviso must be considered in its entirety:\n\n\"That where there is in effect a collective-bargaining contract covering employees in an industry affecting commerce, the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that no party to such contract shall terminate or modify such contract, unless the party desiring such termination or modification -\n\n\n \"(1) serves a written notice upon the other party to the contract of the proposed termination or modification sixty days prior to the expiration date thereof, or in the event such contract contains no expiration date, sixty days prior to the time it is proposed to make such termination or modification;\n\n\n \"(2) offers to meet and confer with the other party for the purpose of negotiating a new contract or a contract containing the proposed modification;\n\n\n \"(3) notifies the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service within thirty days after such notice of the existence of a dispute, and simultaneously therewith notifies any State or Territorial agency established \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 296]\n\u00a0\n to mediate and conciliate disputes within the State or Territory where the dispute occurred, provided no agreement has been reached by that time; and\n\n\n \"(4) continues in full force and effect, without resorting to strike or lock-out, all the terms and conditions of the existing contract for a period of sixty days after such notice is given or until the expiration date of such contract, whichever occurs later:\n\n\n\"The duties imposed upon employers, employees, and labor organizations by paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) shall become inapplicable upon an intervening certification of the Board, under which the labor organization or individual, which is a party to the contract, has been superseded as or ceased to be the representative of the employees subject to the provisions of section 9 (a), and the duties so imposed shall not be construed as requiring either party to discuss or agree to any modification of the terms and conditions contained in a contract for a fixed period, if such modification is to become effective before such terms and conditions can be reopened under the provisions of the contract. Any employee who engages in a strike within the sixty-day period specified in this subsection shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute, for the purposes of sections 8, 9, and 10 of this Act, as amended, but such loss of status for such employee shall terminate if and when he is reemployed by such employer.\"\n\n\n The reasoned efforts of the five members of the Board and the three Circuit Judges whose task it has been to apply this proviso to the problem before us - where an economic strike occurs prior to the contract's termination but pursuant to its reopening provisions and after sixty \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 297]\n\u00a0\n days' notice - have produced four distinct interpretations of the Act. The Court of Appeals, relying on its previous decision in Wilson & Co. v. Labor Board, 210 F.2d 325, adopted respondent's contention that \"expiration date\" means termination date and that 8 (d) (4) therefore bans all bargaining strikes throughout the life of a collective-bargaining contract. The Board majority held that \"expiration date\" also comprehends \"an agreed date in the course of [the contract's] existence when the parties can effect changes in its provisions . . .\" and that 8 (d) prohibits all strikes during the life of the contract except those in support of bargaining pursuant to a reopening clause. Member Peterson adhered to the Board's former interpretation, see Wilson & Co., 89 N. L. R. B. 310, that so long as the union gives notice of its desire to modify the contract sixty days before striking, 8 (d) does not prohibit a strike at any time during the life of the contract. Finally, Member Murdock argued that 8 (d) \"applies only to the period around the expiration date of a contract,\" which he defined to mean its termination date, and that prior to that period a union may strike without any notice whatsoever.\n\nSuch diverse interpretations, particularly by the authorities charged with the administration of the Act, reflect not only the ambiguity of 8 (d)'s language but also the obscurity of its legislative history. The fact is that the Taft-Hartley Congress did not reveal its \"intention\" regarding our present problem - the legality of economic strikes prior to the contract's ending. It has thus become a judicial responsibility to find that interpretation which can most fairly be said to be embedded in the statute, in the sense of being most harmonious with its scheme and with the general purposes that Congress manifested.\n\nThe construction placed upon the proviso by the Court of Appeals - that it bans strikes throughout the life of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 298]\n\u00a0\n the contract, even at reopening - seems least tenable. Although expiration is a common synonym for termination, 8 (d) does not use the terms interchangeably. It speaks repeatedly of \"termination or modification,\" while \"expiration\" seems to embrace both events. Moreover, this section provides that it\n\n\"shall not be construed as requiring either party to discuss or agree to any modification of the terms and conditions contained in a contract for a fixed period, if such modification is to become effective before such terms and conditions can be reopened under the provisions of the contract.\"\n\n\n This implies an affirmative duty to bargain during reopening. It is not to be assumed that Congress provided such a duty and at the same time foreclosed a potential strike, a conventional factor in the collective-bargaining process.\n\nThe meaning given to \"expiration date\" by the Court of Appeals would make 8 (d) achieve other anomalous results. For example, where there is in effect a two-year contract providing for reopening after one year, the party proposing modification at reopening would not be required by 8 (d) (1) to serve notice upon the other party until ten months after reopening had passed, and 8 (d) (3) would not require notice to mediating agencies until eleven months after reopening. Similarly, the loss-of-status sentence, which applies to employees who strike \"within the sixty-day period specified in this subsection . . .,\" would punish only employees who strike ten months following reopening.\n\nNothing in 8 (d)'s legislative history warrants such a strained construction. To be sure, at one point in the Senate debate Senator Taft did say that \"If such [sixty days'] notice is given, the bill provides for no waiting period except during the life of the contract itself.\" But \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 299]\n\u00a0\n Senator Taft's attention was directed solely to strikes at termination, and this statement was intended merely to emphasize the point made in the following sentence that if notice is given less than sixty days prior to termination the waiting period extends beyond the life of the contract.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nSection 8 (d)'s subsequent legislative history affords persuasive evidence that a reasonable interpretation of what the Taft-Hartley Congress legislated is that it allowed bargaining strikes at reopening if preceded by sixty days' notice. When, in 1948, the ambiguity in the statutory language was called to the attention of Congress, the Joint Committee on Labor-Management Relations, of which Senator Taft was a member, recommended a clarifying amendment in order to avoid the possibility that 8 (d) might be interpreted as either banning strikes at reopening or as permitting strikes prior to reopening. The Committee Report stated:\n\n\"In order that the parties may better know their rights in the matter, the committee recommends the adoption of the amendments which would permit a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 300]\n\u00a0\n strike or a lock-out after a 60-day notice in support of demands they have anticipated in a reopening clause.\" S. Rep. No. 986, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 63 (1948).\n\n\n In 1949, Senator Taft himself proposed such an amendment, S. Rep. No. 99, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 27, 42 (1949), which was passed by the Senate, 95 Cong. Rec. 8717, but never became law.\n\nAt the opposite end of the statutory spectrum is Board Member Murdock's view that 8 (d) only bars strikes at termination, leaving unions free to strike without any notice whatsoever prior to the last sixty days of the contract. Ignoring the introductory paragraph of the proviso, which states: \"Where there is in effect a collective-bargaining contract . . . no party to such contract shall terminate or modify such contract, unless . . .,\" Mr. Murdock urged that the rest of the proviso contemplates the situation \"around\" the contract's \"expiration date,\" which he defined as termination date. From this he inferred that 8 (d) only regulates conduct during this period.\n\nIf Mr. Murdock read \"expiration\" to include reopening, his claim to have resolved 8 (d)'s logical inconsistencies would be more persuasive. The difficulty of his position is made manifest by the last part of the penultimate sentence of 8 (d), which clearly implies that the subsection applies to modifications under a reopening clause. The statement of Senator Ball, a leading proponent of 8 (d), that \"ours is a very mild provision, which merely says to unions. `You must have a 60-day reopening clause in your contract',\" 93 Cong. Rec. 7530, and 8 (d)'s subsequent legislative history, erase any doubt that it was intended to operate at least at reopening as well as at termination.\n\nEven as thus revised the Murdock view is an artifact. It would permit a union, in an effort to force changes in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 301]\n\u00a0\n its contract, to stop work without warning at any time except during the last sixty days of the period fixed by contract and to remain out for the length of the period short of its last sixty days. Yet Mr. Murdock mentioned no factors that would have made Congress so concerned about strikes at expiration as to lay down elaborate procedures applicable thereto and so unconcerned about strikes prior to the expiration period as to ignore them. The legislative history, on the other hand, makes clear that the dominant purpose of Congress in passing 8 (d) was one that is applicable to strikes at both times - to prevent the damaging effects of strikes without warning and to allow a cooling-off period during which differences might be discussed, mediated and resolved. See, e. g., 93 Cong. Rec. 3839, 5005, 5014. If anything, 8 (d)'s application would appear more necessary between expiration periods than during them, since the parties have by their contract warned each other of the possibility of work stoppage at the latter times.\n\nIt is significant also that the 1948 report of the Joint Committee on Labor-Management Relations, S. Rep. No. 986, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 62 (1948), which stated that 8 (d) was subject to three interpretations, did not mention Mr. Murdock's among them. Moreover, since the clarifying amendment proposed by the Committee was designed to preclude the possibility that 8 (d) might be construed to permit strikes at any time prior to reopening upon sixty days' notice, the Committee must have rejected, a fortiori, the possibility that 8 (d) permitted strikes at any time prior to reopening in the absence of such notice. The Murdock view was also rejected by the Board's General Counsel shortly after the Act's passage. He issued a complaint in the Wilson case, supra, even though the strike occurred more than nine months before the contract's reopening date. See 89 N. L. R. B. 310, 317, and S. Rep. No. 986, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 62 (1948). \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 302]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMr. Murdock pointed out that the Senate Report on the Taft-Hartley bill stated, with respect to 301, that a no-strike clause was something to be bargained for, S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 17-18, and he reasoned that it would not have said this \"If it had been intended to remove no-strike provisions from the realm of collective bargaining. . . .\" This argument would have force against an interpretation which actually does remove such provisions from bargaining. Section 8 (d), however, has no effect on whether unions may validly strike over non-bargaining matters. See Mastro Plastics Corp. v. Labor Board, \n350 \nU.S. 270\n. Nor does it render obsolete union pledges not to resort to bargaining strikes at reopening, if the present Board's interpretation is correct, or at any time after sixty days' notice, if the view of the former Board prevails. In any event, this statement from the Committee report on another section of the bill provides a flimsy basis for frustrating the oft-expressed legislative purpose of preventing \"quickie\" strikes.\n\nThe question remains whether the old Board's interpretation is more persuasive than that of the present Board. The statutory language points toward the latter view - that 8 (d) not only proscribes strikes on less than sixty days' notice but also forbids strikes prior to reopening or termination. Section 8 (d) (1) requires the party proposing a change in the contract to give sixty days' notice prior to \"expiration,\" thereby implying that the proposed change will not take place until that time. Only in the event the contract contains no expiration date does this subsection provide for notice \"sixty days prior to the time it is proposed to make such termination or modification; . . . .\" Section 8 (d) (4) explicitly proscribes strikes \"for a period of sixty days after such notice [that provided for in (1)] is given or until the expiration date of such contract, whichever occurs later.\" And the last part of 8 (d)'s penultimate sentence provides further \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 303]\n\u00a0\n evidence that Congress contemplated modification of the contract's terms only at reopening. The loss-of-status clause alone is more favorable to the former Board's view, since it speaks of \"the sixty-day period specified in this subsection,\" and, to be effective under the present Board's construction, this clause has to be understood as reading \"the period specified in paragraph (4).\" Since the problem before us was not anticipated, it is not surprising that 8 (d)'s legislative history offers little direct evidence that Congress did more than require a sixty-day waiting period prior to bargaining strikes. When the Joint Committee did note the problem in 1948, however, it adopted the present Board's view of the statute and not that of the old Board. The light which this subsequent history sheds on the ambiguity reinforces the present Board's construction as the more persuasive interpretation of 8 (d).\n\nAs the Court's opinion holds, since the union struck more than sixty days after giving notice of its desire to amend and in the course of negotiations pursuant to the contract's reopening clause, the Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the Board's order on the ground that the strike violated the waiting requirements of 8 (d).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 10 (f) specifies that this rule shall apply where judicial review of a Board order is obtained by an aggrieved person.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Senator Taft's full statement was:\n\n\"We have provided in the revision of the collective-bargaining procedure, in connection with the mediation process, that before the end of any contract, whether it contains such a provision or not, either party who wishes to open the contract may give 60 days' notice in order to afford time for free collective bargaining, and then for the intervention of the Mediation Service. If such notice is given, the bill provides for no waiting period except during the life of the contract itself. If, however, either party neglects to give such notice and waits, let us say, until 30 days before the end of the contract to give the notice, then there is a waiting period provided during which the strike is an unlawful labor practice for 60 days from that time, or to the end of the contract and 30 days beyond that time. In that case there is a so-called waiting period during which a strike is illegal, but it is only brought about by the failure of the union itself to give the notice which the bill requires shall be given. So it seems to me to be no real limitation of the rights of labor unions.\" 93 Cong. Rec. 3839.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nI join in so much of the Court's opinion as relates to the construction of 8 (d), agreeing with THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S reasoning and MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S further amplification of that problem. But I dissent from that part of the Court's opinion which dismisses respondent's breach of contract defense. That question was never passed on by the Court of Appeals, and I think that our remand should leave it open for the Court of Appeals to decide in the first instance. Further, I find the Court's opinion unclear as to whether the Court of Appeals is likewise \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 304]\n\u00a0\n foreclosed from now dealing with the sufficiency of the evidence as to the unfair labor practice charge against respondent - a question which the Court of Appeals also did not reach because of its views on 8 (d) - and I think that question, too, should be left open for the Court of Appeals on remand.\n\nThis is the fourth time this Term that the Court has passed on questions which the court below never reached. See Mesarosh v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 1\n;\n1\n Thompson v. Coastal Oil Co., \n352 \nU.S. 862\n;\n2\n Gibson v. Phillips Petroleum Co., \n352 \nU.S. 874\n.\n3\n I think this practice is an unfortunate one, depriving this Court, as it does, of the considered views of the lower courts. Its dangers are particularly apparent in the present case. As my brother FRANKFURTER points out, there is at least some question as to whether respondent ever raised its breach of contract defense before the National Labor Relations Board. And on the merits the question is an unusual one because of the atypical nature of this contract, and surely requires \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 305]\n\u00a0\n for its reliable adjudication much sharper consideration than it is possible for this Court to give it here as an original matter. Indeed, the nature of the question is such that the Court of Appeals might well conclude that the issue should be referred to the Board for its expert views in the first instance.\n\nThis kind of original adjudication by this Court is not what litigants have a right to expect. Moreover, to decide questions which, as here, have not been raised in the petition for certiorari offends our own rules.\n4\n There will no doubt be cases where remand is not justified because the questions left open by the lower court are manifestly insubstantial. It seems to me that in such instances this Court should state that it is not remanding for that reason, instead of proceeding as a matter of course to decide the questions itself, either expressly or sub silentio. The latter procedure can only have a tendency to lead this Court, as here, to decide questions which it should not pass upon in the first instance, and in my opinion represents unsound judicial administration.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This Court granted the defendants a new trial on the ground that their conviction was tainted by prosecution evidence suspected to be perjurious. Neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals had passed on this question, and there had been no investigation as to the reliability of the testimony or its precise bearing on the case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Court of Appeals reversed a judgment for the plaintiff in an unseaworthiness case on the ground that plaintiff had signed a valid release. This Court reversed, holding the release invalid, and reinstated the judgment of the District Court. The Court of Appeals therefore never had an opportunity to pass on the other points raised by the defendant on its appeal, mainly the question whether there was sufficient evidence for the finding that the vessel was unseaworthy.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Court of Appeals had held that as a matter of Texas law plaintiff was barred from recovery by his own contributory negligence. This Court reversed and reinstated the judgment of the District Court. Again, the Court of Appeals had no opportunity to pass on alleged errors of the trial court in instructing the jury, that court not having reached those questions on the initial appeal.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Rule 23, 1 (e), Revised Rules. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 282, 306]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLABOR BOARD v. TRUCK DRIVERS UNION(1957)\nNo. 103\nArgued: Decided: April 1, 1957\n\n\n\n\n A group of employers had formed a multi-employer association to bargain jointly with a single union which represented their employees. During contract negotiations between the union and the association, the union struck and picketed the plant of one of the employers belonging to the association. Thereupon the other members of the employers' association, as a defense to the strike against one of their members which imperiled the employers' common interest in bargaining on a group basis, closed their plants and locked out their employees until the strike was terminated. Held: In the circumstances of this case, the National Labor Relations Board properly found that such action by the non-struck members of the employers' association did not constitute an unfair labor practice within the meaning of 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended. Pp. 89-97.\n\n (a) Although there is no express provision of the Act either prohibiting or authorizing a lockout, the Act does not make a lockout unlawful per se; and the legislative history of the Wagner Act indicates that there was no intent to prohibit lockouts as such. P. 92.\n\n\n (b) The unqualified use of the term \"lock-out\" in several sections of the Taft-Hartley Act is a statutory recognition that there are circumstances in which employers may lawfully resort to a lockout as an economic weapon, and this conclusion is supported by the legislative history of the Act. Pp. 92-93.\n\n\n (c) A temporary lockout may lawfully be used as a defense to a union strike tactic which threatens the destruction of the employers' interest in bargaining on a group basis. Pp. 93-96.\n\n\n (d) The history of the Taft-Hartley Act compels the conclusion that Congress intended that the National Labor Relations Board \n\n[353 \nU.S. 87, 88]\n\u00a0\n should continue its established administrative practice of certifying multi-employer groups and intended to leave to the Board's specialized judgment the inevitable questions concerning multi-employer bargaining bound to arise in the future. Pp. 94-96.\n\n\n (e) Although the Act protects the right of the employees to strike in support of their demands, this protection is not so absolute as to deny self-help by employers when legitimate interests of employees and employers collide. P. 96.\n\n\n (f) The function of balancing conflicting legitimate interests so as to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility, which Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review. P. 96.\n\n\n (g) The exercise of discretion by the Board in permitting lockouts is not to be narrowly confined to cases of economic hardship. P. 97.\n\n\n (h) In the circumstances of this case, the Board correctly balanced the conflicting interests in deciding that a temporary lockout to preserve the multi-employer bargaining basis from the disintegration threatened by the union's strike action was lawful.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented by this case is whether the non-struck members of a multi-employer bargaining association committed an unfair labor practice when, during contract negotiations, they temporarily locked out their employees as a defense to a union strike against one of their members which imperiled the employers' common interest in bargaining on a group basis.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board determined that resort to the temporary lockout was not an unfair labor practice in the circumstances.\n1\n The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.\n2\n This Court granted certiorari\n3\n to consider this important question of the construction of the amended National Labor Relations Act,\n4\n and also to consider an alleged conflict with decisions of Courts of Appeals of other circuits.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nEight employers in the linen supply business in and around Buffalo, New York, comprise the membership of the Linen and Credit Exchange. For approximately 13 years, the Exchange and the respondent Union, representing the truck drivers employed by the members, bargained on a multi-employer basis and negotiated successive collective bargaining agreements signed by the Union and by the eight employers. Sixty days before such an agreement was to expire on April 30, 1953, the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 87, 90]\n\u00a0\n Union gave notice of its desire to open negotiations for changes.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Exchange and the Union began negotiations some time before April 30, but the negotiations carried past that date and were continuing on May 26, 1953, when the Union put into effect a \"whipsawing\" plan\n7\n by striking and picketing the plant of one of the Exchange members, Frontier Linen Supply, Inc. The next day, May 27, the remaining seven Exchange members laid off their truck drivers after notifying the Union that the layoff action was taken because of the Frontier strike, advising the Union that the laid-off drivers would be recalled if the Union withdrew its picket line and ended the strike. Negotiations continued without interruption, however, until a week later when agreement was reached upon a new contract which the Exchange members and the Union approved and signed. Thereupon the Frontier strike was ended, the laid-off drivers were recalled, and normal operations were resumed at the plants of all Exchange members.\n\nThe Union filed with the National Labor Relations Board an unfair labor practice charge against the seven employers, alleging that the temporary lockout interfered with its rights guaranteed by 7, thereby violating 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the Act.\n8\n A complaint issued, and, after hearing, a trial examiner found the employers guilty of the unfair labor practice charged. The Board overruled the trial examiner, finding that \"the more \n\n[353 \nU.S. 87, 91]\n\u00a0\n reasonable inference is that, although not specifically announced by the Union, the strike against the one employer necessarily carried with it an implicit threat of future strike action against any or all of the other members of the Association,\" with the \"calculated purpose\" of causing \"successive and individual employer capitulations.\"\n9\n The Board therefore found that \"in the absence of any independent evidence of antiunion motivation, . . . the Respondent's [sic] action in shutting their plants until termination of the strike at Frontier was defensive and privileged in nature, rather than retaliatory and unlawful.\"\n10\n The Board, citing Leonard v. Labor Board, 205 F.2d 355, concluded \"that a strike by employees against one employer-member of a multiemployer bargaining unit constitutes a threat of strike action against the other employers, which threat, per se, constitutes the type of economic or operative problem at the plants of the nonstruck employers which legally justifies their resort to a temporary lockout of employees.\"\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 87, 92]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals agreed \"that the Board reasonably inferred\" a threat of strike action against the seven employers because there were \"no peculiar facts concerning the Union's relations with that single member.\"\n12\n The Court of Appeals thus implicitly found that the only reason for the strike against Frontier was the refusal of the Exchange to meet the Union's demands. But the court held that a temporary lockout of employees on a \"mere threat of, or in anticipation of, a strike\"\n13\n could be justified only if there were unusual economic hardship, and because \"the stipulated facts show no economic justification for the lockout, . . . the lockout of non-striking employees constituted an interference with their statutory right to engage in concerted activity in violation of 8 (a) (1) of the Act, and also constituted discrimination in the hire and tenure of employment of the employees because of the Union's action, thereby discouraging membership in the Union in violation of 8 (a) (3) of the Act.\"\n14\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough, as the Court of Appeals correctly noted, there is no express provision in the law either prohibiting or authorizing the lockout, the Act does not make the lockout unlawful per se. Legislative history of the Wagner Act, 49 Stat. 449, indicates that there was no intent to prohibit strikes or lockouts as such.\n15\n The unqualified use of the term \"lock-out\" in several sections of the Taft-Hartley Act\n16\n is statutory recognition that there are circumstances \n\n[353 \nU.S. 87, 93]\n\u00a0\n in which employers may lawfully resort to the lockout as an economic weapon. This conclusion is supported by the legislative history of the Act.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nWe are not concerned here with the cases in which the lockout has been held unlawful because designed to frustrate organizational efforts, to destroy or undermine bargaining representation, or to evade the duty to bargain.\n18\n Nor are we called upon to define the limits of the legitimate use of the lockout.\n19\n The narrow question to be decided is whether a temporary lockout may lawfully be used as a defense to a union strike tactic which threatens the destruction of the employers' interest in bargaining on a group basis.\n\nThe Court of Appeals rejected the preservation of the integrity of the multi-employer bargaining unit as a justification for an employer lockout.\n20\n The court founded this conclusion upon its interpretation of the Taft-Hartley Act and its legislative history. After stating that \"[m]ulti-employer bargaining has never received the express sanction of Congress,\" the court reasoned that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 87, 94]\n\u00a0\n because at the time of the enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act the Board had never \"gone to the extreme lengths to which it now seeks to go in order to maintain the `stability of the employer unit,'\" Congress cannot be said to have given legislative approval to the present Board action.\n21\n The court concluded that \"Congress must have intended that such a radical innovation be left open for consideration by the joint committee it set up under 402 of the Act to study, among other things, `the methods and procedures for best carrying out the collective-bargaining processes, with special attention to the effects of industry-wide or regional bargaining upon the national economy.'\"\n22\n\u00a0\n\nWe cannot subscribe to this interpretation. Multi-employer bargaining long antedated the Wagner Act, both in industries like the garment industry, characterized by numerous employers of small work forces, and in industries like longshoring and building construction, where workers change employers from day to day or week to week. This basis of bargaining has had its greatest expansion since enactment of the Wagner Act because employers have sought through group bargaining to \n\n[353 \nU.S. 87, 95]\n\u00a0\n match increased union strength.\n23\n Approximately four million employees are now governed by collective bargaining agreements signed by unions with thousands of employer associations.\n24\n At the time of the debates on the Taft-Hartley amendments, proposals were made to limit or outlaw multi-employer bargaining. These proposals failed of enactment. They were met with a storm of protest that their adoption would tend to weaken and not strengthen the process of collective bargaining and would conflict with the national labor policy of promoting industrial peace through effective collective bargaining.\n25\n\u00a0\n\nThe debates over the proposals demonstrate that Congress refused to interfere with such bargaining because there was cogent evidence that in many industries the multi-employer bargaining basis was a vital factor in the effectuation of the national policy of promoting labor peace through strengthened collective bargaining. The inaction of Congress with respect to multi-employer \n\n[353 \nU.S. 87, 96]\n\u00a0\n bargaining cannot be said to indicate an intention to leave the resolution of this problem to future legislation. Rather, the compelling conclusion is that Congress intended \"that the Board should continue its established administrative practice of certifying multi-employer units, and intended to leave to the Board's specialized judgment the inevitable questions concerning multi-employer bargaining bound to arise in the future.\"\n26\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough the Act protects the right of the employees to strike in support of their demands, this protection is not so absolute as to deny self-help by employers when legitimate interests of employees and employers collide.\n27\n Conflict may arise, for example, between the right to strike and the interest of small employers in preserving multi-employer bargaining as a means of bargaining on an equal basis with a large union and avoiding the competitive disadvantages resulting from nonuniform contractual terms. The ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests. The function of striking that balance to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility, which the Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review.\n28\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 87, 97]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals recognized that the National Labor Relations Board has legitimately balanced conflicting interests by permitting lockouts where economic hardship was shown.\n29\n The court erred, however, in too narrowly confining the exercise of Board discretion to the cases of economic hardship. We hold that in the circumstances of this case the Board correctly balanced the conflicting interests in deciding that a temporary lockout to preserve the multi-employer bargaining basis from the disintegration threatened by the Union's strike action was lawful.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 109 N.

But that question is not presented by this case, and we expressly reserve decision until it is properly before us.

Suits previously brought in state courts, by respondent for the death of her husband, and by four other claimants for personal injuries and the loss of the yacht, originally involved claims for damages aggregating more than the value of petitioner's vessels and their pending freight; but the aggregate amount recoverable on such claims was reduced by stipulations and admiralty court orders to an amount less than the value of the vessels and their pending freight. The value of the vessels was undisputed; the claims were fixed; there was no contention that there might be further claims; the fund indubitably was sufficient to pay all claims in full; and the admiralty court had dissolved its injunction against respondent's suit in the state court. Held: In this situation, a concursus beyond that required by the orders heretofore entered in the limitation proceeding is not necessary, and respondent may proceed with her suit in the state court to determine petitioner's obligation to respond in damages for the loss of her husband's life - subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the federal court to protect petitioner's right to limited liability. Pp. 148-154.\n\n (a) Where the fund paid into the proceedings by the offending owner exceeds the claims made against it, there is no necessity for the maintenance of the concourse.

Barton Williams.\n\nFrank C. Mason argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis admiralty limitation proceeding resulted from a maritime disaster in 1954. The aggregate amount of all of the claims filed in the proceeding and for which the petitioner could be held liable if found at fault is less than the value of petitioner's vessels and their pending freight. The question presented is whether the respondent, the principal claimant, may, under these circumstances, proceed with her action in a state court, subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the federal court to protect petitioner's right to limited liability, to determine the obligation of the petitioner to respond in damages for the loss of the life of her husband. We agree with the disposition of the District Court as modified by the Court of Appeals.\n\nRespondent's husband was a passenger on the pleasure yacht, Blackstone, which was involved in a collision on the Hudson River on July 10, 1954, with petitioner's tug, Eastern Cities, push-towing petitioner's barge, L. T. C. No. 38. The Blackstone capsized and respondent's husband was drowned. The other 10 persons on board the yacht were rescued. Respondent, as her husband's administratrix, brought suit against the petitioner in a New York state court claiming $500,000 damages for the loss of her husband's life. She alleged that the loss was caused by Lake Tankers' negligent operation of both its tug and its barge. Actions by four other claimants were also commenced in the New York state courts against the petitioner for damages for personal injuries and for loss of the Blackstone. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 147, 149]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThereafter, Lake Tankers Corporation filed this proceeding in admiralty in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for exoneration from or limitation of liability. As required by the statute authorizing limitation proceedings\n1\n the petitioner filed approved security. While the first bond was only in the amount of $118,542.21, representing the petitioner's interest in its tug alone, thereafter a bond covering the barge in the amount of $165,000 was filed. Appropriate restraining orders were issued enjoining the prosecution or filing of any claims against Lake Tankers except in the limitation proceeding. There is no dispute in regard to the adequacy or correctness of the amount of the two bonds.\n\nAfter petitioner instituted the limitation proceeding the respondent filed a claim for $250,000 in it covering the same loss asserted in her state court case. The 10 survivors, including those who had filed suits in the state court, also filed their claims in the limitation proceeding. These totaled only $9,525. All of the claimants, including respondent, have relinquished all right to any damage in excess of the amounts set forth in their respective claims in the limitation proceeding and expressly limited their recovery to those amounts. The respondent has amended her claim further by allocating $100,000 of her alleged damage to the tug and the remaining $150,000 to the barge. She has also filed stipulations agreeing neither to increase these claims, nor to enter into a judgment in excess of these amounts, and she has waived any claim of res judicata relative to the issue of the petitioner's right to limit liability if that issue should be passed on in the state court proceeding. The District Court on application then vacated the restraining order since the total fund exceeded the amount of the claims. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 147, 150]\n\u00a0\n 137 F. Supp. 311. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, entering an order, to which respondent has also agreed, with respect to the state court suit, as follows:\n\n\"`If claimant obtains a judgment in her state court suit for an amount in excess of $100,000, an injunction will issue permanently enjoining her from collecting such excess unless the judgment rests on a special verdict allocating the amount as between the libelant as owner of the tug and as owner of the barge respectively. Thus if the judgment exceeds $100,000 and the jury finds libelant liable solely as owner of the tug, she will be enjoined from collecting any excess. If the jury finds that the libelant is liable solely as owner of the barge, she will be enjoined from collecting any amount in excess of $150,000.'\" 232 F.2d 573, 577.\n\n\n On rehearing the Second Circuit, sitting en banc, reaffirmed its decision. 235 F.2d 783. We granted certiorari to pass upon the important jurisdictional question presented. \n352 \nU.S. 914\n.\n\nThis Court has recently considered the cases which discuss the historical background of the Limited Liability Act, R. S. 4281-4289, as amended, 46 U.S.C. 181-196, in British Transport Commission v. United States, ante, p. 129. It was there pointed out that the Act was adopted primarily to encourage the development of American merchant shipping. The first section of the Act here involved contains its fundamental provision which declares that the liability for any damage arising from a disaster at sea which is occasioned without the privity or knowledge of the shipowner shall in no case exceed the value of the vessel at fault together with her pending freight, 46 U.S.C. 183. As Mr. Justice Van Devanter stated for a unanimous Court in White v. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 147, 151]\n\u00a0\n Island Transportation Co., \n233 \nU.S. 346, 351\n (1914), \"The succeeding sections are in the nature of an appendix and relate to the proceedings by which the first is to be made effective. Therefore, they should be so construed as to bring them into correspondence with it.\" Among these sections dealing with the mechanics of effecting such limitation of liability is 184 covering those incidents where \"the whole value of the vessel, and her freight for the voyage, is not sufficient to make compensation to each of [the claimants].\" In that event, the section continues, \"they shall receive compensation from the owner of the vessel in proportion to their respective losses; and for that purpose\" the owners \"may take the appropriate proceedings in any court . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) The succeeding section provides that in such an event the owner \"may petition a district court of the United States . . . for limitation of liability within the provisions of this chapter . . . .\" It further declares that upon compliance with its requirements \"all claims and proceedings against the owner with respect to the matter in question shall cease.\" This provision is implemented by Rule 51 of our Admiralty Rules which spells out in more detail the manner in which the owner of any vessel who \"shall desire to claim the benefit of limitation of liability . . .\" shall proceed. It is, therefore, crystal clear that the operation of the Act is directed at misfortunes at sea where the losses incurred exceed the value of the vessel and the pending freight. And, as is pointed out in British Transport Commission, supra, where the fund created pursuant to the Act is inadequate to cover all damages and the owner has sought the protection of the Act the issues arising from the disaster could be litigated within the limitation proceeding. Otherwise the purpose of the Act, i. e., limitation of the owner's liability, might be frustrated. Only in this manner may there be a marshalling of all of the statutory assets remaining after the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 147, 152]\n\u00a0\n disaster and a concourse of claimants. In such a situation it matters not to the owner what the \"take\" of the individual claimant may be from the proceeding for under the Act his payment is limited to the value of the vessel and the pending freight. He can suffer no more in any event.\n\nOn the other hand, where the value of the vessel and the pending freight, the fund paid into the proceeding by the offending owner, exceeds the claims made against it, there is no necessity for the maintenance of the concourse. This is not to say that concursus is not available where a vessel owner in good faith believes the fund inadequate, but here there is no contention that there might be further claims; the value of the vessels is undisputed and the claims are fixed; it follows indubitably that the fund is sufficient to pay all claims in full. While it is true that the claims as initially filed in the state court exceeded the fund created in the limitation proceeding, still when the admiralty court dissolved the injunction against the state suit these claims, as filed in and limited by stipulation and order of the admiralty court in the limitation proceeding, aggregated less than the fund. On appeal the Court of Appeals placed even more severe restrictions on the state court prosecution, thus insuring beyond doubt that petitioner's right of limitation under the Act was fully protected.\n\nFor us to expand the jurisdictional provisions of the Act to prevent respondent from now proceeding in her state case would transform the Act from a protective instrument to an offensive weapon by which the shipowner could deprive suitors of their common-law rights, even where the limitation fund is known to be more than adequate to satisfy all demands upon it. The shipowner's right to limit liability is not so boundless. The Act is not one of immunity from liability but of limitation of it and we read no other privilege for the shipowner into its language over and above that granting him limited \n\n[354 \nU.S. 147, 153]\n\u00a0\n liability. In fact, the Congress not only created the limitation procedure for the primary purpose of apportioning the limitation fund among the claimants where that fund was inadequate to pay the claims in full, but it reserved to such suitors their common-law remedies. 63 Stat. 101, 28 U.S.C. 1333.\n2\n In view of this explicit mandate from the Congress the respondent must not be thwarted in her attempt to employ her common-law remedy in the state court where she may obtain trial by jury.\n\nThe state proceeding could have no possible effect on the petitioner's claim for limited liability in the admiralty court and the provisions of the Act, therefore, do not control. Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 539\n-540 (1931). It follows that there can be no reason why a shipowner, under such conditions, should be treated any more favorably than an airline, bus, or railroad company. None of them can force a damage claimant to trial without a jury. They, too, must suffer a multiplicity of suits. Likewise, the shipowner, so long as his claim of limited liability is not jeopardized, is subject to all common-law remedies available against other parties in damage actions. The Act, as we have said, was not adopted to insulate shipowners from liability but merely to limit it to the value of the vessel and the pending freight. It is contended that Maryland Casualty Co. v. Cushing, \n347 \nU.S. 409\n (1954), is to the contrary. While there was no opinion \n\n[354 \nU.S. 147, 154]\n\u00a0\n of the Court in that case, it involved an alleged clash between Louisiana's direct action statute and the Act. The majority concluded there was no clash. The amount of the claims there far exceeded the value, if any, of the vessel and the pending freight. The language in one opinion to the effect that concursus is \"the heart\" of the limitation system therefore refers to those cases where the claims exceed the value of the vessel and the pending freight. In that event, as we have pointed out, the concursus is vital to the protection of the offending owner's statutory right of limitation. But this is not to say that where concursus is not necessary to the protection of this statutory right it is nonetheless required.\n\nWe conclude that in the situation here a concursus beyond that required by the orders heretofore entered in this case is not necessary and respondent may therefore proceed with her state court suit.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] R. S. 4285, as amended, 46 U.S.C. 185.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The forerunner of the current section gave the District Courts jurisdiction \"Of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it . . . .\" 42 Stat. 634, 28 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 41 (3). As re-enacted it reads, in pertinent part, that the District Courts have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts in the States in \"Any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.\" 63 Stat. 101, 28 U.S.C. 1333.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.\n\nI agree with the result reached by Judge Hincks in his dissenting opinion below, 232 F.2d 573, 579, and think that this judgment should be reversed. Since federal limitation jurisdiction was properly invoked, we should not permit it to be aborted by subsequent actions by the claimants with a view to obtaining transfer of the trial of their claims to the state courts. At the time the limitation proceeding was commenced the total claims which had been asserted in the several state court actions far exceeded the value of both the vessels owned by the petitioner, and limitation proceedings were required. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 147, 155]\n\u00a0\n The steps subsequently taken by the claimants to limit their maximum recovery against the petitioner should no more be allowed to defeat or impair the full effectiveness of the limitation proceeding than would a subsequent reduction in the amount involved be permitted to defeat a diversity jurisdiction which had initially been properly invoked.

Brown, Attorney General. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 225, 226]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSection 52.38 (a) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code defines \"convicted person\" as follows:\n\n \"Any person who, subsequent to January 1, 1921, has  been or hereafter is convicted of an offense punishable  as a felony in the State of California, or who has  been or who is hereafter convicted of any offense in  any place other than the State of California, which  offense, if committed in the State of California,  would have been punishable as a felony.\"\n\n\n Section 52.39 provides that it shall be unlawful for \"any convicted person\" to be or remain in Los Angeles for a period of more than five days without registering; it requires any person having a place of abode outside the city to register if he comes into the city on five occasions or more during a 30-day period; and it prescribes the information to be furnished the Chief of Police on registering.\n\nSection 52.43 (b) makes the failure to register a continuing offense, each day's failure constituting a separate offense.\n\nAppellant, arrested on suspicion of another offense, was charged with a violation of this registration law.\n*\n The evidence showed that she had been at the time of her arrest a resident of Los Angeles for over seven years. Within that period she had been convicted in Los Angeles of the crime of forgery, an offense which California punishes as a felony. Though convicted of a crime punishable as a felony, she had not at the time of her arrest registered under the Municipal Code. At the trial, appellant \n\n[355 \nU.S. 225, 227]\n\u00a0\n asserted that 52.39 of the Code denies her due process of law and other rights under the Federal Constitution, unnecessary to enumerate. The trial court denied this objection. The case was tried to a jury which found appellant guilty. The court fined her $250 and placed her on probation for three years. Appellant, renewing her constitutional objection, moved for arrest of judgment and a new trial. This motion was denied. On appeal the constitutionality of the Code was again challenged. The Appellate Department of the Superior Court affirmed the judgment, holding there was no merit to the claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The case is here on appeal. 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2). We noted probable jurisdiction, \n352 \nU.S. 914\n, and designated amicus curiae to appear in support of appellant. The case having been argued and reargued, we now hold that the registration provisions of the Code as sought to be applied here violate the Due Process requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe registration provision, carrying criminal penalties, applies if a person has been convicted \"of an offense punishable as a felony in the State of California\" or, in case he has been convicted in another State, if the offense \"would have been punishable as a felony\" had it been committed in California. No element of willfulness is by terms included in the ordinance nor read into it by the California court as a condition necessary for a conviction.\n\nWe must assume that appellant had no actual knowledge of the requirement that she register under this ordinance, as she offered proof of this defense which was refused. The question is whether a registration act of this character violates due process where it is applied to a person who has no actual knowledge of his duty to register, and where no showing is made of the probability of such knowledge. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 225, 228]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not go with Blackstone in saying that \"a vicious will\" is necessary to constitute a crime, 4 Bl. Comm. *21, for conduct alone without regard to the intent of the doer is often sufficient. There is wide latitude in the lawmakers to declare an offense and to exclude elements of knowledge and diligence from its definition. See Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 559, 578\n. But we deal here with conduct that is wholly passive - mere failure to register. It is unlike the commission of acts, or the failure to act under circumstances that should alert the doer to the consequences of his deed. Cf. Shevlin-Carpenter Co. v. Minnesota, \n218 \nU.S. 57\n; United States v. Balint, \n258 \nU.S. 250\n; United States v. Dotterweich, \n320 \nU.S. 277, 284\n. The rule that \"ignorance of the law will not excuse\" (Shevlin-Carpenter Co. v. Minnesota, supra, p. 68) is deep in our law, as is the principle that of all the powers of local government, the police power is \"one of the least limitable.\" District of Columbia v. Brooke, \n214 \nU.S. 138, 149\n. On the other hand, due process places some limits on its exercise. Engrained in our concept of due process is the requirement of notice. Notice is sometimes essential so that the citizen has the chance to defend charges. Notice is required before property interests are disturbed, before assessments are made, before penalties are assessed. Notice is required in a myriad of situations where a penalty or forfeiture might be suffered for mere failure to act. Recent cases illustrating the point are Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co., \n339 \nU.S. 306\n; Covey v. Town of Somers, \n351 \nU.S. 141\n; Walker v. Hutchinson City, \n352 \nU.S. 112\n. These cases involved only property interests in civil litigation. But the principle is equally appropriate where a person, wholly passive and unaware of any wrongdoing, is brought to the bar of justice for condemnation in a criminal case. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 225, 229]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegistration laws are common and their range is wide. Cf. Bryant v. Zimmerman, \n278 \nU.S. 63\n; United States v. Harriss, \n347 \nU.S. 612\n; United States v. Kahriger, \n345 \nU.S. 22\n. Many such laws are akin to licensing statutes in that they pertain to the regulation of business activities. But the present ordinance is entirely different. Violation of its provisions is unaccompanied by any activity whatever, mere presence in the city being the test. Moreover, circumstances which might move one to inquire as to the necessity of registration are completely lacking. At most the ordinance is but a law enforcement technique designed for the convenience of law enforcement agencies through which a list of the names and addresses of felons then residing in a given community is compiled. The disclosure is merely a compilation of former convictions already publicly recorded in the jurisdiction where obtained. Nevertheless, this appellant on first becoming aware of her duty to register was given no opportunity to comply with the law and avoid its penalty, even though her default was entirely innocent. She could but suffer the consequences of the ordinance, namely, conviction with the imposition of heavy criminal penalties thereunder. We believe that actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand. As Holmes wrote in The Common Law, \"A law which punished conduct which would not be blameworthy in the average member of the community would be too severe for that community to bear.\" Id., at 50. Its severity lies in the absence of an opportunity either to avoid the consequences of the law or to defend any prosecution brought under it. Where a person did not know of the duty to register and where there was no proof of the probability of such knowledge, he may not be convicted consistently \n\n[355 \nU.S. 225, 230]\n\u00a0\n with due process. Were it otherwise, the evil would be as great as it is when the law is written in print too fine to read or in a language foreign to the community.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON dissents because he believes that, as applied to this appellant, the ordinance does not violate her constitutional rights.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For a recent comprehensive review of these registration laws see Note, 103 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 60 (1954).\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nThe present laws of the United States and of the forty-eight States are thick with provisions that command that some things not be done and others be done, although persons convicted under such provisions may have had no awareness of what the law required or that what they did was wrongdoing. The body of decisions sustaining such legislation, including innumerable registration laws, is almost as voluminous as the legislation itself. The matter is summarized in United States v. Balint, \n258 \nU.S. 250, 252\n: \"Many instances of this are to be found in regulatory measures in the exercise of what is called the police power where the emphasis of the statute is evidently upon achievement of some social betterment rather than the punishment of the crimes as in cases of mala in se.\"\n\nSurely there can hardly be a difference as a matter of fairness, of hardship, or of justice, if one may invoke it, between the case of a person wholly innocent of wrongdoing, in the sense that he was not remotely conscious of violating any law, who is imprisoned for five years for conduct relating to narcotics, and the case of another person who is placed on probation for three years on condition that she pay $250, for failure, as a local resident, convicted under local law of a felony, to register under \n\n[355 \nU.S. 225, 231]\n\u00a0\n a law passed as an exercise of the State's \"police power.\"\n*\n Considerations of hardship often lead courts, naturally enough, to attribute to a statute the requirement of a certain mental element - some consciousness of wrongdoing and knowledge of the law's command - as a matter of statutory construction. Then, too, a cruelly disproportionate relation between what the law requires and the sanction for its disobedience may constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment as a cruel and unusual punishment, and, in respect to the States, even offend the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nBut what the Court here does is to draw a constitutional line between a State's requirement of doing and not doing. What is this but a return to Year Book distinctions between feasance and nonfeasance - a distinction that may have significance in the evolution of common-law notions of liability, but is inadmissible as a line between constitutionality and unconstitutionality. One can be confident that Mr. Justice Holmes would have been the last to draw such a line. What he wrote about \"blameworthiness\" is worth quoting in its context:\n\n \"It is not intended to deny that criminal liability, as well as civil, is founded on blameworthiness. Such a denial would shock the moral sense of any civilized community; or, to put it another way, a law which punished conduct which would not be blameworthy in the average member of the community would be too severe for that community to bear.\" (This passage \n\n[355 \nU.S. 225, 232]\n\u00a0\n must be read in the setting of the broader discussion of which it is an essential part. Holmes, The Common Law, at 49-50.)\n\n\n If the generalization that underlies, and alone can justify, this decision were to be given its relevant scope, a whole volume of the United States Reports would be required to document in detail the legislation in this country that would fall or be impaired. I abstain from entering upon a consideration of such legislation, and adjudications upon it, because I feel confident that the present decision will turn out to be an isolated deviation from the strong current of precedents - a derelict on the waters of the law. Accordingly, I content myself with dissenting.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] This case does not involve a person who, convicted of a crime in another jurisdiction, must decide whether he has been convicted of a crime that \"would have been punishable as a felony\" had it been committed in California. Appellant committed forgery in California, and was convicted under California law. Furthermore, she was convicted in Los Angeles itself, and there she resided for over seven years before the arrest leading to the present proceedings. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 225, 233]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAWLOR v. NATIONAL SCREEN SERVICE CORP.(1957)\nNo. 632\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1957\n\n\n  Mr. Francis T. Anderson, for petitioners.\n  Mr. Louis Nizer, for respondent.\n\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n  We agree with the Court of Appeals that the motion for summary judgment should have been denied. However, in our view, this disposition of the case made it unnecessary for the Court of Appeals to pass on any other issue than that of the per se invalidity of exclusive contracts under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note. In order that the District Court not be bound by the consideration the Court of Appeals gave to the remaining issues, and without reaching any of the same, we grant the petition for writ of certiorari, vacate the judgments, and remand the cause to the District Court for trial.\n\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, whom Mr. Justice BURTON and Mr. Justice HARLAN join, dissenting.\n  The District Court granted the motion of plaintiffs, the petitioners here, for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals, having found that summary judgment was not warranted, remanded the case for '(t)rial of the disputed factual issues.' 238 F.2d 59, 68. This Court also holds that the motion for summary judgment should have been denied by the District Court: it grants certiorari and vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals, but directs the District Court to do precisely what the Court of Appeals directed that court to do. This is the legal situation unless I wholly misconceive the matter.\n  Since the Court's disposition of the petition for certiorari affects the proper administration of its own busi- \n\n[352 \nU.S. 992\n, 993]\n\u00a0\n ness as well as the relation between this Court and Courts of Appeals, the matter deserves exposition.\n  The Court of Appeals thus stated what it called the critical issue before it: 'Was there, in the cases involved in these appeals (there were other cases affecting other parties), a genuine issue as to a material fact which, under well-settled principles, precluded the entry of summary judgments adjudicating the defendant-appellant, National Screen Service Corporation ('National') to be an unlawful monopoly?' 238 F.2d at pages 60- 61. Having found that there were triable issues of fact, it concluded that summary judgment should not have been entered and sent the case back for trial. This Court now echoes these conclusions: the motion for summary judgment should have been denied and the plaintiffs must establish their claim at trial.\n  The explanation of the puzzle must lie in the statement that this Court is doing what it is doing '(i)n order that the District Court not be bound by the consideration the Court of Appeals gave to the remaining issues. ...' This is an oblique concern about the so-called 'law of the case.' The only 'law of the case' decided by the Court of Appeals is the legal issue on which this Court agrees with the Court of Appeals. Nowhere is there a suggestion in the petition for certiorari that when the case goes back to the District Court, the trial will be restricted in determining the facts relevant to a claim under the antitrust laws. ( Indeed, petitioners' only suggestion that the new trial directed by the Court of Appeals will not leave all relevant issues open for trial is that the Court of Appeals indicated that some issues 'require determination by the trier of facts,' while the petitioners suggest that these are issues to be determined by the trial court as a matter of law.) \n\n[352 \nU.S. 992\n, 994]\n\u00a0\n  One cannot read the thirteen pages of argument in support of the petition here and not be left with the conviction that the adjudication before the Court of Appeals was exclusively of the issue as the Court of Appeals stated it. That is 'the law of the case,' so far as that phrase has meaning, and nothing else. In the federal courts 'the law of the case' is not a legal principle. It is a bogey that has been exposed, a ghost that has been laid, since Mr. Justice Holmes' opinion for the Court in Messinger v. Anderson, \n225 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 740. The misuse of the rule of practice embodied in the conception of 'law of the case,' we had occasion to reject in United States v. United States Smelting, Refining & Mining Co., \n339 \nU.S. 186, 198\n, 544: 'It is not applicable here because when the case was first remanded, nothing was finally decided. The whole proceeding thereafter was in fieri.' Here the only thing that was decided was, as this Court holds, rightly decided-namely, that on the facts summary judgment is precluded and the case must go to trial.\n  In granting the writ of certiorari, the Court sets aside all consideration by the Court of Appeals of issues other than 'that of the per se invalidity of exclusive contracts under the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C.A .  1-7, 15 note).' It is a customary practice for a Court of Appeals, in sending a case back to a District Court for trial, to give guidance on issues that may arise in the course of the trial in order to avoid needless appeals and retrials. No doubt a District Court must follow the adjudication of a Court of Appeals on reversal and remand of a case. But here the only adjudication was that the case be triea on all the relevant issues. We review judgments not talk. The basis of the reversal was a consideration by the Court of Appeals of opinions of this Court, and more particularly of our recent decisions in Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594\n, and United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n351 \nU.S. 377\n. What this Court has decided in those and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 992\n, 995]\n\u00a0\n other antitrust cases, and not any passing observations by a Court of Appeals, are the controlling directions for the District Court.\n  If the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case disregarded controlling rulings of this Court, the District Court is of course not bound to disregard such decisions of this Court. A District Court can hardly fail in its duty to its Court of Appeals in obeying what decisions of this Court command. On the other hand, if the Court of Appeals has expressed views that do not run counter to what this Court has decided, this Court should not direct the District Court to disregard them. Surely, this Court should not go out of its way to purport to pass on these questions at this stage of the proceedings, especially when the questions are abstract, and more particularly in such summary fashion. If we begin to grant petitions for certiorari although we agree with the judgment of a Court of Appeals because, perchance, in the opinion some dubious remarks may have been made that cannot as a matter of law control the trial of the cause (I am not implying that such is the case here), a new fecund source of business will still further swell the docket of this Court. Of course, if ever the contingency arises when a Court of Appeals challengingly or ignorantly disregards the controlling law as set forth by this Court, the means for correction here are ample and sure.\n  I would deny the petition. \n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEE KUM HOY v.

In 1945, he was granted a conditional pardon by the Governor of Ohio for the second conviction. After enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, he was ordered deported thereunder on two grounds: (1) as an alien who, at the time of entry, was excludable by the then existing law, and (2) as an alien who had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude, for neither of which had he been granted \"a full and unconditional pardon.\" In a habeas corpus proceeding, he challenged the validity of his deportation.

Lavine and Jack Wasserman.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nRespondent, a native and citizen of Italy, entered the United States in 1919 as a stowaway. No action was taken to deport him \"within five years after entry\" as then limited by 19 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 889.\n\nOn January 15, 1936, respondent was convicted in Ohio of the crime of blackmail, and he was sentenced to imprisonment. On April 25, 1936, he was again convicted in Ohio of another crime of blackmail and sentenced to imprisonment. The second sentence was to begin at the expiration of the first. He was released from prison on February 1, 1941. A proceeding to deport him, under the provisions of 19 of the Act of February 5, 1917, based upon his convictions of these two independent crimes, was commenced, but before final determination of that proceeding, the Governor of Ohio, on July 30, 1945, granted petitioner a conditional pardon\n1\n for the second conviction. Because of that conditional pardon and of the provision in 19 of the 1917 Act that \"the deportation of aliens convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude \n\n[353 \nU.S. 685, 687]\n\u00a0\n shall not apply to one who has been pardoned,\" that deportation proceeding was withdrawn on October 9, 1945.\n\nIn 1952 Congress enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., by which it repealed\n2\n the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, and, in many respects, substantially changed the law. The present proceeding was brought under the 1952 Act to deport respondent upon two grounds: first, under 241 (a) (1), as an alien who, at the time of entry, was excludable by the law existing at the time of entry (i. e., a stowaway under 3 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 875), and, second, under 241 (a) (4), as an alien who had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude for neither of which had he been granted \"a full and unconditional pardon.\" After a hearing, respondent was ordered deported by a special inquiry officer. That order was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n\nRespondent then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, contending that, because of the five-year limitation contained in the former Act ( 19 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917), he could not lawfully be deported as a stowaway after the lapse of five years from the date he entered this country, and that he could not lawfully be deported for having been convicted of the two crimes of blackmail, because he had been conditionally pardoned for one of them. The District Court denied the petition. The Court of Appeals reversed, 228 F.2d 142 holding that respondent had acquired a \"status of nondeportability,\" under the prior law, which was protected to him by the savings clause in 405 (a) of the 1952 Act, 66 Stat. 280, 8 U.S.C. 1101. Note, \"unless otherwise \n\n[353 \nU.S. 685, 688]\n\u00a0\n specifically provided\" in that Act, which it held had not been done. We granted certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 915\n.\n\nSection 405 (a) of the 1952 Act, upon which the Court of Appeals relied, provides in pertinent part as follows:\n\n \"(a) Nothing contained in this Act, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, shall be construed . . . to affect any prosecution, suit, action, or proceedings, civil or criminal, brought, or any status, condition, right in process of acquisition, act, thing, liability, obligation, or matter, civil or criminal, done or existing, at the time this Act shall take effect; but as to all such prosecutions, suits, actions, proceedings, statutes,\n3\n conditions, rights, acts, things, liabilities, obligations, or matters the statutes or parts of statutes repealed by this Act are, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, hereby continued in force and effect. . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n By its express terms, 405 (a) does not apply if it is \"otherwise specifically provided\" in the Act. As respects the grounds of deportation involved here, we think the Act does otherwise specifically provide in 241, 66 Stat. 204, 8 U.S.C. 1251. That section, so far as here pertinent, provides:\n\n \"(a) Any alien in the United States (including an alien crewman) shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be deported who -\n\n\n \"(1) at the time of entry was within one or more of the classes of aliens excludable by the law existing at the time of such entry;\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(4) . . . at any time after entry is convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out \n\n[353 \nU.S. 685, 689]\n\u00a0\n of a single scheme of criminal misconduct, regardless of whether confined therefor and regardless of whether the convictions were in a single trial;\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(b) The provisions of subsection (a) (4) respecting the deportation of an alien convicted of a crime or crimes shall not apply (1) in the case of any alien who has subsequent to such conviction been granted a full and unconditional pardon by the President of the United States or by the Governor of any of the several states . . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, the provisions of this section shall be applicable to all aliens belonging to any of the classes enumerated in subsection (a), notwithstanding (1) that any such alien entered the United States prior to the date of enactment of this Act, or (2) that the facts, by reason of which any such alien belongs to any of the classes enumerated in subsection (a), occurred prior to the date of enactment of this Act.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n Thus, even if we assume that respondent has a \"status\" within the meaning of 405 (a), that section by its own terms does not apply to situations \"otherwise specifically provided\" for in the Act. Section 241 (a) (1) specifically provides for the deportation of an alien who \"at the time of entry was . . . excludable by the law existing at [that] time,\" and 241 (a) (4) specifically provides for the deportation of an alien who \"at any time after entry\" has been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude. And 241 (d) makes 241 (a) (1) and 241 (a) (4) applicable to all aliens covered thereby, \"notwithstanding (1) that any such alien entered the United States prior to the date of enactment of this Act, or (2) that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 685, 690]\n\u00a0\n the facts, by reason of which any such alien belongs to any of the classes enumerated in subsection (a), occurred prior to the date of enactment of this Act.\" It seems to us indisputable, therefore, that Congress was legislating retrospectively, as it may do,\n4\n to cover offenses of the kind here involved. This case is, therefore, \"otherwise specifically provided\" for within the meaning of 405 (a). The Court of Appeals was in error in holding to the contrary, and its judgment is\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The pardon was \"conditioned upon good behavior and conduct and provided that he demeans himself as a law abiding person and is not convicted of any other crime, otherwise this Pardon to become null and void.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 403 (a) (13), 66 Stat. 279.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] It appears to be obvious that this was a typographical error and that the word should be read as \"statuses.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Bugajewitz v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS concurs.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nI agree with the Court that 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. 1251, makes aliens deportable for past offenses which when committed were not grounds for deportation. The Court goes on to hold, however, that such retrospective legislation is a valid exercise of congressional power, despite Art. I, 9, of the Constitution providing that \"No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\" Past decisions cited by the Court support this holding on the premise that the ex post facto clause only forbids \"penal legislation which imposes or increases criminal punishment for conduct lawful previous to its enactment.\" Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, \n342 \nU.S. 580, 594\n. I think this definition confines the clause too narrowly. As MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS pointed out in his dissenting opinion in Marcello v. Bonds, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 685, 691]\n\u00a0\n \n349 \nU.S. 302, 319\n, another line of decisions by this Court has refused to limit the protections of the clause to criminal cases and criminal punishments as those terms were defined in earlier times. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138, 139; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277; Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333. And see United States v. Lovett, \n328 \nU.S. 303, 315\n, 316.\n\nWhat is being done to these respondents seems to me to be the precise evil the ex post facto clause was designed to prevent. Both respondents are ordered deported for offenses they committed long ago - one in 1925 and the other in 1936. Long before the 1952 Act reached back to add deportation as one of the legal consequences of their offenses both paid the price society then exacted for their misconduct. They have lived in the United States for almost 40 years. To banish them from home, family, and adopted country is punishment of the most drastic kind whether done at the time when they were convicted or later. I think that this Court should reconsider the application of the ex post facto clause with a view to applying it in a way that more effectively protects individuals from new or additional burdens, penalties, or punishments retrospectively imposed by Congress.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [NOTE: This opinion applies also to No. 435, Mulcahey, District Director, Immigration and Naturalization Service, v.

Marshall argued the cause for the California Company et al., respondents. With him on the brief was Eugene D. Saunders.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents for decision important questions regarding the applicability to the United States of the restrictions against stay of state court proceedings contained in 28 U.S.C. 2283 and the propriety of the injunction decreed by the District Court and sustained by the Court of Appeals. Petitioner in 1953 had filed a petitory action in a Louisiana state court against respondent-mineral-lessees of the United States. In that action, a suit by one out of possession claiming title to, and possession of, immovables, petitioner sought to have itself declared owner of the mineral rights under land owned by the United States, and it also sought an accounting for oil and other minerals removed by respondent-lessees under their lease from the United States. Petitioner founded its claim on Louisiana Act No. 315 of 1940, La. Rev. Stat., 1950, 9:5806, which, it alleged, made \"imprescriptible\" a reservation of mineral rights in a deed of December 21, 1938, to the United States by its predecessor in title.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRespondent-lessees filed exceptions in the state court proceedings, urging that under Louisiana law the lessor should be made a party and the lessees discharged from the suit, that this was essentially a suit against the United States, which had not consented to be sued, that the United States was an indispensable party, and that no cause of action had been stated. The state trial court found that a cause of action had been stated, and it overruled the exceptions.\n\nAt this point the United States, joining petitioner and other interested parties as defendants, brought the present \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n suit in the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana to quiet title to the mineral rights; it also sought a preliminary injunction to restrain petitioner from prosecuting its action in the state court. The United States based its claim of ownership on the provision in the 1938 deed from petitioner's predecessor in title that the reservation of mineral rights would expire on April 1, 1945, subject to certain conditions not material to this case. The United States claimed that irreparable injury in the form of loss of royalties would result from any temporary, wrongful dispossession of its lessees by the state court proceedings. Affidavits were also submitted in support of the claim that permanent loss of wells currently producing oil would probably result from any temporary cessation of production. The petitioner moved to dismiss the United States' complaint on the ground that the state court had already assumed jurisdiction over the property in question; in the alternative, petitioner moved to stay the federal proceedings pending determination of the state court action because questions of state law were involved.\n\nThe District Court held that, since the United States was not a party to the state court suit, the title of the United States could be tried only in the federal court action and that an injunction against prosecution of the state proceedings should issue to protect its jurisdiction pending determination of the ownership of the property. 127 F. Supp. 439. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the preliminary injunction was proper because \"the district court under the clear provisions of the statute. 28 U.S.C. 1345, became vested with exclusive jurisdiction to determine the title of the United States to the mineral rights claimed by appellant.\" 224 F.2d 381, 383-384. Because of the presence of important and difficult questions of federal-state relations, questions \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 224]\n\u00a0\n more difficult than the Government appears to have found them, we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 964\n.\n\n28 U.S.C. 2283 provides:\n\n \"A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\"\n\n\n It must first be decided whether this section applies to stays sought by the United States because different answers to this question will put different aspects on other issues in the case. An analogous problem was presented in United States v. United Mine Workers, \n330 \nU.S. 258\n, where the Court held that the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C. 101, that no federal court had jurisdiction, subject to qualifications, to issue an injunction in labor disputes to prohibit certain acts, did not apply to the United States. The Norris-LaGuardia Act, like 28 U.S.C. 2283, effected, in general language, a limitation on the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Furthermore, since it was largely the diversity jurisdiction which spawned the substantive problems that the Norris-LaGuardia Act removed from the federal courts, the limitations on the federal courts imposed by the Norris-LaGuardia Act, like those of 28 U.S.C. 2283, were in an area of federal-state relations calling for particular circumspection in adjudication.\n\nIn interpreting the general language of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the Court relied heavily on \"an old and well-known rule,\" albeit a rule of construction, \"that statutes which in general terms divest pre-existing rights or privileges will not be applied to the sovereign without express words to that effect.\" \n330 \nU.S., at 272\n. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 225]\n\u00a0\n While, strictly speaking, any \"pre-existing\" rights would have to be found in the 1789-1793 pre-statute period,\n2\n the rationale of the rule requires not that the rights be \"pre-existing\" but rather that they would exist apart from the statute. There can be no doubt, apart from the restrictions of 28 U.S.C. 2283, of the right of the United States to enjoin state court proceedings whenever the prerequisites for relief by way of injunction be present. Treating the rule invoked in the United Mine Workers case merely as an aid to construction, it would by itself lead us to hold that the general language of 28 U.S.C. 2283 did not apply to the United States in the absence of countervailing considerations, such as significant legislative history pointing toward its inclusion or inferences clearly to be drawn from relevant presuppositions for so including it.\n\nIn United Mine Workers, the Court did not rely entirely on the rule of construction because its reading of the Act as a whole and the legislative history supported the conclusion that the United States was not to be included. In this case, there is no legislative material to support or to gainsay the applicability of the rule of construction. There is, however, a persuasive reason why the federal court's power to stay state court proceedings might have been restricted when a private party was seeking the stay but not when the United States was seeking similar relief. The statute is designed to prevent conflict between federal and state courts. This policy is much more compelling when it is the litigation of private parties which threatens to draw the two judicial systems into conflict than when it is the United States which seeks a stay to prevent threatened irreparable injury to a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 226]\n\u00a0\n national interest. The frustration of superior federal interests that would ensue from precluding the Federal Government from obtaining a stay of state court proceedings except under the severe restrictions of 28 U.S.C. 2283 would be so great that we cannot reasonably impute such a purpose to Congress from the general language of 28 U.S.C. 2283 alone. It is always difficult to feel confident about construing an ambiguous statute when the aids to construction are so meager, but the interpretation excluding the United States from the coverage of the statute seems to us preferable in the context of healthy federal-state relations.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe question still remains whether the granting of an injunction was proper in the circumstances of this case. We start with one certainty. The suit in the federal court was the only one that could finally determine the basic issue in the litigation - whether the title of the United States to the mineral rights was affected by Louisiana Act No. 315 of 1940. The United States was not a party to the state suit and, under settled principles, title to land in possession of the United States under a claim of interest cannot be tried as against the United States by a suit against persons holding under the authority of the United States. See United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196\n. Although the state court might mould petitioner's \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 227]\n\u00a0\n suit to try title into a suit for possession or might merely order respondent-lessees to account for minerals removed, nevertheless such proceedings could not settle the basic issue in the litigation and might well cause confusion if they resulted in a judgment inconsistent with that subsequently rendered by the federal court.\n\nPetitioner relies heavily on United States v. Bank of New York & Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 463\n. There, in a federal district court proceeding, the United States was claiming by assignment certain funds of three Russian insurance companies that were being held in the custody of a state court, in connection with the liquidation of the companies, subject to court orders concerning distribution to claimants under the state insurance laws. On the basis of this claim, the United States sought to enjoin distribution of the funds and to require payment of them to it. This Court, affirming dismissal of the complaints and denial of the injunction, held that the state court had obtained jurisdiction over the funds first and that the litigation should be resolved in that court. The Court also noted that there were numerous other claimants, indispensable parties, who had not been made parties to the federal court suit. In remitting the United States to the state court, the Court saw no \"impairment of any rights\" of the United States or \"any sacrifice of its proper dignity as a sovereign.\" Id., at 480-481.\n\nThe situation in the present case is different. All the parties in the state court proceeding have been joined in the federal proceeding. Moreover, the Bank of New York case presented the more unusual situation where the United States, like any private claimant, made a claim against funds that it never possessed and that were in the hands of depositaries appointed by the state court. In this case, a private party is seeking by a state proceeding to obtain property currently in the hands of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 228]\n\u00a0\n persons holding under the United States; the United States is seeking to protect that possession and quiet title by a federal court proceeding. Therefore, since the position of the United States is essentially a defensive one, we think that it should be permitted to choose the forum in this case, even though the state litigation has the elements of an action characterized as quasi in rem. We therefore hold that the District Court properly exercised its jurisdiction to entertain the suit in the federal court and to prevent the effectuation of state court proceedings that might conflict with the ultimate federal court judgment.\n\nOne further aspect of the case remains to be considered. The District Court advanced this additional ground for its decision:\n\n \"Moreover, if the state court suit is allowed to proceed to final judgment, the rights of the United States to the property in question will actually be determined `behind its back' . . . for the reason that, since ownership of these mineral rights will turn on an interpretation of a state statute . . . this court and the appellate federal courts may be required, under Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins . . . to follow that judgment in spite of the fact that the United States is not a party to those proceedings. . . .\" 127 F. Supp., at 444.\n\n\n But the fact that the United States is not a party to the state court litigation does not mean that the federal court should initiate interpretation of a state statute. In fact, where questions of constitutionality are involved - and the Government contends that an application of the state statute adverse to its interests would be unconstitutional - our rule has been precisely the opposite: \"as questions of federal constitutional power have become more \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 229]\n\u00a0\n and more intertwined with preliminary doubts about local law, we have insisted that federal courts do not decide questions of constitutionality on the basis of preliminary guesses regarding local law.\" Spector Motor Co. v. McLaughlin, \n323 \nU.S. 101, 105\n; see Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lok Po, \n336 \nU.S. 368, 383\n; Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496, 498\n-502.\n\nThe Government contends that Act No. 315 of 1940 does not apply when the parties themselves have contracted for a reservation of specific duration and that if the statute is construed to apply to this situation, it would impair the obligation of the Government's contract. Petitioner disagrees. The Supreme Court of Louisiana has never considered the specific issue or even discussed generally the rationale of the statute, especially with reference to problems of constitutionality. The District Court recognized the importance of the statute in deciding this case; it also recognized that a problem of interpretation was involved, that the statute cannot be read by him who runs. What are the situations to which the statute is applicable? Is the statute merely declaratory of prior Louisiana law? What are the problems that it was designed to meet? The answers to these questions are, or may be, relevant. Before attempting to answer them and to decide their relation to the issues in the case, we think it advisable to have an interpretation, if possible, of the state statute by the only court that can interpret the statute with finality, the Louisiana Supreme Court. The Louisiana declaratory judgment procedure appears available to secure such an interpretation, La. Rev. Stat., 1950, 13:4231 et seq., and the United States of course may appear to urge its interpretation of the statute. See Stanley v. Schwalby, \n147 \nU.S. 508, 512\n-513. It need hardly be added that the state courts in such a proceeding can decide definitively only \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 230]\n\u00a0\n questions of state law that are not subject to overriding federal law.\n\nWe therefore modify the judgment of the Court of Appeals to permit an interpretation of the state statute to be sought with every expedition in the state court in conformity with this opinion.\n\n    Modified and affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The reservation, in its pertinent portion, provided: \"The Vendor reserves from this sale the right to mine and remove, or to grant to others the right to mine and remove, all oil, gas and other valuable minerals which may be deposited in or under said lands, and to remove any oil, gas or other valuable minerals from the premises; the right to enter upon said lands at any time for the purpose of mining and removing said oil, gas and minerals, said right, subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, to expire April 1, 1945, it being understood, however, that the vendors will pay to the United States of America, 5% of the gross proceeds received by them as royalties or otherwise from all oil or minerals so removed from in or under the aforedescribed lands, until such time as the vendors \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n shall have paid to the United States of America, the sum of $25,000, being the purchase price paid by said United States of America for the aforedescribed properties.\n\n .  .   .  .  .\n\n\n\"Provided that at the termination of the ten (10) year period of reservation, if not extended, or at the termination of any extended period in case the operation has not been carried on for the number of days stated, the right to mine shall terminate, and complete fee in the land become vested in the United States.\n\n\n\"The reservation of the oil and mineral rights herein made for the original period of ten (10) years and for any extended period or periods in accordance with the above provisions shall not be affected by any subsequent conveyance of all or any of the aforementioned properties by the United States of America, but said mineral rights shall, subject to the conditions above . . . set forth, remain vested in the vendors.\"\n\n\n Act No. 315 provides:\". . . when land is acquired by conventional deed or contract, condemnation or expropriation proceedings by the United States of America, or any of its subdivisions or agencies, from any person, firm or corporation, and by the act of acquisition, verdict or judgment, oil, gas, and\/or other minerals or royalties are reserved, or the land so acquired is by the act of acquisition conveyed subject to a prior sale or reservation of oil, gas and\/or other minerals or royalties, still in force and effect, said rights so reserved or previously sold shall be imprescriptible.\" See also the prior Act No. 151 of 1938 providing that prescription should not run against a reservation of mineral rights in real estate acquired by the United States or the State of Louisiana.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The basic provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2283 go back to 1793, 1 Stat. 335.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Most of the lower federal courts that have considered this problem have, without much discussion, reached the same result. E. g., United States v. Taylor's Oak Ridge Corp., 89 F. Supp. 28; United States v. Cain, 72 F. Supp. 897; United States v. Phillips, 33 F. Supp. 261, reversed on other grounds, \n312 \nU.S. 246\n; United States v. McIntosh, 57 F.2d 573; United States v. Babcock, 6 F.2d 160, reversed for modification, 9 F.2d 905; United States v. Inaba, 291 F. 416. But see United States v. Land Title Bank & Trust Co., 90 F.2d 970; United States v. Certain Parcels of Land, 62 F. Supp. 1017, appeal dismissed by stipulation, 151 F.2d 1022.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting in part.\n\nI agree that the state action was properly enjoined; and so I concur in the opinion of the Court to that extent. But I dissent from the direction to the District Court to hold the case while the parties repair to the state court to get an interpretation of the Louisiana statute around which this litigation turns.\n\nThat procedure is an advisable one where private parties question the constitutionality of a state statute. An authoritative construction of the state law may avoid the constitutional issue or put it in new perspective. See Spector Motor Co. v. McLaughlin, \n323 \nU.S. 101, 104\n-105. In the Spector case, the plaintiff's claim was within the jurisdiction of the federal court solely because of the attack on the constitutionality of a state statute. Under 28 U.S.C. 1331, the federal district court has jurisdiction where the matter in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional amount \"and arises under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.\" In litigation in the federal courts under that statute, the necessity of construing state law arises because of the federal court's duty to avoid if possible a federal constitutional question. Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175\n. In the Spector case, then, matters of state law were only ancillary to the primary responsibility of the federal court to resolve the constitutional issues. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 231]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBut here, although potential constitutional questions may lurk in the background, this litigation primarily concerns not federal questions but title to land claimed by the United States. It is litigation which Congress by 28 U.S.C. 1345, 1346, has entrusted to the federal district court. Those sections allow civil litigation of the United States - whether it involves federal or state law questions - to be conducted in the federal courts. In that situation it is the duty of the federal court to decide all issues in the case - those turning on state law as well as those turning on federal law. In Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228\n, a case in the federal courts by reason of diversity of citizenship, we refused to remit the parties to the state court for decision of difficult state law questions. We held that it was the duty of the federal court to decide all issues in the case - state or federal, difficult or easy. And see Propper v. Clark, \n337 \nU.S. 472\n. There have been exceptions to this policy, notably in bankruptcy proceedings where trustees are sometimes sent into state courts to obtain adjudications on local law questions pertinent to the administration of the bankrupt's estate. See Thompson v. Magnolia Co., \n309 \nU.S. 478\n. It is peculiarly inappropriate to follow that course here. Congress has decided that the United States should have the benefit of the protection of its own courts in this type of litigation. We properly hold that the District Court, not the state court, has jurisdiction of the controversy. But we beat the devil around the bush when, having taken the litigation out of the state court, we send the parties back to the state court for its construction of Louisiana law which is the most significant issue in the case. The problem is not only to construe the state statute but to construe it constitutionally. The federal court can make that construction as readily as the state court. That is the congressional scheme and we should not change it by judicial fiat. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 220, 232]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLIBSON SHOPS, INC. v. KOEHLER(1957)\nNo. 64\nArgued: January 15, 1957Decided: May 27, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Under 23 (s) and 122 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, a corporation resulting from a merger of 17 separately incorporated businesses which had filed separate income tax returns may not carry over and deduct the pre-merger net operating losses of three of its constituent corporations from the post-merger income attributable to the other businesses. Pp. 382-390.\n\n 229 F.2d 220, affirmed.\n\nHenry C. Lowenhaupt and Owen T. Armstrong argued the cause for petitioner. With them on the brief was Abraham Lowenhaupt.\n\nJohn N. Stull argued the cause for respondent. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice, Harry Baum and Grant W. Wiprud.\n\nLouis Eisenstein filed a brief for the Newmarket Manufacturing Co., as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe issue before us is whether, under 23 (s) and 122 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, a corporation resulting from a merger of 17 separate incorporated businesses, which had filed separate income tax returns, may carry over and deduct the pre-merger net operating losses of three of its constituent corporations from the post-merger income attributable to the other businesses. We hold that such a carry-over and deduction is not permissible.\n\nPetitioner, Libson Shops, Inc., was incorporated on January 2, 1946, under the laws of Missouri, as Libson Shops Management Corporation, to provide management \n\n[353 \nU.S. 382, 383]\n\u00a0\n services for corporations selling women's apparel at retail. Its articles of incorporation also permitted it to sell apparel. At about the same time, the same interests incorporated 16 separate corporations to sell women's apparel at retail at separate locations. Twelve were incorporated and went into business in Missouri; four in Illinois. Each of these 16 sales corporations was operated separately and filed separate income tax returns. Petitioner's sole activity was to provide management services for them. The outstanding stock of all 17 corporations was owned, directly or indirectly, by the same individuals in the same proportions.\n\nOn August 1, 1949, the 16 sales corporations were merged into petitioner under the laws of Missouri and Illinois. New shares of petitioner's stock were issued, pro rate, in exchange for the stock of the sales corporations. By virtue of the merger agreement, petitioner's name was changed, the amount and par value of its stock revised, and its corporate purposes expanded. Following the merger, petitioner conducted the entire business as a single enterprise. Thus, the effect of the merger was to convert 16 retail businesses and one managing agency, reporting their incomes separately, into a single enterprise filing one income tax return.\n\nPrior to the merger, three of the sales corporations showed net operating losses. These were as follows:\n\n Corporation  Taxable Period Amount\n\n\n Evanston Libson Shops, Inc.. Calendar year 1948 ...... $8,115.11     Fiscal period begun Jan. 1,    1949, and ended July 31,    1949 ................... 6,422.28 Lawrence Libson Shops, Inc.. Fiscal period ended July    31, 1948 ................ 245.03     Fiscal year ended July 31,    1949 ................... 2,770.42 Hampton Libson Shops, Inc.. Fiscal year ended July 31,    1949 ................... 4,879.92        ___________\n\nTotal .............................................. $22,432.76 \n\n[353 \nU.S. 382, 384]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In the year following the merger, each of the retail units formerly operated by these three corporations continued to sustain a net operating loss.\n\nIn its income tax return for the first year after the merger, petitioner claimed a deduction of the above $22,432.76 as a carry-over of its pre-merger losses. Petitioner sought this deduction under 23 (s) and 122 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed it and petitioner paid the resulting tax deficiency. In due course petitioner brought this suit for a refund in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. That court dismissed petitioner's complaint and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 229 F.2d 220. We granted certiorari to decide the questions of tax law involved. \n351 \nU.S. 961\n.\n\nSection 23 (s) authorizes a \"net operating loss deduction computed under section 122.\"\n1\n Section 122 prescribes three basic rules for this calculation. Its pertinent parts provide generally (1) that a \"net operating loss\" is the excess of the taxpayer's deductions over its gross income ( 122 (a)); (2) that, if the taxpayer has a net operating loss, the loss may be used as a \"net operating loss carry-back\" to the two prior years ( 122 (b) (1) (A)) and, if not exhausted by that carry-back, the remainder may be used as a \"net operating loss carry-over\" to the three succeeding years ( 122 (b) (2) (C)); and (3) that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 382, 385]\n\u00a0\n the aggregate of the net operating loss carry-backs and carry-overs applicable to a given taxable year is the \"net operating loss deduction\" for the purposes of 23 (s) ( 122 (c)).\n\nWe are concerned here with a claim to carry over an operating loss to the immediately succeeding taxable year. The particular provision on which petitioner's case rests is as follows:\n\n \"If for any taxable year beginning after December  31, 1947, and before January 1, 1950, the taxpayer  has a net operating loss, such net operating loss shall  be a net operating loss carry-over for each of the  three succeeding taxable years . . . .\" (Emphasis  supplied.) 122 (b) (2) (C), 64 Stat. 937, 938, 65  Stat. 505, 26 U.S.C. 122 (b) (2) (C).\n\n\n The controversy centers on the meaning of \"the taxpayer.\"\n2\n The contentions of the parties require us to decide whether it can be said that petitioner, a combination of 16 sales businesses, is \"the taxpayer\" having the pre-merger losses of three of those businesses.\n\nIn support of its denial of the carry-over, the Government argues that this statutory privilege is not available unless the corporation claiming it is the same taxable entity as that which sustained the loss. In reliance on New Colonial Co. v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 435\n, and cases following it,\n3\n the Government argues that separately \n\n[353 \nU.S. 382, 386]\n\u00a0\n chartered corporations are not the same taxable entity. Petitioner, on the other hand, relying on Helvering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., \n306 \nU.S. 522\n, and cases following it,\n4\n argues that a corporation resulting from a statutory merger is treated as the same taxable entity as its constituents to whose legal attributes it has succeeded by operation of state law. However, we find it unnecessary to discuss this issue since an alternative argument made by the Government is dispositive of this case. The Government contends that the carry-over privilege is not available unless there is a continuity of business enterprise. It argues that the prior year's loss can be offset against the current year's income only to the extent that this income is derived from the operation of substantially the same business which produced the loss. Only to that extent is the same \"taxpayer\" involved.\n\nThe requirement of a continuity of business enterprise as applied to this case is in accord with the legislative history of the carry-over and carry-back provisions. Those provisions were enacted to ameliorate the unduly drastic consequences of taxing income strictly on an annual basis. They were designed to permit a taxpayer to set off its lean years against its lush years, and to strike something like an average taxable income computed over a period longer than one year.\n5\n There is, however, no indication in their legislative history that these provisions \n\n[353 \nU.S. 382, 387]\n\u00a0\n were designed to permit the averaging of the premerger losses of one business with the post-merger income of some other business which had been operated and taxed separately before the merger. What history there is suggests that Congress primarily was concerned with the fluctuating income of a single business.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThis distinction is recognized by the very cases on which petitioner relies. In Stanton Brewery, Inc. v. Commissioner, 176 F.2d 573, 577, the Court of Appeals stressed the fact that the merging corporations there involved carried on \"essentially a continuing enterprise, entitled to all . . . benefits [of the carry-over provisions] in ameliorating otherwise harsh tax consequences of fluctuating profits or expanding business.\" (Emphasis supplied.) And in Newmarket Manufacturing Co. v. United States, 233 F.2d 493, 497, the court expressly distinguished the case before it from the instant case on the ground that there \"one single business\" was involved \n\n[353 \nU.S. 382, 388]\n\u00a0\n in the merger, while in this case there were \"several businesses.\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThis difference is not merely a matter of form. In the Newmarket case, supra, a corporation desiring to change the state of its domicile caused the organization of a new corporation and merged into it. The new corporation sought to carry back its post-merger losses to the premerger income of the old corporation. But for the merger, the old corporation itself would have been entitled to a carry-back. In the present case, the 16 sales corporations, prior to the merger, chose to file separate income tax returns rather than to pool their income and losses by filing a consolidated return. Petitioner is attempting to carry over the pre-merger losses of three business units which continued to have losses after the merger. Had there been no merger, these businesses would have had no opportunity to carry over their losses. If petitioner is permitted to take a carry-over, the 16 sales businesses have acquired by merger an opportunity that they elected to forego when they chose not to file a consolidated return.\n\nWe do not imply that a question of tax evasion or avoidance is involved. Section 129 (a) of the 1939 Code, as amended, does contain provisions which may vitiate \n\n[353 \nU.S. 382, 389]\n\u00a0\n a tax deduction that was made possible by the acquisition of corporate property for the \"principal purpose\" of tax evasion or avoidance.\n8\n And that section is inapplicable here since there was no finding that tax evasion or avoidance was the \"principal purpose\" of the merger. The fact that 129 (a) is inapplicable does not mean that petitioner is automatically entitled to a carry-over. The availability of this privilege depends on the proper interpretation to be given to the carry-over provisions. We find nothing in those provisions which suggests that they should be construed to give a \"windfall\" to a taxpayer who happens to have merged with other corporations. The purpose of these provisions is not to give a merged \n\n[353 \nU.S. 382, 390]\n\u00a0\n taxpayer a tax advantage over others who have not merged. We conclude that petitioner is not entitled to a carry-over since the income against which the offset is claimed was not produced by substantially the same businesses which incurred the losses.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents.\n\nMR.

Section 153 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1942, c. 619, 56 Stat. 798, 847-848, amended 122 (b) not only to allow carry-backs for the first time, but also to provide, as to both carry-backs and carry-overs, that it was only the net operating losses of \"the taxpayer\" which could be so utilized.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] These words have been omitted from the new provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 relating to carry-backs and carry-overs after corporate acquisitions of assets of another corporation.

Prior to the Revenue Act of 1932, such 2-year carry-over was allowed. No net loss has ever been allowed for a greater period than 2 years. In the Revenue Act of 1932, the 2-year net loss carry-over was reduced to 1 year and in the National Industrial Recovery Act the net loss carry-over was entirely eliminated. As a result of the elimination of this carry-over, a business with alternating profit and loss is required to pay higher taxes over a period of years than a business with stable profits, although the average income of the two firms is equal. New enterprises and the capital-goods industries are especially subject to wide fluctuations in earnings. It is, therefore, believed that the allowance of a net operating business loss carry-over will greatly aid business and stimulate new enterprises.\" (Emphasis supplied.) H. R. Rep.

Supp. 290, also involves a situation in which the corporation resulting from the merger carried on essentially the same taxable enterprise as before, since the merged corporation had been filing consolidated tax returns. E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Commissioner, 227 F.2d 699, is inconclusive on this point since the opinion does not disclose whether or not a continuing enterprise was involved. Cf. 382 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 relating to the purchase of a corporation and change in its trade or business. Under circumstances there defined, that section precludes a carry-over by the same corporation, unless it continues to engage in \"substantially the same\" trade or business as before the change in ownership. 382 (a) (1) (C).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Revenue Act of 1943, c. 63, 58 Stat. 21, 47, by 128, added to the 1939 Code the following section:\n\n\"SEC. 129.

For the purposes of clauses (1) and (2), control means the ownership of stock possessing at least 50 per centum of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 per centum of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of the corporation.\"\n\n\n See H.

The Court of Appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting. 98 U.S. App. D.C. 406, 236 F.2d 701. Since an important question involving the interpretation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was involved in this capital case, we granted the petition for certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 877\n.\n\nThe rape occurred at six p. m. on April 7, 1954, in the basement of the apartment house inhabited by the victim. She had descended to the basement a few minutes previous to wash some laundry. Experiencing some difficulty in detaching a hose in the sink, she sought help from the janitor, who lived in a basement apartment with his wife, two grown sons, a younger son and the petitioner, his nineteen-year-old half-brother. Petitioner was alone in the apartment at the time. He detached the hose and returned to his quarters. Very shortly thereafter, a masked man, whose general features were identified to resemble those of petitioner and his two grown nephews, attacked the woman. She had heard no one descend the wooden steps that furnished the only means of entering the basement from above.\n\nPetitioner and one of his grown nephews disappeared from the apartment house shortly after the crime was committed. The former was apprehended the following afternoon between two and two-thirty p. m. and was taken, along with his older nephews, also suspects, to police headquarters. At least four officers questioned him there in the presence of other officers for thirty to forty-five minutes, beginning the examination by telling him, according to his testimony, that his brother had said that he was the assailant. Petitioner strenuously denied his guilt. He spent the rest of the afternoon at headquarters, in the company of the other two suspects and his brother a good part of the time. About four p. m. the three suspects were asked to submit to \"lie detector\" tests, and they agreed. The officer in charge of the polygraph \n\n[354 \nU.S. 449, 451]\n\u00a0\n machine was not located for almost two hours, during which time the suspects received food and drink. The nephews were then examined first. Questioning of petitioner began just after eight p. m. Only he and the polygraph operator were present in a small room, the door to which was closed.\n\nFollowing almost an hour and one-half of steady interrogation, he \"first stated that he could have done this crime, or that he might have done it. He finally stated that he was responsible . . . .\" (Testimony of polygraph operator, R. 70.) Not until ten p. m., after petitioner had repeated his confession to other officers, did the police attempt to reach a United States Commissioner for the purpose of arraignment. Failing in this, they obtained petitioner's consent to examination by the deputy coroner, who noted no indicia of physical or psychological coercion. Petitioner was then confronted by the complaining witness and \"[p]ractically every man in the Sex Squad,\" and in response to questioning by three officers, he repeated the confession. Between eleven-thirty p. m. and twelve-thirty a. m. he dictated the confession to a typist. The next morning he was brought before a Commissioner. At the trial, which was delayed for a year because of doubt about petitioner's capacity to understand the proceedings against him, the signed confession was introduced in evidence.\n\nThe case calls for the proper application of Rule 5 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, promulgated in 1946, \n327 \nU.S. 821\n. That Rule provides:\n\n \"(a) APPEARANCE BEFORE THE COMMISSIONER. An officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available commissioner or before any other nearby officer \n\n[354 \nU.S. 449, 452]\n\u00a0\n empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States. When a person arrested without a warrant is brought before a commissioner or other officer, a complaint shall be filed forthwith.\"\n\n\n This provision has both statutory and judicial antecedents for guidance in applying it. The requirement that arraignment be \"without unnecessary delay\" is a compendious restatement, without substantive change, of several prior specific federal statutory provisions. (E. g., 20 Stat. 327, 341; 48 Stat. 1008; also 28 Stat. 416.) See Dession, The New Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure: I, 55 Yale L. J. 694, 707. Nearly all the States have similar enactments.\n\nIn McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332, 343\n-344, we spelled out the important reasons of policy behind this body of legislation:\n\n \"The purpose of this impressively pervasive requirement of criminal procedure is plain. . . . The awful instruments of the criminal law cannot be entrusted to a single functionary. The complicated process of criminal justice is therefore divided into different parts, responsibility for which is separately vested in the various participants upon whom the criminal law relies for its vindication. Legislation such as this, requiring that the police must with reasonable promptness show legal cause for detaining arrested persons, constitutes an important safeguard - not only in assuring protection for the innocent but also in securing conviction of the guilty by methods that commend themselves to a progressive and self-confident society. For this procedural requirement checks resort to those reprehensible practices known as the `third degree' which, though universally rejected as indefensible, still find their \n\n[354 \nU.S. 449, 453]\n\u00a0\n way into use. It aims to avoid all the evil implications of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime.\"\n\n\n Since such unwarranted detention led to tempting utilization of intensive interrogation, easily gliding into the evils of \"the third degree,\" the Court held that police detention of defendants beyond the time when a committing magistrate was readily accessible constituted \"willful disobedience of law.\" In order adequately to enforce the congressional requirement of prompt arraignment, it was deemed necessary to render inadmissible incriminating statements elicited from defendants during a period of unlawful detention.\n\nIn Upshaw v. United States, \n335 \nU.S. 410\n, which came here after the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure had been in operation, the Court made it clear that Rule 5 (a)'s standard of \"without unnecessary delay\" implied no relaxation of the McNabb doctrine.\n\nThe requirement of Rule 5 (a) is part of the procedure devised by Congress for safeguarding individual rights without hampering effective and intelligent law enforcement. Provisions related to Rule 5 (a) contemplate a procedure that allows arresting officers little more leeway than the interval between arrest and the ordinary administrative steps required to bring a suspect before the nearest available magistrate. Rule 4 (a) provides: \"If it appears from the complaint that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, a warrant for the arrest of the defendant shall issue . . . .\" Rule 4 (b) requires that the warrant \"shall command that the defendant be arrested and brought before the nearest available commissioner.\" And Rules 5 (b) and (c) reveal the function of the requirement of prompt arraignment:\n\n \"(b) STATEMENT BY THE COMMISSIONER. The commissioner shall inform the defendant of the complaint \n\n[354 \nU.S. 449, 454]\n\u00a0\n against him, of his right to retain counsel and of his right to have a preliminary examination. He shall also inform the defendant that he is not required to make a statement and that any statement made by him may be used against him. The commissioner shall allow the defendant reasonable time and opportunity to consult counsel and shall admit the defendant to bail as provided in these rules.\n\n\n \"(c) PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION. The defendant shall not be called upon to plead. If the defendant waives preliminary examination, the commissioner shall forthwith hold him to answer in the district court. If the defendant does not waive examination, the commissioner shall hear the evidence within a reasonable time. The defendant may cross-examine witnesses against him and may introduce evidence in his own behalf. If from the evidence it appears to the commissioner that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, the commissioner shall forthwith hold him to answer in the district court; otherwise the commissioner shall discharge him. The commissioner shall admit the defendant to bail as provided in these rules.\"\n\n\n The scheme for initiating a federal prosecution is plainly defined. The police may not arrest upon mere suspicion but only on \"probable cause.\" The next step in the proceeding is to arraign the arrested person before a judicial officer as quickly as possible so that he may be advised of his rights and so that the issue of probable cause may, be promptly determined. The arrested person may, of course, be \"booked\" by the police. But he is not to be taken to police headquarters in order to carry out a process of inquiry that lends itself, even if not so designed, to eliciting damaging statements to support the arrest and ultimately his guilt. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 449, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe duty enjoined upon arresting officers to arraign \"without unnecessary delay\" indicates that the command does not call for mechanical or automatic obedience. Circumstances may justify a brief delay between arrest and arraignment, as for instance, where the story volunteered by the accused is susceptible of quick verification through third parties. But the delay must not be of a nature to give opportunity for the extraction of a confession.\n\nThe circumstances of this case preclude a holding that arraignment was \"without unnecessary delay.\" Petitioner was arrested in the early afternoon and was detained at headquarters within the vicinity of numerous committing magistrates. Even though the police had ample evidence from other sources than the petitioner for regarding the petitioner as the chief suspect, they first questioned him for approximately a half hour. When this inquiry of a nineteen-year-old lad of limited intelligence produced no confession, the police asked him to submit to a \"lie-detector\" test. He was not told of his rights to counsel or to a preliminary examination before a magistrate, nor was he warned that he might keep silent and \"that any statement made by him may be used against him.\" After four hours of further detention at headquarters, during which arraignment could easily have been made in the same building in which the police headquarters were housed, petitioner was examined by the lie-detector operator for another hour and a half before his story began to waver. Not until he had confessed, when any judicial caution had lost its purpose, did the police arraign him.\n\nWe cannot sanction this extended delay, resulting in confession, without subordinating the general rule of prompt arraignment to the discretion of arresting officers in finding exceptional circumstances for its disregard. In every case where the police resort to interrogation of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 449, 456]\n\u00a0\n an arrested person and secure a confession, they may well claim, and quite sincerely, that they were merely trying to check on the information given by him. Against such a claim and the evil potentialities of the practice for which it is urged stands Rule 5 (a) as a barrier. Nor is there an escape from the constraint laid upon the police by that Rule in that two other suspects were involved for the same crime. Presumably, whomever the police arrest they must arrest on \"probable cause.\" It is not the function of the police to arrest, as it were, at large and to use an interrogating process at police headquarters in order to determine whom they should charge before a committing magistrate on \"probable cause.\"\n\n   Reversed and remanded. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 449, 457]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMANION v.

Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500, 524\n, I gave my reasons for deeming it an abuse of the Court's discretionary certiorari jurisdiction to make cases arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act a class exception \n\n[354 \nU.S. 517, 518]\n\u00a0\n to the Court's principle against granting certiorari when all that is involved is the evaluation of evidence. The circumstances of the present case vividly emphasize the objections to such an exception.\n\nAll that is to be determined in this case is whether there were sufficient facts to warrant a jury in finding that the lighting in the situation in which petitioner worked, assumed to be inadequate, caused in whole or in part the injury to petitioner. The trial judge in the Court of Common Pleas thought not. On review, the Court of Appeals of Lucas County reversed: two judges thought there were enough facts to justify a jury's finding of causation while the dissenting judge agreed with the trial court. On review of this reversal, the Supreme Court of Ohio, with one of its seven judges not sitting, unanimously reversed the Court of Appeals and restored the judgment of the trial court. 166 Ohio St. 129, 140 N. E. 2d 319. Thus, this issue of the sufficiency of evidence for a jury's finding of relevant causation was passed on by the three courts in the hierarchy of Ohio's judiciary. Of the ten judges, eight found the evidence insufficient for a jury to guess at and two thought they should be allowed to guess - for determination of causation is inescapably guessing, informed guessing if you will, but guessing.\n\nCongress saw fit to give the state courts jurisdiction of the rights it created by the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Presumably, it had confidence in the state courts for enforcement of these rights. It emphasized this confidence by a special Act, passed more than forty years ago, which withdrew from this Court what theretofore had been appealability as of right of judgments of state courts in Federal Employers' Liability Act cases. It left adjudications brought in the state courts with the state courts, except in instances applicable generally to the jurisdiction on writ of certiorari, to be exercised, that \n\n[354 \nU.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n is, \"only where there are special and important reasons therefor.\" Rule 19 of the Revised Rules of this Court.\n\nIt cannot be too often repeated. This Court has said again and again that a difference of opinion in weighing evidence is not included among \"special and important reasons\" for granting certiorari. One would suppose that an examination of the evidence by three courts and ten judges of Ohio would be proof that the facts in the case have been conscientiously canvassed. A different case would be presented were this Court to find that the Ohio Supreme Court applied wrong legal standards to the particular facts before it or evinced hostility to the federal statute. Either one of these grounds would present a fair basis on which to seek review here of the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court. But that is not the basis on which review was sought and on which it is granted. In agreeing to take the case, the Court merely accedes to the natural desire of an unsuccessful plaintiff to have one more court guess whether there were enough facts on which the jury should be allowed to do its guessing. And so the nine members of the highest tribunal in the land, preoccupied with more than enough cases involving the gravest issues of national importance, are asked to take on the task of making an independent study of the record below, (for I must assume that those who review the merits have examined the 294 pages of the record), the four opinions below, and the briefs of parties, after three courts and ten judges of Ohio have conscientiously dealt with questions that are not specialized questions of federal law and indeed constitute probably the most recurring staple business of the courts throughout the country.\n\nI must respectfully decline to assume this task. This Court from time to time is compelled to hold that a federal court has abused some discretionary judicial power. Abuse of judicial discretion is a technical phrase to express a misconception of the judicial function as exercised in a \n\n[354 \nU.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n particular situation. There is no appeal from such abuse of judicial discretion by this Court. When there is such a misuse of power, as I deem it to be in making an exception, in effect if not formally, of cases under the Federal Employers' Liability Act that turn merely on evaluation of evidence, only the individual conscience remains. Since this case underscores the reasons for declining to associate myself in what I regard as a misuse of the power properly vested in a minority of this Court in granting certiorari, I have no choice but to conclude that the writ of certiorari in this case has been improvidently granted and, having been granted, should be dismissed.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, dissenting.\n\nFor the reasons stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio, 166 Ohio St. 129, 140 N.

Later, respondent, a Texas corporation, agreed to assume the insurance obligations of the Arizona corporation and mailed a reinsurance certificate to petitioner's son in California, offering to insure him in accordance with his policy. He accepted this offer and paid premiums by mail from his California home to respondent's office in Texas. Neither corporation has ever had any office or agent in California or done any other business in that State. Petitioner sent proofs of her son's death to respondent, but it refused to pay the claim. Under a California statute subjecting foreign corporations to suit in California on insurance contracts with residents of California, even though such corporations cannot be served with process within the State, petitioner sued respondent and obtained judgment in a California court, process being served only by registered mail to respondent's principal place of business in Texas.

JUSTICE BLACK, announced by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n\nPetitioner, Lulu B. McGee, recovered a judgment in a California state court against respondent, International Life Insurance Company, on a contract of insurance. Respondent was not served with process in California but by registered mail at its principal place of business in Texas. The California court based its jurisdiction on a state statute which subjects foreign corporations to suit in California on insurance contracts with residents of that State even though such corporations cannot be served with process within its borders.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nUnable to collect the judgment in California petitioner went to Texas where she filed suit on the judgment in a Texas court. But the Texas courts refused to enforce her judgment holding it was void under the Fourteenth Amendment because service of process outside California could not give the courts of that State jurisdiction over respondent. 288 S. W. 2d 579. Since the case raised important questions, not only to California but to other States which have similar laws, we granted certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 924\n. It is not controverted that if the California court properly exercised jurisdiction over respondent the Texas courts erred in refusing to give its judgment full faith and credit. 28 U.S.C. 1738.\n\nThe material facts are relatively simple. In 1944, Lowell Franklin, a resident of California, purchased a life insurance policy from the Empire Mutual Insurance Company, an Arizona corporation. In 1948 the respondent agreed with Empire Mutual to assume its insurance obligations. Respondent then mailed a reinsurance certificate to Franklin in California offering to insure him in accordance with the terms of the policy he held with Empire Mutual. He accepted this offer and from that \n\n[355 \nU.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n time until his death in 1950 paid premiums by mail from his California home to respondent's Texas office. Petitioner, Franklin's mother, was the beneficiary under the policy. She sent proofs of his death to the respondent but it refused to pay claiming that he had committed suicide. It appears that neither Empire Mutual nor respondent has ever had any office or agent in California. And so far as the record before us shows, respondent has never solicited or done any insurance business in California apart from the policy involved here.\n\nSince Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n, this Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment places some limit on the power of state courts to enter binding judgments against persons not served with process within their boundaries. But just where this line of limitation falls has been the subject of prolific controversy, particularly with respect to foreign corporations. In a continuing process of evolution this Court accepted and then abandoned \"consent,\" \"doing business,\" and \"presence\" as the standard for measuring the extent of state judicial power over such corporations. See Henderson, The Position of Foreign Corporations in American Constitutional Law, c. V. More recently in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, \n326 \nU.S. 310\n, the Court decided that \"due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'\" Id., at 316.\n\nLooking back over this long history of litigation a trend is clearly discernible toward expanding the permissible scope of state jurisdiction over foreign corporations and other nonresidents. In part this is attributable to the fundamental transformation of our national economy over the years. Today many commercial transactions \n\n[355 \nU.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n touch two or more States and may involve parties separated by the full continent. With this increasing nationalization of commerce has come a great increase in the amount of business conducted by mail across state lines. At the same time modern transportation and communication have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a State where he engages in economic activity.\n\nTurning to this case we think it apparent that the Due Process Clause did not preclude the California court from entering a judgment binding on respondent. It is sufficient for purposes of due process that the suit was based on a contract which had substantial connection with that State. Cf. Hess v. Pawloski, \n274 \nU.S. 352\n; Henry L. Doherty & Co. v. Goodman, \n294 \nU.S. 623\n; Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714, 735\n.\n2\n The contract was delivered in California, the premiums were mailed from there and the insured was a resident of that State when he died. It cannot be denied that California has a manifest interest in providing effective means of redress for its residents when their insurers refuse to pay claims. These residents would be at a severe disadvantage if they were forced to follow the insurance company to a distant State in order to hold it legally accountable. When claims were small or moderate individual claimants frequently could not afford the cost of bringing an action in a foreign forum - thus in effect making the company judgment proof. Often the crucial witnesses - as here on the company's defense of suicide - will be found in the insured's locality. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 220, 224]\n\u00a0\n Of course there may be inconvenience to the insurer if it is held amenable to suit in California where it had this contract but certainly nothing which amounts to a denial of due process. Cf. Travelers Health Assn. v. Virginia ex rel. State Corporation Comm'n, \n339 \nU.S. 643\n. There is no contention that respondent did not have adequate notice of the suit or sufficient time to prepare its defenses and appear.\n\nThe California statute became law in 1949, after respondent had entered into the agreement with Franklin to assume Empire Mutual's obligation to him. Respondent contends that application of the statute to this existing contract improperly impairs the obligation of the contract. We believe that contention is devoid of merit. The statute was remedial, in the purest sense of that term, and neither enlarged nor impaired respondent's substantive rights or obligations under the contract. It did nothing more than to provide petitioner with a California forum to enforce whatever substantive rights she might have against respondent. At the same time respondent was given a reasonable time to appear and defend on the merits after being notified of the suit. Under such circumstances it had no vested right not to be sued in California. Cf. Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516\n; National Surety Co. v. Architectural Decorating Co., \n226 \nU.S. 276\n; Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., \n290 \nU.S. 163\n.\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Civil Appeals of the State of Texas, First Supreme Judicial District, for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cal.

Of its purchases amounting to about $900,000 in one year, about $100,000 come from out of the State directly and as much or more indirectly. After a labor union had attempted unsuccessfully to organize Fairlawn's employees and Fairlawn had refused to recognize the union as the bargaining agent for its employees, the union picketed Fairlawn's stores and put some secondary pressure on its suppliers. Upon Fairlawn's complaint, an Ohio state court enjoined the union from picketing Fairlawn, from trespassing on its premises and from exerting secondary pressure on its suppliers. No effort was made to invoke the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board; but it is assumed that the Board would have declined jurisdiction and that it had not ceded jurisdiction under 10 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nRespondent operates three meat markets in the vicinity of Akron, Ohio. All of its sales are intrastate, but of its purchases in one year totaling not quite $900,000, slightly more than $100,000 worth came from outside Ohio directly and as much or more indirectly. Petitioner union, after an unsuccessful attempt to organize respondent's employees, asked respondent for recognition as their bargaining agent and for a union shop contract. When respondent refused to enter into such a contract, the union picketed respondent's stores and put some secondary pressure on its suppliers. Upon respondent's complaint, the Court of Common Pleas enjoined the union from picketing respondent, from trespassing upon respondent's premises and from exerting secondary pressure on the suppliers. Petitioners objected throughout that the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board was exclusive. On appeal, the Ohio Court of Appeals found that respondent's business was \"purely of a local character\" and interstate commerce, therefore, was not burdened or obstructed. The Court of Appeals held that the union's picketing was unlawful according to Ohio policy, and it continued in effect the injunction granted by the Court of Common Pleas.\n1\n The Ohio Supreme Court dismissed an appeal \"for the reason that no debatable constitutional question is involved.\"\n2\n We granted certiorari. \n351 \nU.S. 922\n.\n\nWe do not agree that respondent's interstate purchases were so negligible that its business cannot be said to affect interstate commerce within the meaning of 2 (7) of the National Labor Relations Act.\n3\n Cf. Labor Board v. Denver \n\n[353 \nU.S. 20, 23]\n\u00a0\n Building & Construction Trades Council, \n341 \nU.S. 675, 683\n-685. In this case, unlike No. 280, ante, p. 1, and No. 50, post, p. 26, no effort was made to invoke the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. Although the extent of respondent's interstate activity seems greater even than that in Building Trades Council v. Kinard Construction Co., \n346 \nU.S. 933\n, we will assume that this is a case where it was obvious that the Board would decline jurisdiction.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nOn this view of the case, our decision in Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board, ante, p. 1, controls. If the proviso to 10 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act operates to exclude state labor boards from disputes within the National Board's jurisdiction in the absence of a cession agreement, it must also exclude state courts. See Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485, 491\n. The conduct here restrained - an effort by a union not representing a majority of his employees to compel an employer to agree to a union shop contract - is conduct of which the National Act has taken hold. 8 (b) (2), 61 Stat. 141, 29 U.S.C. 158 (b) (2). Garner v. Teamsters Union, supra, teaches that in such circumstances a State cannot afford a remedy parallel to that provided by the Act.\n\nIt is urged in this case and its companions, however, that state action should be permitted within the area of commerce which the National Board has elected not to enter when such action is consistent with the policy of the National Act. We stated our belief in Guss v. Utah \n\n[353 \nU.S. 20, 24]\n\u00a0\n Labor Relations Board, ante, at pp. 10-11, that \"Congress has expressed its judgment in favor of uniformity.\" We add that Congress did not leave it to state labor agencies, to state courts or to this Court to decide how consistent with federal policy state law must be. The power to make that decision in the first instance was given to the National Labor Relations Board, guided by the language of the proviso to 10 (a). This case is an excellent example of one of the reasons why, it may be, Congress was specific in its requirement of uniformity. Petitioners here contend that respondent was guilty of what would be unfair labor practices under the National Act and that the outcome of proceedings before the National Board would, for that reason, have been entirely different from the outcome of the proceedings in the state courts. Without expressing any opinion as to whether the record bears out its factual contention, we note that the opinion of the Ohio Court of Appeals takes no account of the alleged unfair labor practice activity of the employer. Thus, it cannot be said with certainty whether the state court's decree is consistent with the National Act.\n\nOne final point remains to be considered. At two of respondent's stores, located in suburban shopping centers, the picketing occurred on land owned by or leased to respondent though open to the public for access to the stores. As one of the reasons for finding the picketing unlawful, the Court of Appeals recited this fact, and \"trespassing upon plaintiff's property\" is one of the activities specifically enjoined. Whether a State may frame and enforce an injunction aimed narrowly at a trespass of this sort is a question that is not here. Here the unitary judgment of the Ohio court was based on the erroneous premise that it had power to reach the union's conduct in its entirety. Whether its conclusion as to the mere act of trespass would have been the same outside of the context \n\n[353 \nU.S. 20, 25]\n\u00a0\n of petitioner's other conduct we cannot know. The judgment therefore is vacated and the case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Vacated and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n [For dissenting opinion of MR.

MICHIGAN(1957)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In a Michigan State Court in 1938, petitioner, a Negro then 17 years old and with only a seventh-grade education, said that he did not desire counsel, pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to solitary confinement at hard labor for life without possibility of parole, the maximum sentence permitted under Michigan law. In 1950, he filed a delayed motion for new trial, as permitted by Michigan law, claiming that his conviction and sentence were invalid because he did not have the assistance of counsel at the time of his plea and sentence. This motion was denied by the trial court and the State Supreme Court affirmed. It appeared from the record that, at the time of his trial, petitioner had several possible defenses involving questions of considerable technical difficulty obviously beyond his capacity to understand and that his waiver of counsel and plea of guilty may have been induced by fear of mob violence resulting from statements made to him by the Sheriff. Held: On the record in this case, petitioner had sustained his ultimate burden of proving that his plea of guilty was invalidly accepted without benefit of counsel and that he did not validly waive his right to counsel; and the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings. Pp. 156-165.\n\n (a) Petitioner's case falls within that class in which the intervention of counsel, unless intelligently waived, is an essential element of a fair hearing. P. 159.\n\n\n (b) The circumstances compel the conclusion that petitioner's rights could not have been fairly protected without the assistance of counsel. Pp. 159-160.\n\n\n (c) Where a person convicted in a state court has not intelligently and understandingly waived the benefit of counsel and where the circumstances show that his rights could not have been fairly protected without counsel, the Due Process Clause invalidates his conviction. Pp. 160-161.\n\n\n (d) Where the right to counsel is of such critical importance as to be an element of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment, a finding of waiver is not lightly to be made. P. 161. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 156]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (e) In this case, petitioner had the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he did not intelligently and understandingly waive his right to counsel. Pp. 161-162.\n\n\n (f) The fear of mob violence planted by the Sheriff in petitioner's mind raises an inference that his refusal of counsel was motivated by a desire to be removed from the local jail at the earliest possible moment; this is consistent with the trial judge's report of his interview with petitioner; and a rejection of federal constitutional rights motivated by fear cannot, in the circumstances of this case, constitute an intelligent waiver of counsel. Pp. 162-165.\n\n\n 344 Mich. 137, 73 N. W. 2d 274, reversed and cause remanded.\n\nWilliam H. Culver, acting under appointment by the Court, \n352 \nU.S. 958\n, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nSamuel J. Torina, Solicitor General of Michigan, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Thomas M. Kavanagh, Attorney General, Jacob A. Dalm, Jr. and J. Douglas Cook.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn October 29, 1938, the Circuit Court of Kalamazoo County, Michigan, accepted the petitioner's plea of guilty to an information charging him with the murder of an elderly white lady. He was sentenced to solitary confinement at hard labor for life in Michigan's Jackson Prison, where he has since been confined.\n1\n Petitioner, a Negro with a seventh-grade education, was 17 years old at the time. On May 26, 1950, he filed a delayed motion for a new trial in the Circuit Court. He asserted constitutional invalidity in his conviction and sentence because he did not have the assistance of counsel at the time of his plea and sentence. The Circuit Court, after hearing, denied the motion, and the Supreme Court of \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 157]\n\u00a0\n Michigan affirmed.\n2\n We granted certiorari to decide the important question raised involving a plea of guilty to a charge of murder where the accused was without the benefit of counsel.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe petitioner was arrested during the afternoon of October 26, 1938, a few hours after the murder was committed. He was confined in a Kalamazoo jail and was questioned by local law authorities from time to time until the afternoon of October 28, when he orally confessed to the crime.\n4\n On Saturday morning, October 29, 1938, he was arraigned in the Circuit Court where he pleaded guilty, was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree, and, after sentence, was transferred from the Kalamazoo jail to the Jackson Prison.\n\nIn accordance with the then prevailing procedure no stenographic transcript was taken of the proceedings in the Circuit Court at the time of the arraignment and plea. However, at the hearing held on the delayed motion for a new trial, two witnesses, who were present in the courtroom on October 29, 1938, testified as to what then transpired. On the basis of their testimony the Circuit Court in denying the motion for new trial found as a fact - which finding is, of course, accepted by us - that before the petitioner tendered the plea of guilty the trial judge asked the petitioner \"whether he had a lawyer and \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 158]\n\u00a0\n whether he desired to have a lawyer, and that [the petitioner] gave a negative reply to both of these inquiries, and stated that he wanted to get the matter over with.\"\n\nThe record further discloses that at the arraignment the trial judge, acting in conformity with Michigan procedure, which required him to conduct an investigation into the voluntariness of any plea of guilty,\n5\n conferred privately with petitioner for \"some five to ten minutes\" in chambers. Upon the return of the judge and petitioner to the courtroom, the judge stated that the plea would be accepted and proceeded to conduct the hearing required by Michigan law\n6\n to determine the degree of the offense of murder. At this hearing several witnesses testified to the details of the crime. The petitioner took no part in the examination of these witnesses nor did he testify. At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial judge pronounced judgment that the petitioner was guilty of murder in the first degree, and imposed sentence.\n\nThe judge made a statement, stenographically transcribed, that, over the previous three years, the petitioner had \"been in trouble four or five times, consisting of breaking and entering and unlawful taking of automobiles\" and had been handled as a juvenile offender on such occasions. He also stated that the petitioner had \"discussed the whole affair [the murder] very freely with me in all its revolting details\" and that \"in my private interview with respondent, I assured him that he must not plead guilty unless he really is guilty; that he was not required to plead guilty; that he could have a trial by jury if he desired it. He assured me freely and voluntarily that he is guilty and that his one desire is to have it all over, to get to the institution to which he is to be \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 159]\n\u00a0\n committed, and to be under observation and to be examined. . . .\" The judge at this point recited the details of the crime as told to him by the petitioner and then stated: \"Such is his story to me in private, told very calmly; without any compulsion whatever. He insists that there is something wrong with his head; that he has had something akin to queer sensations before this.\"\n\nWe may reasonably infer from the record that neither the trial judge nor the Michigan courts which considered the delayed motion thought that the petitioner's plight required the assistance of counsel to satisfy the requisites of the fair hearing secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in a state prosecution. The principles determining the extent to which this constitutional right to counsel is secured in a state prosecution have been discussed in a long series of decisions of this Court.\n7\n We hold that the petitioner's case falls within that class in which the intervention of counsel, unless intelligently waived by the accused, is an essential element of a fair hearing.\n\nThe petitioner was 17 years of age and had a seventh-grade education. Cf. De Meerleer v. Michigan, \n329 \nU.S. 663\n; Wade v. Mayo, \n334 \nU.S. 672\n; Williams v. Huff, 79 U.S. App. D.C. 326, 146 F.2d 867. He was charged with \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 160]\n\u00a0\n a crime carrying Michigan's maximum penalty, viz., solitary confinement at hard labor for life without possibility of parole. Mich. Stat. Ann., 1954, 28.548, 28.2304. Cf. Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n. The record shows possible defenses which might reasonably have been asserted at trial, but the extent of their availability raised questions of considerable technical difficulty obviously beyond his capacity to comprehend. For instance, one possible defense was insanity, suggested by the trial judge's statements that \"his one desire is to have it all over, to get to the institution to which he is to be committed, and to be under observation and to be examined . . .\"; \"he insists that there is something wrong with his head; that he has had something akin to queer sensations before this.\" Another possible defense was mistaken identity, suggested by the fact that the evidence pointing to him as the perpetrator of the crime was entirely circumstantial. Cf. Pennsylvania ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, \n350 \nU.S. 116\n; Rice v. Olson, \n324 \nU.S. 786\n. Moreover, the proceedings to determine the degree of murder, the outcome of which determined the extent of punishment, introduced their own complexities. With the aid of counsel, the petitioner, who, as we have said, neither testified himself in the proceeding nor cross-examined the prosecution's witnesses, might have done much to establish a lesser degree of the substantive crime, or to establish facts and make arguments which would have mitigated the sentence. The right to counsel is not a right confined to representation during the trial on the merits. Reece v. Georgia, \n350 \nU.S. 85\n. The circumstances compel the conclusion that the petitioner's rights could not have been fairly protected without the assistance of counsel to help him with his defense.\n\nHowever, we may also infer from the record that the Michigan courts held that even if petitioner was constitutionally entitled to the assistance of counsel he waived \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 161]\n\u00a0\n this right when he told the trial judge that \"he didn't want one, didn't have one, he wanted to get it over with.\" The constitutional right, of course, does not justify forcing counsel upon an accused who wants none. See Carter v. Illinois, \n329 \nU.S. 173, 174\n. But, \"where a person convicted in a state court has not intelligently and understandingly waived the benefit of counsel and where the circumstances show that his rights could not have been fairly protected without counsel, the Due Process Clause invalidates his conviction . . . .\" Pennsylvania ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, \n350 \nU.S. 116, 118\n. Where the right to counsel is of such critical importance as to be an element of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment, a finding of waiver is not lightly to be made. Cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 464\n; Glasser v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 60, 70\n; Von Moltke v. Gillies, \n332 \nU.S. 708, 723\n.\n\nThis Court held in Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, that when a judgment of conviction entered in a federal court is collaterally attacked upon the ground that the defendant did not have the benefit of counsel, he has the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he did not have counsel and did not competently and intelligently waive his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. We have found that the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of counsel to secure the fair hearing guaranteed to him by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Whatever may be the differences in the substantive right to counsel in federal and state cases, when the defendant in a state case has established his constitutional right to the benefit of counsel, he should carry the same burden of proving nonwaiver as is required of a defendant in a federal case. We therefore hold that the rule of Johnson v. Zerbst applies in this case and that the petitioner had the burden of showing, by a \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 162]\n\u00a0\n preponderance of the evidence, that he did not intelligently and understandingly waive his right to counsel.\n\nNotwithstanding the petitioner's express disavowal, before his plea, of a desire for counsel, the petitioner developed evidence at the hearing on the delayed motion which sustained his burden of showing that the disavowal was not intelligently and understandingly made and hence was not a waiver. Williams v. Huff, 79 U.S. App. D.C. 326, 146 F.2d 867. This crucial evidence, apparently not known to the trial judge, was brought out on the cross-examination of the Sheriff of Kalamazoo County at the hearing on the delayed motion, and concerned conversations between the Sheriff and the petitioner before the petitioner orally confessed on the afternoon of October 28, 1938:\n\n \"Q. You didn't advise him it would probably be best to plead guilty?\n\n\n \"A. Well, the only way I could answer that right is just to give you a little of the conversation there, perhaps, if you wish me to.\n\n\n \"Q. Relate that, that will probably be helpful.\n\n\n \"A. In talking with Willie Moore - that was before he had made any statement - I told him that if he was guilty of it he might better own up on it because I says there could be trouble. Tension is very high outside and there could be trouble. If you are not guilty of it, why then, I says, I would stand pat forever after. Then I told - I spoke to him about what would be required of him and I would have to take him to the Municipal Court for his arraignment in the lower court and then back over there, and I told him he would be entitled to a hearing in lower court and I says, `There you will have the Judge read to you and you can waive or demand an examination. You are entitled to an examination over there. It is \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 163]\n\u00a0\n my duty, and it is up to me, to protect you, to use every effort at my command to protect you,' but, I says, `the tension is high out there and I am just telling you what could happen if it was started by someone.' I don't know the language I used.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Q. Did you also tell him if he plead guilty he would be sent to Jackson immediately? Do you remember saying anything like that?\n\n\n \"A. I don't know as I come out and said at any time for him to plead one way or the other, but what I was putting over to him was the fact that if you are guilty and will be sent away you might better be getting away before trouble because I had had information there was certain colored fellows, a group of them, that was going to interfere with me, and also that there was a bunch of Holland fellows going to meet me when I go to Jackson, they would meet me there at Galesburg there, and, therefore, when he was sentenced I avoided the main route and went way through by Gull Lake and across over in the hills there.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n Although the trial judge rejected the petitioner's testimony as not worthy of belief, in this instance the Sheriff corroborated the petitioner's testimony, given before the Sheriff took the stand, that the Sheriff had told him \"that if I didn't plead guilty to this crime, they couldn't protect me, under those conditions, they says, during the riot, that they didn't know what people they would do, and that they couldn't protect me.\" Petitioner further testified that he pleaded guilty because of that statement of the Sheriff: \"After the man tell me he couldn't protect me then there wasn't nothing I could do. I was mostly scared than anything else.\" \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 164]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Circuit Court found the Sheriff's testimony insignificant because other evidence showed that there was in fact \"no threat of mob violence, no congregation of anything that could by any stretch of reasoning be considered a mob or a riotous gathering, and that while the Sheriff felt inclined to take certain precautions and did take certain precautions to avoid any trouble, there was nothing in the situation then existing to indicate that the Respondent had been coerced into a false plea, or that he had been placed in fear of insisting upon his constitutional rights.\" But plainly it is of no moment to the inquiry that the situation described to the petitioner by the Sheriff did not exist. The petitioner saw only law officers while being held continuously in close confinement from a time just hours after the murder until he orally confessed, and was hardly in a position to know or test the accuracy of what the Sheriff told him. The Sheriff's statement must be evaluated for its effect upon the capacity of this 17-year-old Negro youth of limited education and mental capacity to make an intelligent, understanding waiver of constitutional rights of supreme importance to him in his situation.\n\nWe believe that the expectation of mob violence, planted by the Sheriff in the mind of this then 17-year-old Negro youth, raises an inference of fact that his refusal of counsel was motivated to a significant extent by the desire to be removed from the Kalamazoo jail at the earliest possible moment. The trial judge's report of his interview with the petitioner is consistent with this inference in that the report states that the petitioner told the judge that \"his one desire is to have it all over, to get to the institution to which he is to be committed, and to be under observation and to be examined.\" A rejection of federal constitutional rights motivated by fear cannot, in the circumstances of this case, constitute an intelligent waiver. This conclusion against an intelligent waiver is \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 165]\n\u00a0\n fortified by the inferences which may be drawn from the age of petitioner, Williams v. Huff, 79 U.S. App. D.C. 326, 146 F.2d 867, and the evidence of emotional disturbance, Hallowell v. United States, 197 F.2d 926.\n\nWe thus conclude that the petitioner had sustained his ultimate burden of proving that his plea of guilty was invalidly accepted as obtained without the benefit of counsel and that he did not waive his right to counsel.\n\nThe judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Michigan long ago abolished capital punishment.

JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concur, dissenting.\n\nThe Court's decision rests upon its view that, despite the contrary conclusions of the Circuit and Supreme Courts of Michigan, petitioner has shown that he was in fact so alarmed that he was not able freely, intelligently and understandingly to plead guilty and to waive his right to counsel. But for that issue, this case should be summarily affirmed on the authority of Quicksall v. Michigan, \n339 \nU.S. 660\n, which dealt with a comparable situation that arose before the same trial judge under like procedure.\n\nThe only contemporaneous evidence as to petitioner's attitude and equanimity at the time of his trial, in 1938, is the statement which Circuit Judge Weimer made while presiding at the trial. He made it following his private interview with petitioner, and immediately preceding his acceptance of petitioner's plea of guilty. He portrayed petitioner as having, in that interview, \"very calmly; without any compulsion whatever\" \"freely and voluntarily\" discussed his crime, his guilt and \"his one desire . . . to have it all over . . . .\" When making \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 166]\n\u00a0\n this statement the judge's attention was focused directly upon his responsibility to determine the capacity of petitioner to plead guilty and to waive his constitutional privileges. The statement accordingly commands respect and is entitled to great weight.\n\nBy 1950, Judge Weimer had died and the prosecuting attorney, who had conducted the trial for the State, had suffered a stroke rendering him incapable of testifying. However, two witnesses did testify, in 1950, as to their recollection of petitioner's demeanor in 1938.\n\nOne was the chief deputy sheriff, who, in 1938, as a deputy sheriff, had been in charge of taking petitioner to and from the courtroom and to the lobby when petitioner was leaving for the penitentiary. His testimony included the following:\n\n \"Q. What did you notice, if anything, about his appearance that would have anything to do with the question whether or not he appeared to be in fear or relaxed or what?\n\n\n \"A. He was very relaxed. There was no sign of fear and no showing, either physically or by speech.\n\n\n \"Q. Anything that would lead you to that conclusion?\n\n\n \"A. To not being in fear?\n\n\n \"Q. Yes.\n\n\n \"A. He was nonchalant. . . .\"\n\n\n The other witness was a Circuit Judge, who, in 1938, had participated, as an assistant prosecutor, in the interrogation of petitioner when the latter confessed his crime. This witness testified:\n\n\". . . I, of course, felt that his answers were fair - were honest and candid in his final statement that he made. That is just my opinion, but he answered the questions that were put to him. To me he seemed very calm and not excited in the least. He \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 167]\n\u00a0\n spoke about it quite in a matter of fact way. His whole attitude was such that it was hard for me to understand his lack of emotion in telling the story of just what happened or what he claimed happened, what he did and what she did.\"\n\n\n As against this, petitioner offered his own statement, quoted by the Court, ante, p. 163. Judge Sweet, who presided in 1950, gave little credence to it and said in his opinion:\n\n\"While this Court has not disregarded the testimony of the [petitioner], but on the contrary has carefully considered it, it is the conclusion of this Court that the [petitioner's] testimony is not worthy of belief. This conclusion is arrived at because of the manner of the witness while testifying, his interest in the outcome of these proceedings, and the many points of conflict between his testimony and the testimony of the two witnesses herein referred to.\"\n*\n\u00a0\n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 168]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n This leaves for consideration the sheriff's statement, quoted by the Court, ante, pp. 162-163. His recollection was that he told petitioner that, as sheriff, it was his duty to protect petitioner and that he would use every effort at his command to do so, but that he added \"`the tension is high out there and I am just telling you what could happen if it was started by someone.' I don't know the language I used.\" He did not testify as to petitioner's mental or emotional condition. Furthermore, his recollection as to what he had said about tension must be read in comparison with the abundant testimony of others supporting Judge Sweet's conclusion that, in 1938, there had been little community tension and \"no threat of mob violence . . . .\" That the judge discounted the effect of the sheriff's testimony appears from his denial of petitioner's motion on the express ground that he believed that petitioner's plea of guilty \"was freely and voluntarily made . . . .\"\n\nThe issue is one of fact as to what occurred 19 years ago. Three times the state courts have concluded that petitioner acted freely, intelligently and understandingly. On this record, I would affirm that judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The following are examples of the conflicts presented by petitioner's testimony:\n\nHe testified that a large number of people hammered at his cell door, whereas the sheriff and deputy sheriffs denied this and said that it was physically impossible for a group of people to reach petitioner's cell and that his cell door was not of a type conducive to hammering.\n\nPetitioner said that the judge, in arraigning him, did not inform him of his right to counsel. Several witnesses testified to the contrary and Judge Sweet, presiding at the hearing on the delayed motion, said:\n\n\"It is the further conclusion of this Court that before such plea was accepted by the late Judge Weimer, the [petitioner] was informed of his right to a trial by jury and of his right to be represented by counsel, and that the [petitioner] indicated his desire to proceed without counsel and without a trial, and his desire to have his plea of guilty received by the Court and sentence imposed without further delay.\"\n\n\n Petitioner, in testifying as to what took place at his private interview with Judge Weimer, said repeatedly and unequivocally that the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 168]\n\u00a0\n sheriff came with petitioner into the judge's chambers and not only was present, but did much of the talking and leading of petitioner's examination. The sheriff and others, however, testified that it was the sheriff's practice not to attend such private sessions of the judge, and that the sheriff was not present on this occasion which Judge Weimer described as his \"private interview\" with petitioner. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 155, 169]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOREY v. DOUD(1957)\nNo. 475\nArgued: April 24, 1957Decided: June 24, 1957\n\n\n\n\n The Illinois Community Currency Exchanges Act provides for the licensing, inspection, bonding and regulation of \"currency exchanges\" engaged in the business of issuing or selling money orders. It forbids them to do business on the premises of any other business; but it exempts from all of its provisions money orders sold or issued by the American Express Co., an old, established, world-wide enterprise of unquestioned solvency and high financial standing, which sells money orders through local drug and grocery stores. Appellees, a \"currency exchange\" issuing and selling money orders and its agent selling them in his own drugstore, sued to enjoin enforcement of the Act against them, on the ground of its unconstitutionality. Held: Application of the Act to appellees denies them the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 458-470.\n\n (a) The Equal Protection Clause does not require that every state regulatory statute apply to all in the same business; but a statutory discrimination must be based on differences that are reasonably related to the purposes of the statute. Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553\n. Pp. 465-466.\n\n\n (b) Moreover, a discrimination cannot be justified by different business characteristics when it has no reasonable relation to those differences. Hartford Co. v. Harrison, \n301 \nU.S. 459\n. P. 466.\n\n\n (c) The discrimination in favor of the American Express Co. here involved does not have a reasonable relation to the purposes of the Act or to different business characteristics. Pp. 466-467.\n\n\n (d) The effect of the discrimination here involved is to create a closed class by singling out American Express money orders for exemption from the requirements of the Act. Pp. 467-468.\n\n\n (e) The exemption of its money orders gives the American Express Co. important economic and competitive advantages over appellees. Pp. 468-469. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 458]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (f) Taking these factors in conjunction, application of the Act to appellees deprives them of equal protection of the laws. P. 469.\n\n\n (g) This case need not be remitted to the Illinois courts for a determination whether the exception can be severed from the Act under its severability clause, because the Supreme Court of Illinois has indicated rather clearly that the exception is not severable. Pp. 469-470.\n\n\n 146 F. Supp. 887, affirmed.\n\nWilliam C. Wines, Assistant Attorney General of Illinois, argued the cause for appellants. With him on the brief were Latham Castle, Attorney General, Ben Schwartz, Assistant Attorney General, and Benjamin S. Adamowski.\n\nG. Kent Yowell and John J. Yowell argued the cause and filed a brief for appellees.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case concerns the validity of a provision in the Illinois Community Currency Exchanges Act, as amended,\n1\n excepting money orders of the American Express Company from the requirement that any firm selling or issuing money orders in the State must secure a license and submit to state regulation. The objection raised is that this exception results in a denial of equal protection of the laws, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, to those who are subjected to the requirements of the Act. For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that the Act is invalid as applied to them because of this discriminatory exception.\n\nThe appellees in this case are Doud, McDonald and Carlson, partners doing business as Bondified Systems, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 459]\n\u00a0\n and Derrick, their agent. The partnership has an exclusive right to sell \"Bondified\" money orders in Illinois, directly or through agents.\n2\n It contemplates selling these money orders in Illinois through agents principally engaged in operating retail drug or grocery stores. Derrick is the proprietor of a drugstore in Illinois and operates a \"Bondified\" agency in that store.\n\nFearing enforcement against them of the provisions of the Act, these four individuals instituted this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the appellants, who are the Auditor of Public Accounts of the State of Illinois, the Attorney General of that State, and the State's Attorney of Cook County. The complaint alleged that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it unlawfully discriminated against the complainants and in favor of the American Express Company. An injunction against the enforcement of the Act was sought. Since the complaint attacked the validity of a state statute under the Constitution of the United States, the case was heard by a three-judge District Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281, 2284.\n\nAfter hearing evidence, the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to determine the constitutional question in the absence of an authoritative determination of that question by the Supreme Court of Illinois. 127 F. Supp. 853. On appeal, this Court held that the District Court erred in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction, and remanded it to the District Court. \n350 \nU.S. 485\n.\n\nOn remand, the District Court considered on the merits the evidence previously heard, and unanimously held that \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause and that appellees were entitled to the relief sought. 146 F. Supp. 887.\n3\n The decree enjoined appellants from enforcing the Act against appellees so long as they engage only in the business of issuing and selling money orders. The case came here on direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1253, and we noted probable jurisdiction. \n352 \nU.S. 923\n.\n\nDuring the early 1930's, the closing of many banks in the Chicago area led to the development of simple banking facilities called currency exchanges. The principal activities of these exchanges were the cashing of checks for a fee and the selling of money orders. The fact that many of these exchanges went into business without adequate capital and without sufficient safeguards to protect the public resulted in the enactment of the Illinois Community Currency Exchanges Act in 1943.\n\nThis Act and its amendments provide a comprehensive scheme for the licensing and regulation of currency exchanges. The operation of a community currency exchange without a license is made a crime. 32. An applicant for a license must submit specified information and pay an investigation fee of $25. 34. A license cannot be issued unless the State Auditor determines that its issuance will \"promote the convenience and advantage of the community in which the business of the applicant is proposed to be conducted . . . .\" 34.1.\n4\n A surety bond of between $3,000 and $25,000, and an insurance policy of between $2,500 and $35,000 must be \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n filed. 35, 36. An annual license fee of $50 is required. 44.\n\nA licensed exchange must maintain a minimum of $3,000 available in cash for the uses and purposes of its business, plus an amount of liquid funds sufficient to pay on demand all outstanding money orders issued. 37. Each exchange must be an entity, financed and conducted as a separate business unit, and not conducted as a department of another business. No community currency exchange \"hereafter licensed for the first time shall share any room with any other business, trade or profession nor shall it occupy any room from which there is direct access to a room occupied by any other business, trade or profession.\" 38. Only one place of business may be maintained under one license, although more than one license may be issued to a licensee. 43. Annual financial reports must be submitted and the State Auditor has a duty to investigate each exchange at least once a year. A fee of $20 must be paid for each day or part thereof of investigation. 46.\n\nThe following definition of a \"community currency exchange\" is crucial to this case:\n\n \"`Community currency exchange' means any person, firm, association, partnership or corporation, except banks incorporated under the laws of this State and National Banks organized pursuant to the laws of the United States, engaged at a fixed and permanent place of business, in the business or service of, and providing facilities for, cashing checks, drafts, money orders or any other evidences of money acceptable to such community currency exchange, for a fee or service charge or other consideration, or engaged in the business of selling or issuing money orders under his or their or its name, or any other money orders (other than United States Post Office money orders, American Express Company money \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 462]\n\u00a0\n order[s], Postal Telegraph Company money orders, or Western Union Telegraph Company money orders), or engaged in both such businesses, or engaged in performing any one or more of the foregoing services.\" (Emphasis supplied.) 31.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n As the activities of appellees concededly come within this definition of a \"community currency exchange,\" the partnership and its druggist agent are subject to the licensing and regulatory provisions of the Act. Consequently, since the Act bars the sale of money orders as a part of another business, the partnership is precluded from establishing outlets for the sale of \"Bondified\" money orders in drug and grocery stores, and Derrick is unable to secure a license for the sale of those money orders in his store. 38. Even if the partnership establishes outlets which are not a part of other businesses, those outlets will be licensed to sell \"Bondified\" money orders only if they show that the \"convenience and advantage of the community\" in which they propose to do business will be promoted by the issuance of licenses to them. 34.1. Finally, any \"Bondified\" outlets will each have to pay the specified licensing and inspection fees and each will have to secure the required surety bond and insurance policy. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 463]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe American Express Company, on the other hand, because its money orders are excepted, is relieved of these licensing and regulatory requirements, and appears to be exempt from any regulation in Illinois. The American Express Company, an unincorporated joint stock association organized in 1868 under the laws of New York, conducts a world-wide business which includes the sale of money orders. It sells money orders in Illinois in substantially the same manner as is contemplated by the \"Bondified\" partnership, through authorized agents located in drug and grocery stores. Since American Express money orders are not subject to the Act, they are sold legally in those stores as a part of their business. American Express outlets may be established without regard to the \"convenience and advantage\" of the community in which they operate. Finally, those outlets need not pay licensing and inspection fees nor file surety bonds and insurance policies with the State.\n\nIn determining the constitutionality of the Act's application to appellees in the light of its exception of American Express money orders, we start with the established proposition that the \"prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.\" Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., \n348 \nU.S. 483, 489\n. The rules for testing a discrimination have been summarized as follows:\n\n\"1. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not take from the State the power to classify in the adoption of police laws, but admits of the exercise of a wide scope of discretion in that regard, and avoids what is done only when it is without any reasonable basis and therefore is purely arbitrary. 2. A classification having some reasonable basis does not offend against that clause merely because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 464]\n\u00a0\n 3. When the classification in such a law is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed. 4. One who assails the classification in such a law must carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis, but is essentially arbitrary.\" Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n-79.\n\n\n To these rules we add the caution that \"Discriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to the constitutional provision.\" Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 37\n-38; Hartford Co. v. Harrison, \n301 \nU.S. 459, 462\n.\n\nThe Act creates a statutory class of sellers of money orders. The money orders sold by one company, American Express, are excepted from that class. There is but one \"American Express Company.\" If the exception is to be upheld, it must be on the basis on which it is cast - an exception of a particular business entity and not of a generic category.\n\nThe purpose of the Act's licensing and regulatory provisions clearly is to protect the public when dealing with currency exchanges.\n6\n Because the American Express Company is a world-wide enterprise of unquestioned solvency and high financial standing, the State argues that the legislative classification is reasonable. It contends that the special characteristics of the American Express Company justify excepting its money orders from the requirements of an Act aimed at local companies doing \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 465]\n\u00a0\n local business,\n7\n and that appellees are in no position to complain about competitive disadvantages since the \"Fourteenth Amendment does not protect a business against the hazards of competition,\" citing Hegeman Farms Corp. v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 163, 170\n.\n\nThat the Equal Protection Clause does not require that every state regulatory statute apply to all in the same business is a truism. For example, where size is an index to the evil at which the law is directed, discriminations between the large and the small are permissible.\n8\n Moreover, we have repeatedly recognized that \"reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.\" Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., \n348 \nU.S. 483, 489\n. On the other hand, a statutory discrimination must be based on differences that are reasonably related to the purposes of the Act in which it is found.\n9\n Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553\n, involved a state statute which required motor vehicles, operating on local highways as carriers for hire, to furnish bonds or insurance policies for the protection of the public against injuries received through negligence in these operations. The Act excepted motor vehicles carrying specified products. This Court held that \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 466]\n\u00a0\n the exception violated the Equal Protection Clause since the statutory purpose of protecting the public could not reasonably support a discrimination between the carrying of exempt products like farm produce and of regulated products like groceries. \"`Such a classification is not based on anything having relation to the purpose for which it is made.'\" Id., at 567.\n\nOf course, distinctions in the treatment of business entities engaged in the same business activity may be justified by genuinely different characteristics of the business involved.\n10\n This is so even where the discrimination is by name.\n11\n But distinctions cannot be so justified if the \"discrimination has no reasonable relation to these differences.\" Hartford Co. v. Harrison, \n301 \nU.S. 459, 463\n. In that case, this Court held that a state statute which permitted mutual insurance companies to act through salaried resident employees, but which excluded stock insurance companies from the same privilege, violated the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThe principles controlling in the Smith and Hartford Co. cases, supra, are applicable here. The provisions in the Illinois Act, such as those requiring an annual inspection of licensed community currency exchanges by the State Auditor, make it clear that the statute was intended to afford the public continuing protection. The discrimination in favor of the American Express Company does not conform to this purpose. The exception of its money \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 467]\n\u00a0\n orders apparently rests on the legislative hypothesis that the characteristics of the American Express Company make it unnecessary to regulate their sales. Yet these sales, by virtue of the exception, will continue to be unregulated whether or not the American Express Company retains its present characteristics. On the other hand, sellers of competing money orders are subject to the Act even though their characteristics are, or become, substantially identical with those the American Express Company now has. Moreover, the Act's blanket exception takes no account of the characteristics of the local outlets that sell American Express money orders, and the distinct possibility that they in themselves may afford less protection to the public than do the retail establishments that sell competing money orders. That the American Express Company is a responsible institution operating on a world-wide basis does not minimize the fact that when the public buys American Express money orders in local drug and grocery stores it relies in part on the reliability of the selling agents.\n\nThe effect of the discrimination is to create a closed class by singling out American Express money orders. The singling out of the money orders of one company is in a sense the converse of a case like Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co., \n183 \nU.S. 79, 114\n-115. See also, McFarland v. American Sugar Co., \n241 \nU.S. 79\n. In the Cotting case this Court held that a regulatory statute that in fact applied to only one stockyard in a State violated the Equal Protection Clause. Although statutory discriminations creating a closed class have been upheld,\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 468]\n\u00a0\n a statute which established a closed class was held to violate the Equal Protection Clause where, on its face, it was \"an attempt to give an economic advantage to those engaged in a given business at an arbitrary date as against all those who enter the industry after that date.\" Mayflower Farms, Inc. v. Ten Eyck, \n297 \nU.S. 266, 274\n. The statute involved in that case granted a differential from the regulated price at which dealers could sell milk to those dealers in a specified class who were in business before April 10, 1933.\n\nUnlike the American Express Company, appellees and others are barred from selling money orders in retail establishments. Even if competing outlets can successfully be established as separate businesses, their ability to secure licenses depends upon a showing of \"convenience and advantage.\" Perhaps such a showing could not be made because the unregulated American Express Company had already established outlets in the community. And even if licenses were secured, the licensees would be required to pay licensing and investigatory fees and purchase surety bonds and insurance policies - costs that the American Express Company and its agents are not required to bear.\n13\n The fact that the activities of the American Express Company are far-flung does not minimize the impact on local affairs and on competitors of its sale of money orders in Illinois. This is not a case in which the Fourteenth Amendment is being invoked to protect a business from the general hazards of competition. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 469]\n\u00a0\n The hazards here have their roots in the statutory discrimination.\n\nTaking all of these factors in conjunction - the remote relationship of the statutory classification to the Act's purpose or to business characteristics, and the creation of a closed class by the singling out of the money orders of a named company, with accompanying economic advantages - we hold that the application of the Act to appellees deprives them of equal protection of the laws.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nThe State urges that if the exception of American Express money orders is unconstitutional, the case should be remitted to the Illinois courts for a determination whether the exception can be severed from the Act under its severability clause. 56.3. However, even if such \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 470]\n\u00a0\n a procedure is otherwise appropriate,\n15\n we deem it unnecessary here since the Supreme Court of Illinois has indicated rather clearly that the exception is not severable.\n16\n The State also contends that appellees do not come into court with clean hands and have not demonstrated the imminence of irreparable injury, and hence that they are not entitled to equitable relief. These arguments are adequately disposed of in the opinion of the District Court.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ill. Rev.

It noted that the Postal Telegraph Company has merged with the Western Union Telegraph Company.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See McDougall v. Lueder, 389 Ill. 141, 149-150, 58 N.

E. 520, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that the Equal Protection Clause was violated by a statute which excepted express, steamship and telegraph companies from its prohibition against the transmission of money to foreign countries by natural persons, firms or partnerships. That court concluded that the discrimination \"has no reference to character, solvency, financial responsibility, security, business or monetary facilities, incorporation, method of doing business, public inspection, supervision or report, or any other thing having any relation to the protection of the public from loss by reason of the dishonesty, incompetence, ignorance or irresponsibility of persons engaging in that business.\" 297 Ill., at 237, 130 N. E., at 523. See also, State on inf. Taylor v. Currency Services, Inc., 358 Mo. 983, 218 S. W. 600.\n\nThe Wedesweiler case was distinguished by the Supreme Court of Illinois in McDougall v. Lueder, 389 Ill. 141, 150, 58 N. E. 2d 899, 904, on the ground that in the earlier case the regulated firms were \"in direct competition\" with the excepted companies. Apparently the court treated the regulated firm in the McDougall case as not being in direct competition with the American Express Company since the firm was engaged in the business of cashing checks, as well as in that of selling money orders, while the American Express Company merely sold money orders. Such a distinction is not involved in the facts of this case and we express no opinion on it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347, 366\n; Myers v. Anderson, \n238 \nU.S. 368, 380\n-381; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 291\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] In McDougall v. Lueder, 389 Ill. 141, 151, 58 N. E. 2d 899, 904, the Supreme Court of Illinois stated that \"The General Assembly would surely never have passed the act if they had thought that the said companies [Western Union, Postal Telegraph and American Express] would be made subject to its rules and regulations.\" This statement takes on added significance in the light of the court's ruling in the same case that another provision of the Act, which it held invalid, could be severed since \"there is no presumption that the General Assembly would not have enacted the remainder of the statute without\" the invalid provision. 389 Ill., at 155, 58 N. E. 2d, at 906.\n\nAs the question of severability is a question of state law, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is binding here. See Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 290\n; Chas. Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, \n267 \nU.S. 552, 562\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] See Doud v. Hodge, 146 F. Supp. 887, 889-890.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nThe Illinois statute involved here provides a state-wide regulatory plan to protect the public from irresponsible and insolvent sellers of money orders. The Act specifically exempts the American Express Company's money orders from its regulatory provisions because, as the Court recognizes, that company \"is a world-wide enterprise \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 471]\n\u00a0\n of unquestioned solvency and high financial standing.\" I cannot agree with the Court that this exemption denies actual and potential competitors of the American Express Company equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Only recently this Court held that \"[t]he prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.\" Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 483, 489\n. And here, whatever one may think of the merits of this legislation, its exemption of a company of known solvency from a solvency test applied to others of unknown financial responsibility can hardly be called \"invidious.\" Unless state legislatures have power to make distinctions that are not plainly unreasonable, then the ability of the States to protect their citizens by regulating business within their boundaries can be seriously impaired. I feel it necessary to express once again my objection to the use of general provisions of the Constitution to restrict narrowly state power over state domestic economic affairs.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nI think state regulation should be viewed quite differently where it touches or involves freedom of speech, press, religion, petition, assembly, or other specific safeguards of the Bill of Rights. It is the duty of this Court to be alert to see that these constitutionally preferred rights are not abridged.\n2\n But the Illinois statute here \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 472]\n\u00a0\n does not involve any of these basic liberties. And since I believe that it is not \"invidiously discriminatory,\" I would not hold it invalid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, e. g., my dissents in H. P. Hood & Sons v. Du Mond, \n336 \nU.S. 525, 562\n-564; Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, \n320 \nU.S. 430, 462\n; Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46, 79\n-84. Cf. Tigner v.

JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nThe sole question before the Court is whether the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, in prohibiting a State from denying any person \"the equal protection of the laws,\" has barred Illinois from formulating its domestic policy as it did, in an area concededly within the regulatory power of that State. As is usually true of questions arising under the Equal Protection Clause, the answer will turn on the way in which that clause is conceived. It is because of differences in judicial approach that the divisions in the Court in applying the clause have been frequent and marked. It is, I believe, accurate to summarize the matter by saying that the great divide in the decisions lies in the difference between emphasizing the actualities or the abstractions of legislation.\n\nThe more complicated society becomes, the greater the diversity of its problems and the more does legislation direct itself to the diversities. Statutes, that is, are directed to less than universal situations. Law reflects distinctions that exist in fact or at least appear to exist in the judgment of legislators - those who have the responsibility for making law fit fact. Legislation is essentially empiric. It addresses itself to the more or less crude outside world and not to the neat, logical models of the mind. Classification is inherent in legislation; the Equal Protection Clause has not forbidden it. To recognize marked differences that exist in fact is living law; to disregard practical differences and concentrate on some abstract identities is lifeless logic. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 473]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe controlling importance of the differences in approach to a problem arising under the Equal Protection Clause is sharply illustrated by one's view of the decisions in cases like Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32\n, and Hartford Co. v. Harrison, \n301 \nU.S. 459\n. The Court relies on them. For me they are false leads. Both these decisions prevailed by the narrowest margin; both evoked powerful dissents; both manifest the requirement of nondiscriminatory classification as an exercise in logical abstractions. They breathe the spirit of decisions like Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 \nU.S. 540\n, and Colgate v. Harvey, \n296 \nU.S. 404\n, which were respectively overruled in Tigner v. Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 141\n, and Madden v. Kentucky, \n309 \nU.S. 83\n. The last two cases heeded the admonition that \"it is important for this court to avoid extracting from the very general language of the Fourteenth Amendment a system of delusive exactness . . . .\" Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Co., \n197 \nU.S. 430, 434\n.\n\nIn regulating its banking facilities, Illinois was drawing on one of the oldest and most far-reaching of legislative powers. The public needs to be protected in the issuing and selling of money orders, and people with limited means are especially to be safeguarded. If Illinois chose, the State itself could take over the money order business. See Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104, 113\n. Just as it was found that there was nothing in the Constitution of the United States to bar a State from engaging in the businesses of manufacturing and marketing farm products and of providing homes for its people, Green v. Frazier, \n253 \nU.S. 233\n, so, surely, there is nothing to prevent Illinois from engaging in this business directly, or through a money dispensary similar to the mode by which some States engage in the liquor business. I know of nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment that would bar the State from discharging its responsibility to \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 474]\n\u00a0\n its citizens by having the business conducted by what the Court recognizes to be \"a world-wide enterprise of unquestioned solvency and high financial standing,\" to wit, the American Express Co.\n\nI regretfully find myself unable to appreciate why the State, instead of thus dealing with the problem, may not choose to allow small units to carry on a business so fraught with public interests under the regulations devised by the statute under review, while at the same time it finds such measures of control needless in a case of \"a world-wide enterprise of unquestioned solvency and high financial standing.\" The rational differentiation is of course that the latter enterprise contains within itself, in the judgment of Illinois, the necessary safeguards for solvency and reliability in issuing money orders and redeeming them. Surely this is a distinction of significance in fact that the law cannot view with a glass eye.\n\nBut it is suggested that the American Express Co. may not continue to retain \"its present characteristics,\" while sellers of competing money orders may continue to be subject to the Act, even though their characteristics become \"substantially identical with those the American Express Co. now has.\" What is this but to deny a State the right to legislate on the basis of circumstances that exist because a State may not in speculatively different circumstances that may never come to pass have such right? Surely there is time enough to strike down legislation when its constitutional justification is gone. Invalidating legislation is serious business and it ought not to be indulged in because in a situation not now before the Court, nor even remotely probable, a valid statute may lose its foundation. The Court has had occasion to deal with such contingency more than once. Regulatory measures have been sustained that later, in changed circumstances, were found to be unconstitutional. Compare Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19\n, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 457, 475]\n\u00a0\n with Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n258 \nU.S. 165\n, and Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, with Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543\n.\n\n\"`Legislation which regulates business may well make distinctions depend upon the degree of evil.' Heath & Milligan Mfg. Co. v. Worst, \n207 \nU.S. 338, 355\n, 356. It is true, no doubt, that where size is not an index to an admitted evil the law cannot discriminate between the great and small. But in this case size is an index.\" Engel v. O'Malley, \n219 \nU.S. 128, 138\n. Neither the record nor our own judicial information affords any basis for concluding that Illinois may not put the United States Post Office, the Western Union Co., and the American Express Co. in one class and all the other money order issuers in another. Illinois may not the less relieve the American Express Co. from regulations to which multitudinous small issuers are subject because that company has its own reliabilities that may well be different from those of the United States Post Office and the Western Union Telegraph Co. The vital fact is that the American Express Co. is decisively different from those money order issuers that are within the regulatory scheme.\n\n\n Sociologically one may think what one may of the State's recognition of the special financial position obviously enjoyed by the American Express Co. Whatever one may think is none of this Court's business. In applying the Equal Protection Clause, we must be fastidiously careful to observe the admonition of Mr. Justice Brandeis, Mr. Justice Stone, and Mr. Justice Cardozo that we do not \"sit as a super-legislature.\" (See their dissenting opinion in the ill-fated case of Colgate v.

At that time, there was no statute making that offense a ground for deportation. After enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, he was ordered deported under 241 (a) (11) and (d) thereof, which provide for the deportation of any alien who \"at any time\" has been convicted of violating any law relating to illicit traffic in narcotics. He challenged the validity of this order in a habeas corpus proceeding. Held: the order of deportation is sustained. Lehmann v. United States ex rel. Carson, ante, p. 685.

He was taken into custody in May, 1953, and, after administrative proceedings, was ordered deported under 241 (a) (11) and (d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952,\n2\n which provides, inter alia, for the deportation of any alien \". . . who at any time has been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation relating to the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs . . . .\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\nRespondent petitioned the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for a writ of habeas corpus. The District Court, after hearing, denied the petition. The Court of Appeals reversed, 236 F.2d 955, holding - principally on the basis of its earlier decision in United States v. Kershner, 228 F.2d 142, this day reversed by us, sub nom. Lehmann v. United States ex rel. Carson, ante, p. 685 - that inasmuch as respondent's conviction in 1925 of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs was not a ground for deportation prior to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, respondent had a \"status\" of nondeportability \n\n[353 \nU.S. 692, 694]\n\u00a0\n which was preserved to him by the savings clause in 405 (a) of that Act.\n4\n We granted certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 915\n.\n\nAs we have said in Lehmann v. United States ex rel. Carson, ante, p. 685, 405 (a) by its own terms does not apply to situations \"otherwise specifically provided\" for in the Act. Section 241 (a) (11) and 241 (d) specifically provide for the deportation of an alien notwithstanding that the offense for which he is being deported occurred prior to the 1952 Act. Section 241 (a) (11) makes an alien deportable if he has \"at any time\" been convicted of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs. And 241 (d) makes 241 (a) (11) applicable to all aliens covered thereby \"notwithstanding . . . that the facts . . . occurred prior to the date of enactment of this Act.\" It seems to us indisputable, therefore, that Congress was legislating retrospectively, as it may do,\n5\n to cover offenses of the kind here involved. The case is, therefore, \"otherwise specifically provided\" for within the meaning of 405 (a).

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a companion case to No. 78. United States v. Allen-Bradley Co., ante, p. 306, which was also decided today. During World War II petitioner manufactured engine bearings. In 1944 petitioner expanded its plant in an effort to increase the output of these essential war products. At the same time it applied to the War Production Board for certification that the various additions were necessary in the interest of national defense. However the Board, as in Allen-Bradley, granted certificates of necessity for only a part of the cost of petitioner's new facilities. In its income tax return for 1944 petitioner exercised the privilege such certification conferred by taking as a deduction a sum based on the accelerated \n\n[352 \nU.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n amortization of that part of the costs which had been certified by the Board.\n\nIn 1951 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue asserted a deficiency against petitioner on grounds unrelated to the present controversy. Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for redetermination with the Tax Court claiming that it was entitled to a refund for overpayment of income taxes in 1944. The amount of this overpayment was calculated on the basis that petitioner was entitled to accelerate the amortization of the full cost of those facilities covered by the Board's \"partial certifications.\" Petitioner contends that the Board was not authorized to certify only a part of the cost of a facility when the Board had determined that the facility as a whole was necessary to the national defense. The Tax Court granted petitioner's claim, but on appeal the Second Circuit reversed, holding that petitioner had forfeited its right to challenge the Board's action by waiting too long after accepting the tax benefits of the \"partial certificates\" to attack their validity. 230 F.2d 161. The Court of Appeals did not reach the question whether the Board was authorized to issue such \"partial certificates.\" For reasons stated in our opinion in No. 78, United States v. Allen-Bradley Co., supra, we hold that the Board was empowered to issue certificates covering only a part of the cost of petitioner's improvements. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN joins in the Court's decision for the reasons stated in his concurring opinion in United States v.

UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 37\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In connection with a trial for conspiracy to violate the Federal Slot Machine Act, the court issued subpoenas duces tecum directing a corporation owned by one of the defendants to produce certain records of purchases and sales of slot machines. Petitioner, who was a vice-president of the corporation and an attorney of record for its owner, appeared on behalf of the corporation, produced certain records and stated that they were all of the subpoenaed records that he could find. Under court order, all records of the corporation were impounded by a Federal Marshal and among them were found records of purchases and sales of slot machines which petitioner had not produced. On the day after conviction of the defendants, the court ordered petitioner to appear four days later and show cause why he should not be held in criminal contempt for obstructing the administration of justice on three specifications. After a hearing, petitioner was found guilty of criminal contempt on all three specifications and was given a general sentence of imprisonment. On appeal, the Government abandoned two of the specifications but contended that the sentence should be sustained on the third. Held:\n\n 1. The conviction of criminal contempt on the third specification is sustained. Pp. 392-396.\n\n\n  (a) A criminal contempt is committed by one who, in response to a subpoena calling for corporate records, refuses to surrender them when they are in existence and within his control. P. 392.\n\n\n  (b) The evidence reasonably supports the conclusion that the records covered by the third specification were in existence and were within petitioner's control. Pp. 392-394.\n\n\n  (c) Although petitioner testified at his trial that he attempted in good faith to comply with the subpoenas, this testimony was subject to appraisal by the trial court, and the record contained sufficient basis to justify the court in concluding that petitioner's failure to comply with the subpoena was intentional and without \"adequate excuse\" within the meaning of Rule 17 (g) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. P. 395.\n\n\n  (d) In the circumstances of this case and in view of the wide discretion on such matters vested in the trial court, petitioner's \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 386]\n\u00a0\n claim that he was not allowed adequate time to prepare his defense is unfounded. P. 395.\n\n\n  (e) Trial of petitioner before the trial judge who initiated the contempt proceeding was not improper, because Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires disqualification of the trial judge only when \"the contempt charged involves disrespect to or criticism of a judge,\" the contempt here charged was not of that kind, and there is no showing in this case of an abuse of discretion in failing to assign another judge. Pp. 395-396.\n\n\n 2. Since petitioner's general sentence followed his conviction on three original specifications and the Government has abandoned two of them, the trial court should be given an opportunity to reconsider the sentence; and the sentence is vacated and the case is remanded to the trial court for that purpose. P. 396.\n\n\n 227 F.2d 74, 228 F.2d 134, judgment vacated and case remanded to the District Court.\n\nEugene Gressman argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was John W. Graff.\n\nRichard J. Blanchard argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney and Beatrice Rosenberg.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn this case, a Federal District Court convicted an attorney of criminal contempt on three specifications for disobeying subpoenas duces tecum, and imposed a general sentence of imprisonment for a year and a day. Since the Government has abandoned two of the specifications, the principal questions are whether there is sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction on the third specification standing alone, and, if so, whether the case should be remanded for resentencing. For the reasons hereafter stated, we answer each in the affirmative.\n\nIn 1953, in the District Court of the United States for the District of North Dakota, petitioner, Allen I. Nilva, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n was tried, with Elmo T. Christianson and Herman Paster, for conspiracy to violate the Federal Slot Machine Act, 64 Stat. 1134-1136, 15 U.S.C. 1171-1177. Christianson was the Attorney General of North Dakota. Paster was the owner of several distributing companies located in St. Paul, Minnesota. Petitioner was an attorney in St. Paul, a brother-in-law of Paster, and an officer in several of Paster's distributing companies. The indictment charged that these three conspired, with others, to accumulate slot machines late in 1950 and transport them into North Dakota, where they were to be distributed and operated under the protection of Christianson, who was to take office as Attorney General of that State on January 2, 1951.\n\nOn the first trial, in 1953, a jury was unable to agree on the guilt of Christianson and Paster but acquitted petitioner. In 1954, in preparation for a retrial of Christianson and Paster, the same court issued subpoenas duces tecum No. 78, returnable on March 22, and No. 160, returnable on March 29. Each was addressed to the Mayflower Distributing Company, a St. Paul slot machine distributing corporation wholly owned by Paster. Each called for the production of records, for certain periods in 1950 and 1951, relating to transactions in slot machines and other coin-operated devices.\n1\n Each was served on Walter D. Johnson, secretary-treasurer of the company.\n\nOn the date set for trial. Paster, instead of producing the subpoenaed records, moved to quash the subpoenas \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n on the ground that the company was wholly owned by him and that the subpoenas required him to furnish evidence against himself. The motion was denied and, in response to the Government's request, the court ordered the subpoenaed records to be produced \"forthwith.\"\n2\n Three days later, on April 1, petitioner, who was an attorney of record for Paster, appeared in court and stated that he was the company's vice-president appearing for it in answer to the subpoenas. He said that \"in response to this subpoena I personally, with the aid of people in the office force, searched all of our records in an attempt to comply with your subpoena and have brought all of the evidence I could to comply therewith.\" However, when the Government asked for the records of purchases and sales of slot machines called for by the subpoenas, he stated that he had been unable to locate them and suggested that some of the company's records had been transferred to St. Louis in connection with a conspiracy case pending there on appeal.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe trial court, being convinced, as it later stated, that petitioner was giving false and evasive testimony, issued \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 389]\n\u00a0\n an order reciting the failure of the officers of the company to produce the subpoenaed records and ordering all records of the company impounded by the United States Marshal. Many of the company's records in St. Paul were at once impounded and accountants from the Federal Bureau of Investigation promptly examined them. Among them were records of the company's purchases and sales of slot machines in 1950 and 1951. At the conspiracy trial on April 12, an F. B. I. agent named Peterson testified about those records from summaries he had compiled.\n\nOn April 15, the trial court found it apparent that petitioner's testimony \"was evasive or false, or both,\" and ordered him not to leave its jurisdiction without permission. No further action was taken at that time \"because it was the Court's desire that the jury [in the conspiracy case] should not learn of the affair during the trial, so that the defendants therein would not be prejudiced by it in any way.\"\n\nOn April 22, the jury found Christianson and Paster guilty of the conspiracy charged.\n4\n On the following day, the court directed petitioner to appear on April 27 and show cause why he should not be held in criminal contempt for having obstructed the administration of justice.\n5\n In three specifications, the court charged petitioner with -\n\n \"1. Giving false and evasive testimony under oath on April 1, 1954, upon answering, as vice-president of the Mayflower Distributing Company, subpoenaes duces tecum directed to [it] . . . \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 390]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"2. Disobedience to subpoena duces tecum No. 78, directed to the Mayflower Distributing Company . . . in that the following articles were not produced, as required thereby:\n\n\n  \"(a) Original ledger sheet reflecting the  account of Stanley Baeder, November 1, 1950  through August 30, 1951;\n\n\n  . . . . .\n\n\n \"3. Disobedience to subpoena duces tecum No. 160 directed to the Mayflower Distributing Company, and disobedience to the order of the Court, made on March 29, 1954, directing the Mayflower Distributing Company to produce records forthwith, in the case of United States of America v. Elmo T. Christianson and Herman Paster, Criminal No. 8158, in that the following articles were not produced, as required thereby:\n\n\n  \"(a) General ledger 1950;\n\n\n  \"(b) General ledger 1951;\n\n\n  \"(c) Journal 1950-1951;\n\n\n  \"(d) Check Register 1950-1951; . . . .\" \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 391]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n At 10 a. m., on April 27, petitioner appeared as directed. The court gave his counsel access to the impounded records and postponed the hearing until 3 p.m. At that time, the impounded books and records were present on the trial table and petitioner took the stand in his own defense. He identified items (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the 22 listed in the third specification and introduced those records as his exhibits. Item (a) was the company's general ledger for 1950. It contained a record of sales of new slot machines during October 1950 - January 1951; sales of used slot machines during July 1950 - January 1951; and purchases of used slot machines during August 1950 - January 1951. Petitioner admitted having previously examined the company's 1950 and 1951 general ledgers but said that he had not found evidence of slot machine purchases and sales. He also admitted that he had not examined 19 of the 22 items listed in specification No. 3. At the close of the hearing, over petitioner's objection, a transcript of the testimony of F. B. I. Agent Peterson, given at the conspiracy trial, was admitted in evidence in the contempt proceeding without opportunity for petitioner to confront him or cross-examine him in that proceeding.\n\nAfter finding petitioner guilty of criminal contempt on each of the three specifications, the court gave him a general sentence of imprisonment for a year and a day. On June 3, it released him on bail but denied his motion to suspend his sentence and grant him probation.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, 227 F.2d 74, and denied rehearing, 228 F.2d 134. We granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 1005\n.\n\nAlthough the District Court found petitioner guilty of contempt on each of the three specifications, the Government now concedes that the convictions on the first two are of doubtful validity and does not undertake \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 392]\n\u00a0\n to sustain them. Consequently, we do not consider them here.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThis reduces the case to the charge that petitioner wilfully disobeyed the court's order to produce certain corporate records required by subpoena No. 160. On that issue, it is settled that a criminal contempt is committed by one who, in response to a subpoena calling for corporation or association records, refuses to surrender them when they are in existence and within his control. United States v. Fleischman, \n339 \nU.S. 349\n; United States v. White, \n322 \nU.S. 694\n; Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361\n; and see United States v. Patterson, 219 F.2d 659.\n\nThe Government rests its case on petitioner's failure to produce the records listed in the first four items set forth in specification No. 3, i. e., the general ledger for 1950, the general ledger for 1951, the journal for 1950-1951, and the check register for 1950-1951. These are impounded records which petitioner introduced in evidence as his exhibits.\n7\n The first is the general ledger for 1950, shown by the list of petitioner's exhibits to include records of purchases and sales made during part of the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 393]\n\u00a0\n period called for by subpoena No. 160.\n8\n Petitioner admits having previously examined the first two items.\n\nPetitioner was a \"nominal\" vice-president of the corporation; he rendered it legal and administrative services of many kinds; he was a brother-in-law of its sole owner and president; he appeared in court as its official representative in answer to the subpoenas and represented that he had brought with him all of the subpoenaed records that he and the office force could find.\n\nThe subpoenas had been served on the secretary-treasurer of the corporation, who, in turn, had entrusted to petitioner the duty of satisfying them. When petitioner \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 394]\n\u00a0\n appeared in court in response to the subpoenas, he did not claim either want of actual possession of the required records or lack of opportunity or authority to produce them. See United States v. Bryan, \n339 \nU.S. 323, 333\n; Wilson v. United States, supra, at 376. Yet he failed to produce the vital corporate records which the Government promptly impounded. In our opinion, the evidence reasonably supports the conclusion that those records were in existence and were within petitioner's control. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 395]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner contends that his testimony that he attempted, in good faith, to comply with the subpoenas disproves the existence of any wilful default, and presents an \"adequate excuse\" for his failure to comply under Rule 17 (g), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. However, his protestations of good faith were subject to appraisal by the court that heard them. It was the judge of his credibility and of the weight to be given to his testimony. Lopiparo v. United States, 216 F.2d 87, 91. In our view, the trial court had a sufficient basis for concluding that petitioner intentionally, and without \"adequate excuse,\" defied the court.\n9\n We, therefore, agree that the record sustains petitioner's conviction for criminal contempt under specification No. 3.\n\nPetitioner claims that he was not allowed adequate time to prepare his defense. Under the circumstances of this case and in view of the wide discretion on such matters properly vested in the trial court, we think this claim is unfounded.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner also contends that, as a matter of law, this contempt proceeding should have been heard by a judge other than the one who initiated the proceeding. Rule 42 (b), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, does not require disqualification of the trial judge except where \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 396]\n\u00a0\n \"the contempt charged involves disrespect to or criticism of a judge . . . .\"\n11\n Concededly, the contempt here charged was not of that kind. And while there may be other cases, brought under Rule 42 (b), in which it is the better practice to assign a judge who did not preside over the case in which the alleged contumacy occurred to hear the contempt proceeding, such an assignment is discretionary. In the absence of a showing of an abuse of that discretion, petitioner's conviction on specification No. 3 should be sustained.\n\nThere remains a question as to petitioner's general sentence. It was imposed following his conviction on each of the three original specifications. Although the Government now undertakes to sustain but one of the convictions, it contends that petitioner's sentence should be left as it is because it was within the trial court's allowable discretion. We believe, however, that the court should be given an opportunity to reconsider petitioner's sentence in view of the fact that his conviction now rests solely on the third specification.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nAccordingly, petitioner's conviction for criminal contempt on specification No. 3 is affirmed but his sentence is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court for reconsideration of his sentence.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Subpoena No. 160 commanded the corporation to -\n\n\"Come and bring with you all invoices, bills, checks, slips, papers, records, letters, ledger sheets, bookkeeping records, journals and copies thereof between, by or concerning Mayflower Distributing Company, made, entered, sent or received from July 1, 1950, through April 30, 1951, both dates inclusive, reflecting any and all purchases, sales, trades, exchanges or transfers, both domestic and foreign of any and all slot machines, flat-top or console, coin operated device, whether new or used with any persons, firm or concern.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This was pursuant to Rule 17 (c), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure:\n\n\"Rule 17.

Rev. 860, 864-869 (1950).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Petitioner was an attorney familiar with the case. He appeared in answer to the subpoenas on April 1; after the impounded records were produced, he was, on April 15, warned not to leave the jurisdiction of the court; the order for him to show cause why he should not be held in criminal contempt was issued on April 23, returnable on April 27; and on April 27 his hearing was postponed five hours to give his counsel extra time to examine the impounded records.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See note 5, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Cf. Yasui v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 115, 117\n; Husty v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 694, 703\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, dissenting.\n\nThis conviction for criminal contempt should be reversed and the case should be remanded to the District Court with directions that it be tried before some district judge other than the one who preferred the charges against \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 397]\n\u00a0\n the petitioner and then convicted him. There have probably been few cases in the annals of this Court where the proceedings below were afflicted with so many flagrant errors. The Government has confessed most of these errors, but contends that enough can be salvaged from the record to sustain the conviction.\n\nPetitioner, who is a lawyer, was a vice president of the Mayflower Distributing Company. Apparently he served largely as a nominal officer and performed only minor functions for this company. He was indicted with the president of the company and another man on a charge that they had conspired unlawfully to transport gambling devices in interstate commerce. A jury acquitted petitioner but failed to reach a verdict on the charge against the other two defendants. Subsequently a new trial was ordered for these two defendants. Prior to this new trial, the Government procured the issuance of two very broad subpoenas that directed the Mayflower Distributing Company to produce a large number of its corporate records, which the Government anticipated might show illegal transactions in interstate commerce. These subpoenas were served on the company's secretary but since he was occupied elsewhere he asked the petitioner to produce the material demanded by the subpoenas. On rather short notice petitioner produced a substantial number of records in compliance with these orders.\n\nHowever, the Government, believing that all of the company's records called for by the subpoenas had not been produced, examined petitioner under oath before the trial judge in an effort to determine the extent of his compliance. Petitioner testified that he had produced as many of the records demanded as he could locate by a diligent search; nevertheless the trial judge ordered that all of the company's records be impounded. Government agents took charge of these impounded records and examined them. The Government claims that this \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 398]\n\u00a0\n material included books and documents called for by the subpoenas but not produced by the petitioner.\n\nThe trial judge issued an order under Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for petitioner to show cause why he should not be held in criminal contempt of the court. This charge of contempt was based on three specifications: (1) that petitioner had testified falsely and evasively when asked under oath whether he had produced all the materials called for by the subpoenas; (2) that he had failed to comply with the first subpoena by not producing five items; and (3) that he had disobeyed the second subpoena by failing to produce twenty-two items. Four days after this order was issued, a hearing on the contempt charge was held before the same trial judge who sat in the retrial of the two other defendants and who preferred the charge against the petitioner. The judge found petitioner guilty on all three specifications of contempt and sentenced him to one year and one day imprisonment. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government confesses that the conviction on the first two specifications of contempt cannot be sustained. As it concedes, there was not only insufficient evidence to support the charges made in these specifications but the trial court admitted and relied on evidence which was clearly incompetent. In addition, petitioner was denied his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine witnesses whose testimony was used against him. And in regard to the first specification alleging false and evasive testimony under oath, petitioner's conduct, at most, only involved perjury, a crime that cannot be punished by use of the contempt power.\n2\n Nevertheless, the Government would have us uphold the conviction and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 399]\n\u00a0\n sentence below on the basis of the finding of guilt on the third specification alone, the alleged failure to comply with the second subpoena.\n\nA fundamental premise of our criminal law is that the prosecution has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offense charged. And this Court has repeatedly emphasized that a prosecution for criminal contempt should be treated the same as any other criminal prosecution in this respect.\n3\n Before petitioner could be found guilty of criminal contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena, the prosecution had the burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that he intentionally refused to obey the court's order by not producing the materials demanded even though they were available to him. In this case the record does not contain enough competent evidence for the trier of fact to find that petitioner intentionally refused to comply with the second subpoena or even that the books and documents demanded by that subpoena were available to him.\n\nOnly four of the twenty-two documents referred to in the third specification were introduced in evidence and, as \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 400]\n\u00a0\n the Government recognizes, the conviction must rest on petitioner's intentional refusal to produce these four documents. The only competent evidence in the record which even tends to support an inference that petitioner knew the location of any of these four documents or that they were accessible to him was his comment that he had \"previously\" examined two of them.\n4\n But by itself this solitary ambiguous fragment is clearly insufficient to justify finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the records were available to petitioner at the time when he was supposed to comply with the second subpoena. Since the prosecution offered no admissible evidence at the trial, this obscure remark constitutes the sole case on this point against petitioner. It is the only shred of admissible evidence that the majority has been able to glean from the record. On the other hand, petitioner testified that as far as he knew most of the company's records were stored in the basement of its office and that he had made a diligent search through these records in an effort to produce the material demanded by the subpoena. And he was not the custodian of the company's records, but only a nominal officer.\n\nSimilarly there was almost nothing before the trial court which even suggested that petitioner intentionally refused to produce the records demanded. He stated under oath that he was not trained in accounting and was not familiar with the company's accounting records. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 401]\n\u00a0\n He repeatedly testified that he had attempted in good faith to comply with the subpoena. The Government contends that a prima facie case of intentional refusal can be made out circumstantially from such evidence as is contained in the record. But since the competent evidence does not even support an inference that petitioner knew the location of the four crucial documents or that they were accessible to him, it is hard to see how an intentional refusal to obey can be implied at all, let alone beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe trial judge compounded his error in convicting petitioner on such a striking insufficiency of competent evidence by relying on inadmissible hearsay statements which were not subject to cross-examination. The Government introduced in evidence, over objection, a transcript of an FBI agent's testimony at a prior trial in which petitioner was not a party. The agent had testified that he found certain records and documents in the company's offices. Apparently some of these were papers that the second subpoena had ordered the Mayflower Company to produce. The FBI agent's testimony together with certain statements by petitioner did furnish some evidence that these papers were available to petitioner, but, as the Government confesses, this testimony was plainly inadmissible.\n5\n Nevertheless the record indicates that the trial judge relied on it in finding petitioner guilty. As a matter of fact he went so far as to say \". . . that in this proceeding there ought to be included any pertinent part of the record or the files in the preceding case because this contempt proceeding arose out of the [petitioner's] actions [in refusing to comply with a subpoena issued in the prior case].\"\n\nThe judge's position was manifestly wrong. A trial for criminal contempt is a proceeding wholly separate from \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 402]\n\u00a0\n any prior trial out of which the alleged contempt arose.\n6\n A conviction for contempt in a Rule 42(b) proceeding must stand on the evidence properly introduced in that proceeding. Where a trial judge bases his decision in part on evidence which although material is inadmissible the conviction cannot stand even though an appellate court might conclude after expunging the bad evidence that enough good remained to support the conviction. The defendant is entitled to a decision by the trial judge based on that judge's evaluation of the proper evidence. It is no answer to say that the trial judge could have found the defendant guilty solely on the good evidence. He did not and the defendant is entitled to a retrial. The danger of prejudice from inadmissible hearsay was particularly grave in this case since the admissible evidence before the trial court was so grossly inadequate.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe erroneous admission of portions of the record from the earlier trial accentuated another impropriety in the proceedings below. I believe that it is wrong in a Rule 42 (b) proceeding for the same judge who issued the orders allegedly disobeyed and who preferred the charges of contempt on his own initiative and based on his own knowledge to sit in judgment on the accused. In essence, this allows a man who already believes that another person has disobeyed his command to act as both prosecutor and judge in a proceeding to \"decide\" formally whether that person disobeyed him and should be punished. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 403]\n\u00a0\n It is contrary to elemental principles of justice to place such power in the hands of any man.\n8\n At the very least another judge should be called upon to try the contempt charges. Here, besides issuing the orders allegedly disobeyed and then citing petitioner for contempt, the trial judge was intimately involved in earlier proceedings from which the contempt charge developed and in which evidence relevant to that charge was presented. Under such circumstances he would have been superhuman not to have held preconceived views as to petitioner's guilt.\n\nThe record discloses several incidents which specifically indicate that petitioner was not accorded a fair trial. At the outset, the judge informed the petitioner that the burden was on him to proceed. This is completely inconsistent with the presumption of innocence which exists in favor of a person charged with criminal contempt. Rather, the prosecutor carries the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged contemnor committed the offense charged.\n9\n The almost total absence of any attempt by the Government to introduce evidence at petitioner's trial in support of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 404]\n\u00a0\n the accusations of contempt indicates that it relied on the trial judge's personal knowledge of the case. And as the majority points out several times the trial judge repeatedly indicated prior to the trial that he believed that petitioner was guilty of false and evasive testimony - the offense charged in the first specification of contempt. There is nothing which suggests that he did not have similar preconceived views on the other two specifications.\n10\n Surely every defendant is entitled to an impartial trial by one who has not prejudged his case but instead decides only on the evidence introduced at the trial. Application of this simple principle is just as necessary in contempt cases as in others.\n\nUnder Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure when the alleged contempt involves \"disrespect to or criticism of a judge\" that judge shall be disqualified. Rule 42 (b) contains no provision with respect to disqualification in other circumstances. The majority relies on this silence to reject petitioner's contention that the trial judge here should have stepped aside. But at most Rule 42 (b) only permits a negative inference that a judge who prefers contempt charges for violations of his orders and who is intimately involved in related proceedings bearing on these charges can sit in judgment on the alleged contempt. In any event, Rule 42 (b) is a rule promulgated by this Court and where it is not explicit we should not interpret it in a manner to deny a fair trial before an impartial arbiter. Even if the majority were correct in saying that an \"abuse of discretion\" must be shown before \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 405]\n\u00a0\n this Court will compel a judge to disqualify himself, the record in this case clearly shows that it was an \"abuse of discretion\" for the trial judge not to step aside.\n\nIf the preceding errors and improprieties are not flagrant enough, the Court of Appeals contributed additional error by relying on a so-called \"supplemental record\" to affirm the conviction. This \"supplemental record\" included material which was not introduced at the trial and which was not even made a part of the record on appeal by the trial judge. The Government now concedes that it was improper for the appellate court to rely on this material. But as its first opinion shows, the Court of Appeals referred to the \"supplemental record\" to support its conclusion that there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to find that the papers called for were available to petitioner, that he failed to produce them and that this failure was in bad faith. And on rehearing the Court of Appeals added still further error. After conceding that there were grave doubts about the admissibility of the FBI agent's uncross-examined hearsay statements, it nevertheless stated that the conviction was not reversible because the contempt could have been prosecuted under the summary procedures of Rule 42 (a). But as the Government points out, petitioner could not conceivably have been convicted under that rule.\n\nAnd there are even more matters tainting the proceedings below. For example, petitioner was rushed to trial with an unduly short period to prepare his defense to the contempt charge. He was informed of the specifications of contempt on a Friday and told to appear the next Tuesday for trial. Since the subpoenas were extremely broad and vague and the specifications involved a large number of documents petitioner faced a formidable task in preparing a defense. He had four days, over a weekend, to secure a lawyer and familiarize him with the case, to examine a great volume of records, to talk with those \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 406]\n\u00a0\n having relevant knowledge about these records and to secure witnesses. And when at the trial his lawyer requested a reasonable continuance, the judge gave only a few hours respite.\n\nThis Court should not sanction a conviction where the whole proceedings below were riddled with so many basic errors of serious magnitude. Sending the case back for a new sentence, even if it turns out to be a smaller one, seems to me to fall far short of according this petitioner the kind of justice every defendant has a right to except from our courts. While somehow there is an idea that procedural safeguards required in other criminal trials are not available in trials for criminal contempt, due process certainly requires that one charged with such contempt be given a fair trial before an impartial judge. Here petitioner is to be deprived of his liberty and perhaps his professional career without having received that essential prerequisite to justice.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 227 F.2d 74.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In re Michael, \n326 \nU.S. 224\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] E. g., Michaelson v.

It is not clear what the majority means by this statement. The mere fact that they were before the trial court does not tend to show that their location was known to petitioner or that they were available to him. At most it only shows that they were in existence at the trial and permits an inference that they existed somewhere previously.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In In re Murchison, \n349 \nU.S. 133\n, this Court held that it violated due process for a judge to try contempt charges which he had preferred while acting as a so-called one-man grand jury. The Court, at pp. 136-137, declared:\n\n\"A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process. Fairness of course requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of cases. But our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness. To this end no man can be a judge in his own case and no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome. . . . Fair trials are too important a part of our free society to let prosecuting judges be trial judges of the charges they prefer.\"\n\n\n In the present case we are not compelled to reach the question of due process since this Court possesses general supervisory power over the criminal procedures in lower federal courts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See footnote 3, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] A further indication of the trial judge's attitude toward petitioner is found in the \"supplemental record\" prepared by the Government for the Court of Appeals. The judge is reported as stating at the conclusion of the contempt trial that had petitioner \"been a defendant in the [trial of his two alleged coconspirators] as it was tried [the second time], I don't think he would have been so fortunate.\" The judge then imposed a harsh sentence on petitioner. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 385, 407]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOFFICE EMPLOYES v.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case concerns the attempt of the petitioner, Local 11 of the Office Employes International Union, AFL-CIO, to represent for collective bargaining purposes the office-clerical workers employed at the Teamsters \n\n[353 \nU.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n Building in Portland, Oregon. These office-clerical employees were engaged by the various local unions and affiliates of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, AFL. Local 11 filed a series of unfair labor practice complaints with respondent, National Labor Relations Board, charging in substance that the Teamster group\n1\n had interfered with the Local's effort to organize the office-clerical workers in violation of 8 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act.\n2\n The primary question is whether with respect to their own employees labor organizations are \"employers\" within the meaning of 2 (2) of the Act.\n3\n Since we decide this question in the affirmative a subsidiary question is posed: Whether the Board may, by the application of general standards of classification, refuse to assert any jurisdiction over \n\n[353 \nU.S. 313, 315]\n\u00a0\n labor unions as a class when they act as employers. The Board here refused to assert any jurisdiction, and the complaints were dismissed. 113 N. L. R. B. 987. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 98 U.S. App. D.C. 335, 235 F.2d 832. The importance of the jurisdictional questions involved caused us to grant certiorari in the interest of the proper administration of the Act. \n352 \nU.S. 906\n. We believe the Board erred when it refused to take jurisdiction and thus, in effect, engrafted a blanket exemption upon the Act for all labor unions as employers.\n\nWe shall not deal with the merits of the unfair labor practice complaints. As to the jurisdictional question, the findings indicate that there are 23 workers employed by the various Teamster organizations at the Teamsters Building. They are paid by the Teamster group which, excluding the Security Plan Office, forms \"an integral part of a multistate enterprise.\"\n4\n The trial examiner \n\n[353 \nU.S. 313, 316]\n\u00a0\n concluded that the Teamster group came within the term \"employer\" under 2 (2) of the Act. He further found that their operation was well within the monetary jurisdictional standards set by the Board in Jonesboro Grain Drying Cooperative, 110 N. L. R. B. 481 (1954). While the Board agreed with the examiner's interpretation of 2 (2) as to the term \"employer,\" it held, by a divided vote,\n5\n that since the Teamster group was composed of unions, all engaged in a nonprofit business, the criteria applied to other nonprofit employers should govern. It further concluded \"that labor organizations, which, when engaged in their primary function of advancing employee welfare, are institutions unto themselves within the framework of this country's economic scheme,\" should not \"be made subject to any of the standards originated for business organizations.\" 113 N. L. R. B., at 991.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWith regard to the jurisdiction of the Board the wording of 2 (2) of the Act is clear and unambiguous. It says that the term \"employer\" includes any labor organization \"when acting as an employer.\" It follows that when a labor union takes on the role of an employer the Act applies to its operations just as it would to any other employer. The Board itself recognized this fact as early \n\n[353 \nU.S. 313, 317]\n\u00a0\n as 1951 in Air Line Pilots Association, 97 N. L. R. B. 929. There the Air Line Pilots Association was found to be an employer and the Board ordered that an election be held to determine the wishes of that union's own employees in regard to the selection of appropriate employee bargaining units and a collective bargaining representative. Section 9 of the Act\n6\n was therefore applied to the union as an employer.\n\nThe legislative history of 2 (2) unequivocally supports our conclusion. The Act, before its adoption in 1935, was considered by both the 73d and 74th Congresses.\n7\n On each occasion the bill went into committee with labor unions excluded from the definition of an employer.\n8\n Twice the Senate Committee to which it was referred amended it to include within the category of an employer labor unions when dealing with their own employees. The Committee inserted the words \"other than when acting as an employer\" after the exclusion of labor organizations from the definition of an employer. The Senate Committee on Education and Labor to which the bill was referred stated in explanation of this alteration:\n\n  \"The reason for stating that `employer' excludes  `any labor organization, other than when acting as  an employer' is this: In one sense every labor organization  is an employer, it hires clerks, secretaries, and  the like. In its relations with its own employees,  a labor organization ought to be treated as an  employer, and the bill so provides.\" (Emphasis  added.) S. Rep. No. 1184, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 4. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 313, 318]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The bill which became the Act in 1935, S. 1958, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., contained the identical language set forth in italics in the above Senate Report. It is inescapable that the Board has jurisdiction.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe question remains whether the Board may, nevertheless, refuse to assert jurisdiction over labor unions, as a class, when acting as employers. The Board in the face of the clear expression of the Congress to the contrary has exempted labor unions when acting as employers from the provisions of the Act. We believe that such an arbitrary blanket exclusion of union employers as a class is beyond the power of the Board. While it is true that \"the Board sometimes properly declines to [assert jurisdiction] stating that the policies of the Act would not be effectuated by its assertion of jurisdiction in that case\" (emphasis supplied), Labor Board v. Denver Bldg. Council, \n341 \nU.S. 675, 684\n (1951), here the Board renounces jurisdiction over an entire category of employers, i. e., labor unions, a most important segment of American industrial life. It reasons that labor unions are nonprofit organizations. But until this case the Board has never recognized such a blanket rule of exclusion over all nonprofit employers. It has declined jurisdiction on an ad hoc basis over religious, educational, and eleemosynary employers such as a university library, a symphony orchestra, a research laboratory, and a church radio station.\n9\n When the Act was amended in 1947 the Congress was aware of the Board's general practice of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 313, 319]\n\u00a0\n excluding nonprofit organizations from the coverage of the Act when these organizations were engaged in non-commercial activities.\n10\n The House of Representatives attempted to give these exclusions specific legislative approval.\n11\n However, the Senate draft of the bill excluded only hospital employers from the Act's coverage. The Senate version became a part of the Act and the language is the same as that involved here. The joint committee report on which the final enactment was based recited that the activities of nonprofit employers or their employees had been considered as coming within the Act only \"in exceptional circumstances and in connection with purely commercial activities.\"\n12\n To place labor unions in this category is entirely unrealistic for the very nature of the excluded nonprofit employers is inherently different from that of labor unions and the reason for such exclusion has no applicability to union activity such as that found here. This is particularly true when we consider the pointed language of the Congress - repeated in Taft-Hartley in 1947 - that unions shall not be excluded when acting as employers. As the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals points out, \" 2 (2)'s strikingly particular reference to labor unions sharply differentiates them from non-profit organizations generally . . . .\" 98 U.S. App. D.C., at 337, 235 F.2d, at 834. We do not, therefore, believe that it was within the Board's discretion to remove unions as employers from the coverage of the Act after Congress had specifically included them therein. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 313, 320]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is true that the dollar volume jurisdictional standards adopted by the Board to govern its jurisdiction, Hollow Tree Lumber Co., 91 N. L. R. B. 635 (1950), exclude small employers whose business does not sufficiently affect commerce.\n13\n But its exercise of discretion in the local field does not give the Board the power to decline jurisdiction over all employers in other fields. To do so would but grant to the Board the congressional power of repeal. See also Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board, \n353 \nU.S. 1, 4\n (1957), where the Court refused to pass \"upon the validity of any particular declination of jurisdiction by the Board or any set of jurisdictional standards.\"\n\nWe therefore conclude that the Board's declination of jurisdiction was contrary to the intent of Congress, was arbitrary, and was beyond its power. The judgment is therefore reversed and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for remand to the Board for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The complaints were leveled at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and its representative, Teamster Local No. 206, Teamster Local No. 223, the Teamsters' Joint Council of Drivers No. 37, the Oregon Teamsters' Security Plan Office and its administrator, and the Teamsters Building Association, Inc.

I dissent, however, from the Court's holding that the Board is without power to decline to assert jurisdiction over labor unions as a class. I am of the view that the Board has discretionary authority to decline to do so when the Board determines, for proper reasons, that the policies of the Act would not be effectuated by its assertion of jurisdiction. Cf. Labor Board v. Denver Bldg. Council, \n341 \nU.S. 675, 684\n; Hotel Association of St. Louis, 92 N. L. R. B. 1388, aff'd, 147 F. Supp. 306; Checker Cab Co., 110 N. L. R. B. 683. However, the declination to assert jurisdiction was rested upon the same grounds relied upon by the Board in declining jurisdiction over nonprofit organizations. These grounds, in my view, are not proper reasons for declining to assert jurisdiction over labor organizations. I would, therefore, remand the case to the Court of Appeals for remand to the Board for reconsideration. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 313, 322]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPALERMO v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSection 311 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. 911 (a), gives the Commission power to grant \"temporary authority\" to a common carrier by water or a contract carrier by water to institute service for which \"there is an immediate and urgent need.\" And the section provides that the temporary authority \"shall be valid for such time as the Commission shall specify, but not for more than an aggregate of one hundred and eighty days.\"\n\nSection 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 1008 (b), provides that \"In any case in which the licensee has, in accordance with agency rules, made timely and sufficient application for a renewal or a new license, no license with reference to any activity of a continuing nature shall expire until such application shall have been finally determined by the agency.\"\n\nThe question in the case is whether this provision of the Administrative Procedure Act authorizes the Commission to extend a temporary authority granted under 311 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act for more than 180 days.\n\nOn May 5, 1955, Pan-Atlantic filed with the Commission an application for a permanent certificate of public convenience and necessity as a common carrier by water. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 438]\n\u00a0\n The Commission, upon finding an immediate and urgent need for the service, issued on May 18, 1955, to Pan-Atlantic temporary authority to operate as a common carrier by water between various ports of the United States for a period of 180 days. The Commission did not conclude the proceedings on the application before the expiration of the 180-day period. Accordingly, prior to the expiration of the 180-day period and on application by Pan-Atlantic, it authorized Pan-Atlantic to continue to perform the water carrier service authorized by the temporary authority until further order of the Commission, but not beyond the time the application for a permanent certificate had been finally determined. The appellees, who are seven railroads, opposed this extension before the Commission and then instituted this suit in the District Court to vacate the Commission's order which authorized the continuance of the temporary authority beyond the 180-day period.\n\nThe District Court held for the appellees, 144 F. Supp. 53, feeling bound by the prior decision of that court in Stone's Express, Inc. v. United States, 122 F. Supp. 955,\n1\n though two of the three judges indicated that were stare decisis not to control, they would sustain the Commission. 144 F. Supp., at 54. The case is here by appeal. 28 U.S.C. 1253. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n352 \nU.S. 914\n.\n\nWe sustain the Commission in its assertion of authority to extend this temporary authority beyond 180 days.\n\n\"License\" as used in the Administrative Procedure Act includes \"the whole or part of any agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, membership, statutory exemption or other form of permission.\" 2 (e). A temporary authority granted under 311 (a) of the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 439]\n\u00a0\n Interstate Commerce Act would seem to be a \"permit\" or \"certificate\" under the Administrative Procedure Act. \"Licensee,\" as used in the sentence of 9 (b) which we have quoted, would seem, therefore, to include one who holds a temporary permit under 311 (a). It is argued that \"license\" in that section includes only those that are permanent. But we see no justification for that narrow reading. A permit for 180 days covers an \"activity of a continuing nature.\"\n\n\n Section 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act is a direction to the various agencies. By its terms there must be a license outstanding; it must cover activities of a continuing nature; there must have been filed a timely and sufficient application to continue the existing operation; and the application for the new or extended license must not have been finally determined.\n\nEach of these conditions is satisfied in the present case; and we see no reason why the provisions of this later Act may not be invoked to protect a person with a license from the damage he would suffer by being compelled to discontinue a business of a continuing nature, only to start it anew after the administrative hearing is concluded. That has been the Commission's consistent construction of the law;\n2\n and we think it is the correct one. Section 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act contains a new rule that supplements the prior authority granted by 311 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act. Initially, the Commission can do no more than issue a temporary authority good for 180 days. But once the conditions of 9 (b) are satisfied, an extension in the interests of economy and efficiency is authorized.\n\nThe Commission advises us that the combined time required for the administrative proceedings on an application \n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 440]\n\u00a0\n for a certificate and for judicial review almost inevitably exceeds 180 days. Courts have no authority to issue these permits. See United States v. Carolina Carriers Corp., \n315 \nU.S. 475, 489\n-490. Unless the authority is vested in the Commission by 9 (b), the operation, no matter how essential or necessary, must be discontinued at the end of 180 days. We think such a reading of the law would mutilate the administrative system which Congress created by the two Acts. Where the remedy for an evil is clear, the remedial provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act should be given full effect. See Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, \n339 \nU.S. 33, 41\n. We conclude that an harmonious reading of 311 (a) and 9 (b) requires the latter to be read as supplementing the former and to be construed as applying to temporary as well as to permanent licenses.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That case became moot after probable jurisdiction had been noted by this Court. See \n350 \nU.S. 906\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See 13 Fed. Reg. 4150 for the rules of the Commission governing these extensions.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nA major purpose of the Interstate Commerce Act is to prevent evils deemed to result from ease of entry and overcompetition in the transportation industry. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 298, 312\n-313. Accordingly, the Act prohibits new carrier operations except after notice to affected parties, an evidentiary hearing, administrative findings as to the public convenience and necessity of the proposed service, and court review of the administrative determination. See 49 U.S.C. 306-308, 309. Sections 210a (a)\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 441]\n\u00a0\n (applying to motor carriers), and 311 (a)\n2\n (applying to water carriers) of the Act are narrow exceptions to this fundamental policy. They permit the Interstate Commerce Commission, \"in its discretion and without hearings or other proceedings,\" to grant temporary authority for carrier service for which there is \"an immediate and urgent need\" and within territory having no carrier service \"capable of meeting such need.\" Any grant of temporary authority is expressly made subject to an unconditional maximum time limit of 180 days.\n\n\"Such temporary authority shall be valid for such time as the Commission shall specify, but for not more than an aggregate of one hundred and eighty days, and shall create no presumption that corresponding permanent authority will be granted thereafter.\" 49 U.S.C. 911 (a). See also, 310a (a).\n\n\n Congress was concerned with situations in which temporary authority might be needed on an emergency basis to meet specific transportation problems. However, it plainly was aware that the over-all purpose of the Act would be jeopardized unless the Commission's power to authorize temporary carrier operations was severely limited. The intent of Congress was unmistakable. In recommending the enactment of 210a (a), the Interstate Commerce Commission itself said:\n\n \"Cases arise, and have been brought to our attention, where urgent need for interstate motor carrier service suddenly develops. The bringing in of oil wells in a new field and conditions created by a flood or other calamitous visitation are good examples, and there are others. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 442]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"We believe that the Commission should have power to meet such emergencies by a grant of temporary operating authority, in its discretion and without hearings or other proceedings. It is recognized that care would be necessary to protect the legitimate interests of other carriers . . . . [T]he authority granted would be strictly limited in time by the terms of the proposed amendment.\" (Emphasis supplied.) S. Doc. No. 154, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 2-3.\n\n\n Congress realized that in many of the situations qualifying for temporary authority under 210a (a) and 311 (a) permanent authority might later be required. The \"bringing in of oil wells in a new field,\" as well as other situations, might require the granting of permanent authority following the hearing required by the Act. In such situations, 210a (a) and 311 (a) operated as an incentive to the Commission to reach its final decision with respect to the granting of permanent authority within 180 days.\n\nThus, two policies underlie 210a (a) and 311 (a): (1) providing the Commission with discretionary power to handle emergency situations by granting a severely limited temporary authority; and (2) prodding the Commission to finish, within 180 days, its determination with respect to the granting of permanent authority for this service. The Court, by now holding that 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 242-243, 5 U.S.C. 1008, authorizes the Commission to extend a temporary authority for more than 180 days, eliminates the second policy and makes the 180-day limitation meaningless. I do not believe that Congress intended 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act to accomplish this result.\n\nThe Administrative Procedure Act, enacted in 1946, was designed to promote general fairness and regularity \n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 443]\n\u00a0\n in administrative action. Section 9 (b) partakes of this purpose by requiring administrative agencies to act on license applications with reasonable dispatch and \"with due regard to the rights or privileges of all the interested parties or adversely affected persons.\" It also protects persons who have received licenses from their summary revocation, and from the hardships occasioned by expiration of a license before the licensing agency has been able to pass upon its renewal.\n3\n It makes no reference to emergency permits restricted to a specific number of days.\n\nThe third sentence of 9 (b) merely provides that if a licensee has made timely application for \"a renewal or a new license, no license with reference to any activity of a continuing nature\" shall expire prior to final administrative \n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 444]\n\u00a0\n action on such application. The word \"renewal\" obviously relates to the license already held and is inapplicable here. The legislative history indicates that the other words which might apply, \"new license,\" refer to a new license of the same type or class as that already held.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIn this case, the expiration of appellant Pan-Atlantic's 180-day temporary authority, issued to cover an emergency situation while its application for permanent authority is pending, does not come within the terms of 9 (b) since the permanent license sought is not of the same type and class as the old license. The Court's contrary conclusion can be reached only by reading the word \"license\" as used in the third sentence of 9 (b) in two different senses - first, as referring to a temporary license, and, second, as referring to a permanent license. The improbability of this interpretation is emphasized by policy considerations stemming from both the Administrative Procedure Act and the Interstate Commerce Act.\n\nThe policy behind the third sentence of 9 (b) is that of protecting those persons who already have regularly issued licenses from the serious hardships occasioned both \n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 445]\n\u00a0\n to them and to the public by expiration of a license before the agency finds time to pass upon its renewal. As the initial license was obtained after a hearing at which all interested parties had an opportunity to be heard, 9 (b) operates to protect valuable existing rights and avoids unnecessary injury resulting from administrative delay. So applied, it does not prejudice the rights of others since they had a chance to be heard on the initial application, and can be heard on the renewal. However, the issuance of temporary authority to Pan-Atlantic in the instant case was done ex parte in order to meet an alleged emergency need. Affected parties had no opportunity to contest it. Moreover, Pan-Atlantic knew that the license was issued for a maximum period of 180 days and must have accepted it on that basis. To convert such temporary and limited rights into rights continuing until the Commission, without any time limit on doing so, finally acts on Pan-Atlantic's application for permanent authority deprives licensed competitors and other affected parties of their rights under the Interstate Commerce Act, without any hearing on the issues involved.\n\nTemporary authorities are issued ex parte and without regard to their competitive effects. Yet, if permitted to be outstanding for prolonged periods, they may produce competitive changes comparable to those produced by a grant of permanent authority. In this case, as in a high proportion of the instances in which the Commission has extended a temporary authority beyond 180 days, Pan-Atlantic's \"temporary\" service already has been in effect for more than two years.\n\nThe Interstate Commerce Act, for tested reasons of public policy, prohibits new carrier operations unless the applicant obtains a certificate of public convenience and necessity in a proceeding in which those adversely affected have an opportunity to be heard in opposition. Grants of temporary operating authority for the maximum period \n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 446]\n\u00a0\n of 180 days constitute a narrow exception to these requirements. Section 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act should not be interpreted as wiping out this time limitation when the result conflicts with a fundamental objective of the National Transportation Policy.\n\nThere is a further incongruity if 9 (b) is interpreted to apply to temporary operating authorities issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Section 9 (b) provides that \"no license . . . shall expire until such application shall have been finally determined by the agency.\" (Emphasis supplied.) This language is mandatory. Although 210a and 311 of the Interstate Commerce Act place the initial granting of temporary authority entirely in the Commission's discretion, the Commission would be compelled by 9 (b) to extend the temporary authority in every case involving activity of a continuing nature until it formally completes the proceeding on the application for permanent authority. The result is to require the Commission to extend the temporary authority even though, in a particular case, it might be convinced that the temporary emergency service was no longer necessary.\n\nEven if 9 (b) is interpreted as extending temporary licenses during the pendency of permanent license proceedings, it should not be applied to the temporary authorities issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission under 210a and 311 of the Interstate Commerce Act. Those sections are special statutes dealing in precise terms with a specific subject.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 447]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn response to the claim that the Commission's construction of 9 (b) should be given considerable weight, it must be noted that its interpretation was adopted largely as a matter of expediency rather than as a reasoned interpretation.\n6\n Cf. Skidmore v. Swift & Co., \n323 \nU.S. 134, 140\n. In any event, it is the duty of the Court to determine whether, as a matter of law, the general provisions of 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act override the express limitations placed by Congress upon the Commission by earlier provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nFor these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 52 Stat. 1238, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 310a (a).

Except in cases of willfulness or those in which public health, interest, or safety requires otherwise, no withdrawal, suspension, revocation, or annulment of any license shall be lawful unless, prior to the institution of agency proceedings therefor, facts or conduct which may warrant such action shall have been called to the attention of the licensee by the agency in writing and the licensee shall have been accorded opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all lawful requirements. In any case in which the licensee has, in accordance with agency rules, made timely and sufficient application for a renewal or a new license, no license with reference to any activity of a continuing nature shall expire until such application shall have been finally determined by the agency.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The third sentence of 9 (b) was taken from a similar provision \"contained in the licensing procedure act of the State of Ohio (Act of June 3, 1943, sec. 1 amending secs. 154-167 of the General Code; Amended substitute Senate bill No. 36).\" Legislative History, Administrative Procedure Act, S.

Some of the Commission's lawyers are of the opinion that an extension is authorized by Section 210a (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act; others are of the opinion that continuances of such operations are authorized by Section 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act; while others doubt that either Section 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act or Section 210a (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act or any other provision, either extends or authorizes the Commission to extend, these temporary authorities where they have been in effect for 180 days . . . .\" CCH Fed. Carriers Reporter \u00a7 23,040. In addition, the Commission has requested Congress to enact amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act which would be unnecessary if 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act meant what the Commission says it does. I. C. C., 61st Ann. Rep. (1947), 148; I. C. C., 69th Ann. Rep. (1955), 132.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Nor can the solution be found in the fact that the Commission has extended about 19% of all temporary authorizations beyond 180 days. If in fact there exists \"an immediate and urgent need\" for service which no other carrier is capable of providing, 180 days is a sufficient time for final administrative determination of the question whether the service is required by public convenience and necessity. And even if it were not, the remedy would be legislative amendment of the Interstate Commerce Act, not administrative or judicial revision. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 436, 448]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEAK v. UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 491\nArgued: February 28, 1957Decided: March 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner brought suit in a Federal District Court in 1954 to recover the proceeds of a National Service Life Insurance policy on an insured who had been missing since his disappearance from the Army in 1943. The complaint alleged that, prior to the insured's disappearance, he was in frail health and had become totally and permanently disabled. The complaint alleged further that the insured had died in 1943, and that his total and permanent disability during the time the policy was in force entitled him to waiver of premiums on the policy. Held: Upon the allegations of the complaint, petitioner was entitled to take the case to a jury. Pp. 44-47.\n\n (a) Where proof of an insured's death must rest primarily upon his unexplained absence, suit may not be maintained, as a practical matter, prior to the expiration of the statutory 7-year period; and it is from that date that the 6-year statute of limitations should be computed. P. 45.\n\n\n (b) The provision of 38 U.S.C. 810 that the death of the insured \"as of the date of the expiration of such period . . . may . . . be considered as sufficiently proved\" does not preclude the beneficiary from introducing further evidence from which the jury might conclude that the insured's presumed death occurred at an earlier date when the policy was still in force. Pp. 45-46.\n\n\n (c) It is only where the beneficiary proves merely the fact of the insured's 7 years' unexplained absence that the statute establishes the presumption of death as of the end of that period. P. 46.\n\n\n (d) The \"contingency on which the claim is founded,\" as used in 38 U.S.C. 445, means the end of the 7-year period when the presumption of death arose. P. 46.\n\n\n (e) Since the claim was filed by petitioner within one year subsequent to the presumed date of death, it should be considered as including the lesser claim of premium waiver under 38 U.S.C. 802 (n). Pp. 46-47. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 44]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (f) The alternative cause of action, based on allegations of permanent and total disability of the insured at the time of his disappearance, would not have accrued until 1950, so the 6-year statute of limitations had not run when this suit was brought. Pp. 46-47.\n\n\n 229 F.2d 503, reversed and remanded.\n\nJohn S. Wrinkle argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nGeorge S. Leonard argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Doub, Samuel D. Slade and Alan S. Rosenthal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner instituted this suit in the District Court in 1954 to recover the proceeds of a National Service Life Insurance policy. Petitioner's son, the insured, has been missing since disappearing from his army unit in 1943. The complaint alleges that, prior to the insured's disappearance, his condition was one of \"general debility and weakness and despondency,\" and that he had become totally and permanently disabled as a result of certain \"diseases, ailments and injuries.\" The complaint further avers that the insured had died in 1943, and that his total and permanent disability during the time the policy was in force entitled him to waiver of premiums on the policy.\n\nThe District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that the insured would, under the allegations of the complaint, be presumed to be dead as of 1950, and that the policy had lapsed in the interim. 138 F. Supp. 810. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 229 F.2d 503. It held that the complaint contained no allegations which would entitle the trier of fact to conclude that the insured had died \n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 45]\n\u00a0\n at a time when the policy continued in force. Id., at 504. We granted certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 822\n.\n\nRespondent urges that the insured's death must be presumed to have occurred in 1950, at the end of seven years' unexplained absence, when this policy had long lapsed for failure to pay premiums. In the alternative, it is argued that, if the petitioner's claim is founded on the insured's death in 1943, it is barred by the six-year statute of limitations, 38 U.S.C. 445. We hold that, under the allegations in this complaint, petitioner is entitled to take her case to a jury.\n\nCongress has provided in 38 U.S.C. 810 that a presumption of death shall arise upon the continued and unexplained absence of the insured for a period of seven years. Where proof of the insured's death must rest primarily upon his unexplained absence, suit may not be maintained, as a practical matter, prior to the expiration of the statutory seven-year period. Petitioner's cause of action, therefore, \"accrued\" at the time when, under 810, she might have successfully maintained her suit, and that is the date from which the six-year statute of limitations should be computed.\n\nMoreover, nothing in the provision of 810 that the death of the insured \"as of the date of the expiration of such period . . . may . . . be considered as sufficiently proved\" precludes the beneficiary from introducing further evidence from which the jury might conclude that the insured's presumed death occurred at an earlier date when the policy was still in force. United States v. Willhite, 219 F.2d 343.\n*\n The jury might so conclude here, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 46]\n\u00a0\n if petitioner can prove the allegations of the complaint concerning the insured's frail health and disability or other relevant facts. The presumption leaves it open to prove the precise time of the death, as the statute does not purport to create a conclusive presumption that the insured died at the end of the seven-year period. To compute the six-year limitation period from the date which the trier of fact establishes as the date of death would be to say that the beneficiary's right to recover had expired before she could have successfully prosecuted a lawsuit to enforce that right. It is only where the beneficiary proves merely the fact of the insured's seven years' unexplained absence that the statute establishes the presumption of death as of the end of that period. The \"contingency on which the claim is founded,\" as used in 38 U.S.C. 445, must, therefore, mean the end of the seven-year period when the presumption of death arose.\n\nThat seems to us to be the common sense of the mater; and common sense often makes good law.\n\nFurthermore the allegations of permanent and total disability at the time of disappearance of the insured, if proved, would bring the petitioner within the premium waiver provisions of 38 U.S.C. 802 (n). Since the claim was filed by petitioner within one year subsequent to the presumed date of death, it should be considered as including the lesser claim of premium waiver. Hence, even though the jury found the actual date of death to be later than 1943, the coverage of the policy might continue. As we read the complaint, this alternative cause of action would also not have accrued until 1950; and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 47]\n\u00a0\n the six-year statute of limitations had not run when this suit was brought.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for trial.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] That was the view even before the presumption of death at the end of seven years' absence was codified. In Davie v. Briggs, \n97 \nU.S. 628, 634\n, the Court said, \"If it appears in evidence that the absent person, within the seven years, encountered some specific peril, or within that period came within the range of some impending \n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 46]\n\u00a0\n or immediate danger, which might reasonably be expected to destroy life, the court or jury may infer that life ceased before the expiration of the seven years.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nPetitioner sues to recover death benefits under a National Service Life Insurance Policy on the life of her son, a draftee in the United States Army. The case is before us only on the complaint, whose substantial allegations are these: The insured disappeared from his post in the Army on or about July 30, 1943, and has not been heard of since. At the time of his disappearance, for some time before, and continuously thereafter until his death, the insured suffered from \"cholera, nervous trouble, mental trouble, St. Vitus Dance, generally debility and weakness and despondency,\" which prevented him from pursuing any gainful occupation and entitled him to a waiver of premiums on the policy, and \"to have said policy continue in full force and effect until his death.\" It is then alleged that by reason of the insured's disappearance and ailments \"the law presumes and [petitioner] avers that he died on or about July 30, 1943, and while the policy was in full force and effect and . . . that on or about July 30, 1950, at the expiration of said seven years\" petitioner became entitled to the policy proceeds. Petitioner finally alleges that she made \"due application\" to the Veterans Administration for the policy \n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 48]\n\u00a0\n proceeds and \"to have said insurance contract construed as being in full force and effect at the time of assured's death,\" but that her application was refused by the Administration on July 18, 1951.\n\nActions on life insurance policies issued under the National Service Life Insurance Act are governed by a six-year statute of limitations.\n1\n Section 610 of the Act, 38 U.S.C. 810, abolishes all state law presumptions of death in connection with these policies, and substitutes a statutory presumption of death at the expiration of seven years' unexplained absence.\n2\n And 602 (n) of the Act, 38 U.S.C. 802 (n), provides for waiver of premiums under certain conditions, upon application of the beneficiary within one year after the insured's death.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 49]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the complaint for insufficiency and also held the action barred by limitations.\n4\n This Court holds the complaint sufficient and the action not barred.\n\nIf petitioner can prove that the policy was still in force in 1950, the date when death is presumed under 38 U.S.C. 810, her suit is clearly timely and she is entitled to recover. I agree with the Court that, liberally read, the complaint states facts which should allow her so to prove.\n\nAssuming, however, that the policy was no longer in force in 1950, I think the suit is barred by limitations, and I must dissent from this aspect of the Court's holding. The insured disappeared in 1943. Petitioner alleges that death occurred in 1943, as indeed she must, since we now assume that the policy expired soon thereafter. But if death occurred in 1943, the cause of action accrued at that time, and is therefore barred after six years; and suit was not brought until 1954. Yet petitioner asks us to hold that for the purposes of the statute of limitations we use the presumption of 810, that death occurs at the expiration of a continued seven-year period of absence, in order to postpone the accrual of a cause of action necessarily founded on a death allegedly occurring at the beginning of the seven years. I do not understand how we can accept any such theory. Congress has provided that the suit must be brought within six years after the cause of action accrued, and that the cause accrues on the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 50]\n\u00a0\n \"happening of the contingency on which the claim is founded.\"\n5\n The contingency which here starts the running of the statute is clearly the death of the insured. United States v. Towery, \n306 \nU.S. 324\n. If the insured died in 1943, as the petitioner avers, she should have brought suit within six years thereafter, before 1949. For petitioner is relying on actual death, not the presumed death provided for by Congress in cases of disappearances. She cannot rely on the latter, for Congress has unequivocally stated that the presumption created by seven years' unexplained absence is that the insured died at the end of that period, and the policy was then, by hypothesis, no longer in effect.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe dilemma petitioner faces is clearly self-inflicted. Congress has provided a fair choice. If petitioner can prove death in 1943, as she must if the policy expired then, she has six years within which to bring suit to prove it. If, on the other hand, petitioner has no proof of actual death at all, she must merely keep the policy alive by payment of premiums or application for waiver until the end of seven years, and she then has six more years in which to sue on the basis of presumed death at the end of the seven-year period.\n\nThe Court says that \"to compute the six-year limitation period from the date which the trier of fact establishes as the date of death would be to say that the beneficiary's right to recover had expired before she could have successfully prosecuted a lawsuit to enforce that right.\" I understand neither the logic nor the policy of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 51]\n\u00a0\n this argument. Surely in every lawsuit on a life insurance policy the statute of limitations runs from the date of death and yet the date of death is something to be proved in the lawsuit itself. In fact I can think of no litigation in which the statute of limitations does not run from the time the cause of action accrues and the plaintiff need not prove at trial both that there is a cause of action and that it accrued within the period of limitations. Why is it unfair to say to a plaintiff who must prove a 1943 death that she must prove it within six years thereafter? Not only is it unlikely that plaintiff will be in a better position to prove a 1943 death in 1954 than she was in 1949, but the whole essence of the policy behind statutes of limitations runs counter to any such assumption.\n\nIt is argued that such a result would be harsh, in that a beneficiary should be left free to prove in the same action either actual or presumed death, and that proof of actual death may not turn up until after six years have passed; yet a beneficiary must wait seven before suing on the basis of presumed death.\n7\n But this is only another way of urging that the statute of limitations be waived every time a plaintiff has difficulty in collecting proof during the period given by the statute. And it has been the consistent opinion of this Court that limitations, particularly against the United States, may not be tolled, without statutory authorization, merely because a plaintiff might not be in a position to carry the burden of proof within the statutory period. McIver v. Ragan, 2 Wheat. 25; McMahon v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 25\n; Pillsbury v. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 52]\n\u00a0\n United Engineering Co., \n342 \nU.S. 197\n; Unexcelled Chemical Corp. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 59\n.\n\nImportant considerations of policy buttress that opinion. Hereafter in every case of disappearance a beneficiary may, without keeping the policy alive, wait thirteen years before suing on the policy, and may allege and prove that death occurred thirteen years theretofore. Surely in the intervening years there will have been loss of evidence due to the death of some witnesses, clouding in the recollection of others, and loss of records. In fact in this very case the Government is now put to the task of meeting numerous allegations with respect to the insured's physical and mental condition, the circumstances of his disappearance, all in 1943, and his likely movements after disappearance. The whole purpose of the statute of limitations, it seems to me, is to save litigants the burdensome effort of having to collect and meet such stale evidence. The Court overrides that policy today in order to give one plaintiff, whose case has human appeal, a chance to recover. Thus is bad law made.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 38 U.S.C. 445, so far as pertinent here, provides: \"No suit . . . on United States Government life (converted) insurance shall be allowed under this section unless the same shall have been brought within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made: Provided, That for the purposes of this section it shall be deemed that the right accrued on the happening of the contingency on which the claim is founded . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"No State law providing for presumption of death shall be applicable to claims for National Service Life Insurance.

I think it untenable to suggest that such a complaint would be demurrable as prematurely brought. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 43, 53]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA R.

RYCHLIK(1957)\nNo. 56\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Under 2, Eleventh (a) and (c) of the Railway Labor Act, petitioners, a railroad and a union, entered into a union-shop contract requiring trainmen employed by the railroad to become and remain members of the petitioner union or another union \"national in scope\" and \"organized in accordance with\" the Act. A trainman employed by the railroad was a member of the petitioner union; but he resigned from that union and joined a competing union which he believed to be \"national in scope\" and \"organized in accordance with\" the Act, but which had never qualified under 3, First, as one of the unions eligible to elect the labor members of the National Railroad Adjustment Board. After hearings, a System Board of Adjustment established under 3, Second, determined that the trainman's new union did not satisfy the union-shop provision of the contract, and the railroad discharged him. He sued for an injunction compelling petitioner union to accept him as a member and the railroad to accept him as an employee. Held: Section 2, Eleventh (c) makes available for alternative membership under such a contract only such unions as have already qualified as electors under 3, First; and the trainman did not state a claim on which relief can be granted. Pp. 481-497.\n\n (a) The purpose of 2, Eleventh (c) was to prevent compulsory dual unionism or the necessity of changing from one union to another when an employee temporarily changes crafts.

Mulholland, Edward J. Hickey, Jr. and Richard R. Lyman for the Railway Labor Executives' Association, and Clarence E. Weisell and Harold N. McLaughlin for the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen is the collective bargaining representative for trainmen employed by the petitioner Railroad. In accordance with Section 2, Eleventh (a) and (c) of the Railway Labor Act,\n1\n the Brotherhood and the Railroad negotiated a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 482]\n\u00a0\n union-shop contract in 1952, which required trainmen employed by the Railroad to become members of and retain membership in the Brotherhood or in another labor organization \"national in scope\" and \"organized in accordance with\" the Railway Labor Act. Respondent Rychlik was employed as a trainman by the Railroad and was a member in good standing of the Brotherhood until February 1953. At that time he resigned from the Brotherhood and joined the United Railroad Operating Crafts (UROC), a competing union which respondent believed in good faith to be \"national in scope\" and \"organized in accordance with\" the Act, and therefore available for alternative membership under Section 2, Eleventh and the union-shop provision of the contract, even though UROC had never qualified itself under Section 3, First of the Act as one of the unions \"national in scope\" eligible to elect the labor members of the National Railroad Adjustment Board.\n2\n On July 31, 1954, Rychlik, continuing his membership in UROC, also joined the Switchmen's Union of North America, concededly a union \"national in scope\" within the meaning of the statute and the contract.\n\nFollowing his resignation from the Brotherhood, Rychlik was charged with violation of the union-shop agreement. He received two hearings before a \"System Board of Adjustment,\" a body established under the agreement, pursuant to Section 3, Second of the Act,\n3\n to settle contract disputes, and composed of two representatives \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 483]\n\u00a0\n each from the Railroad and the Brotherhood.\n4\n This Board determined that membership in UROC did not satisfy the union-shop provision of the contract, which mirrored the requirements of the Act, and that therefore Rychlik had failed to maintain continuous union membership in accordance with the contract, not having joined the Switchmen's Union until some 16 months after resigning from the Brotherhood. Accordingly, Rychlik was discharged by the Railroad.\n\nRychlik, on behalf of himself and other employees of the Railroad similarly situated, thereupon brought this class suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, seeking an injunction compelling petitioners to accept him as a member of the Brotherhood and an employee of the Railroad. He alleged that his discharge violated Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act, and that the System Board's determination to the contrary could not be final and binding, since the presence on the Board of two representatives of the Brotherhood created an inherent and fatal bias which vitiated the proceeding. The District Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a cause of action.\n5\n The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 484]\n\u00a0\n reversed and remanded for review on the merits of the System Board's decision that membership in UROC did not satisfy the Act.\n6\n Accepting the premise that Section 2, Eleventh (c) conferred on respondent a right to belong to any union which is, in fact, \"national in scope\" and organized in accordance with the Railway Labor Act, even though it has not qualified under Section 3, First of the Act as an elector of labor representatives on the National Railroad Adjustment Board,\n7\n the court held (1) that, although the System Board had jurisdiction over this dispute between Rychlik and the Brotherhood,\n8\n its decision that UROC was not a union \"national in scope\" was subject to full review on the merits, because of the bias which must be attributed to a body half of whose members represented the Brotherhood, a party in interest; and (2) that this bias was not cured by the availability of the alternative procedure provided by Section 3, First of the Act, whereby it can be established that a union is \"national in scope\" and organized in accordance with the Act.\n9\n Because of a conflict between \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 485]\n\u00a0\n the decision of the court below and an earlier decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,\n10\n and the importance of these questions in the administration of the Railway Labor Act, we granted certiorari. \n351 \nU.S. 930\n.\n\nOn our view of the case we do not reach either question decided by the Court of Appeals, for we disagree with its premise as to the meaning of Section 2, Eleventh (c). For reasons hereafter given, we hold that Section 2, Eleventh (c) allows alternative union membership only in those unions which have already qualified under Section 3, First of the Act, as electors of the union representatives on the National Railroad Adjustment Board, and not membership in any union which happens to be, as a matter of fact, national in scope and organized in accordance with the Railway Labor Act. Since UROC was not so qualified, respondent had no federal right to join it in lieu of the authorized bargaining representative under the union-shop provision of the Railroad-Brotherhood contract. His discharge by petitioners therefore did not give rise to a federal cause of action.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nIn order to clarify the reasons for these conclusions, a brief outline of the relevant provisions of the Railway Labor Act is necessary. Section 2, Eleventh (a) of that Act authorizes railroads and labor unions to establish a union shop, that is, an agreement requiring as a condition of continued employment that employees join the union designated as their authorized bargaining representative.\n12\n Section 2, Eleventh (c) then provides that in the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 486]\n\u00a0\n case of operating employees the union-shop provision of a contract will be satisfied if an employee is a member of \"any one of the labor organizations, national in scope, organized in accordance with this Act and admitting to membership employees of a craft or class in any of said services . . . .\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 487]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 3, First establishes the National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB), an agency designed to settle disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements. Subsection (a) provides that this Board shall consist of 36 members, 18 selected by the carriers, and 18 \"by such labor organizations of the employees, national in scope, as have been or may be organized in accordance with the provisions of section 2 . . . .\"\n14\n Subsection (f) then states that if a dispute arises as to the right of a union to participate in the election of the labor representatives on the NRAB, the Secretary of Labor will notify the Mediation Board if he feels the claim has merit.\n15\n The Mediation Board then constitutes a \"board of three,\" consisting of one representative of the claimant union, one representative of the unions already entitled to elect the labor members of the NRAB, and one neutral member selected by the Mediation Board. This board of three then decides whether the claimant union is entitled to be an elector for the NRAB, that is, whether it is \"organized in accordance with section 2 . . . and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 488]\n\u00a0\n is otherwise properly qualified to participate in the selection . . . .\"\n16\n\u00a0\n\nAt first glance the language of Section 2, Eleventh (c) would appear to be disarmingly clear: union-shop contracts are satisfied if the employee belongs to any union which happens to be national in scope and organized in accordance with the Act. And if that be its meaning we would then have to deal with the questions reached by the Court of Appeals. However, as so often happens, when the language of the statute is read, not in a vacuum, but in the light of the policies this Section was intended to serve,\n17\n it becomes clear that the purpose of Congress was not, as respondent contends, to give employees in the railroad industry any blanket right to join unions other than the authorized bargaining representative, or to help \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 489]\n\u00a0\n dissident or rising new unions recruit new members. Rather, the sole aim of the provision was to protect employees from the requirement of dual unionism in an industry with high job mobility, and thus to confer on qualified craft unions the right to assure members employment security, even if a member should be working temporarily in a craft for which another union is the bargaining representative. And this right is given only to those unions which have already qualified as being \"national in scope\" and \"organized in accordance with\" the Act for the purpose of electing the union members of the NRAB under Section 3.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe purposes to be served by Section 2 are clearly revealed by its history. Until 1951 the Railway Labor Act did not permit union-shop contracts in the industry.\n18\n In that year the Congress, persuaded by the established unions that it is unfair to allow nonunion employees to enjoy benefits obtained by the union's efforts in collective bargaining without paying any of the costs, passed Section 2, Eleventh of the Act, which authorized the union shop.\n19\n However, the hearings on the bill\n20\n revealed a problem, peculiar to the railroad industry, in establishing the union \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 490]\n\u00a0\n shop. Labor in this industry is organized largely on craft rather than industrial lines. Engineers, firemen, trainmen, switchmen, brakemen, and conductors, for example, each are separately organized for the purposes of bargaining. And normally different unions represent different crafts; thus, on the same railroad, firemen might be represented by the Brotherhood of Firemen and Enginemen, and engineers by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. Yet seasonal and other factors produce a high degree of job mobility for individual employees in the industry, that is, of shuttling back and forth between crafts. For example, a fireman may be temporarily promoted to engineer for a short time, or a conductor might have to serve temporarily as brakeman. Under the ordinary union-shop contract, such a change from craft to craft, even though temporary, would mean that the employee would either have to belong to two unions - one representing each of his crafts - or would have to shuttle between unions as he shuttles between jobs. The former alternative would, of course, be expensive and sometimes impossible, while the latter would be complicated and might mean loss of seniority and union benefits.\n21\n\u00a0\n\nSo Congress faced the problem of reconciling the union shop with some protection to employees who shifted from one craft to another one represented by a different labor organization under a union-shop contract.\n22\n The solution, of course, was evident: to provide that if a fireman, for example, is temporarily promoted to engineer, he can satisfy the union-shop contract of the engineers although still remaining a member of the union representing the firemen. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 491]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a result, the Committee reporting the bill to the Senate offered on the Senate floor the following amendment to subsection (a) of Section 2, Eleventh:\n\n\"Provided further, That no such [union shop] agreement shall require membership in more than one labor organization.\"\n23\n\u00a0\n\n\n Senator Hill, manager of the bill, explained the Committee amendment:\n\n\"This proviso was attached because some question was raised as to the status, under this bill, of employees who are temporarily promoted or demoted from one closely related craft or class to another. This practice, with minor exceptions, occurs only among the train- and engine-service employees. Thus a fireman may be promoted to a position as engineer for a short time and then due to a reduction in force be returned to his former position as fireman. It is the intention of this proviso to assure that in the case of such promotion or demotion, as the case may be, the employee involved shall not be deprived of his employment because of his failure or refusal to join the union representing the craft or class in which he is located if he retains his membership in the union representing the craft or class from which he has been transferred.\"\n24\n\u00a0\n\n\n Due to a temporary adjournment of the Senate, no action was taken on this amendment. When the bill was again taken up, however, a substitute amendment, which had been drafted by the railroad brotherhoods, was offered by Senators Hill and Taft.\n25\n The language of this substitute was that of the present Section 2, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 492]\n\u00a0\n Eleventh (c), providing that the requirement of membership under a union-shop contract is satisfied if the employee belongs to \"any one of the labor organizations, national in scope, organized in accordance with this Act.\"\n26\n Senator Hill explained that the purpose of this substitute was the same as that of the previous amendment:\n\n\"[The amendment does] nothing more nor less than what the committee desires to do, and what was the intent of the committee in offering its amendment, that no employee of a railroad should be required to belong to more than one labor organization. The only difference between the committee amendment and the amendments now before the Senate, which have been agreed upon by all the railroad organizations, is that the amendments now before the Senate spell out in much more detail the purposes of the committee amendment than did the committee amendment. But the intent and the purpose . . . are exactly the same.\"\n27\n\u00a0\n\n\n This amendment passed as introduced\n28\n and now forms subsection (c).\n\nIt thus becomes clear that the only purpose of Section 2, Eleventh (c) was a very narrow one: to prevent compulsory dual unionism or the necessity of changing from one union to another when an employee temporarily changes crafts.\n29\n The aim of the Section, which was \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 493]\n\u00a0\n drafted by the established unions themselves,\n30\n quite evidently was not to benefit rising new unions by permitting them to recruit members among employees who are represented by another labor organization. Nor was it intended to provide employees with a general right to join unions other than the designated bargaining representative of their craft, except to meet the narrow problem of intercraft mobility. This is made particularly clear when the provision is taken in the context of American labor relations in general. The National Labor Relations Act contains no parallel to subsection (c), and employees under a union-shop contract governed by that Act must join and maintain membership in the union designated as the bargaining representative or suffer discharge.\n31\n Similarly, subsection (c) does not apply to nonoperating employees, where the problem of seasonal intercraft movement does not exist. Railroad employees \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 494]\n\u00a0\n such as clerks working under a union-shop contract have no right at all to join a union other than the bargaining representative. In other words, once a union has lawfully established itself for a period of time as the authorized bargaining representative of the employees under a union-shop contract, Congress has never deemed it to be a \"right\" of employees to choose between membership in it and another competing union. If Congress intended to confer such a right, it would scarcely have denied the right to nonoperating employees of the railroads or industrial employees under the National Labor Relations Act. The purpose of Section 2, Eleventh (c) was simply to solve the problem of intercraft mobility under railroad union-shop contracts.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThere next arises for consideration the manner in which Congress achieved this purpose. Section 2, Eleventh (c) provides that for operating employees a union-shop contract can be satisfied by membership in \"any one of the labor organizations, national in scope, organized in accordance with this Act . . . .\" At first blush this would appear to confer on employees a blanket right to choose between alternative unions which are, in the abstract, national in scope and organized in accordance with the Act. But when taken in the context of the Railway Labor Act as a whole, it becomes apparent that this language refers to a certain group of unions, a group already constituted. For the language was borrowed from Section 3, First of the Act, which had been on the books for some 17 years, and which establishes precisely the same qualifications for those unions which are permitted to elect the labor members of the NRAB. Subsection (a) of Section 3, First provides that unions may become electors if they are \"national in scope\" and are \"organized in accordance \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 495]\n\u00a0\n with\" the Act.\n32\n Subsection (f) then spells out an impartial administrative method of tripartite arbitration whereby it can be decided whether a particular union meets these qualifications.\n33\n In other words, by writing into Section 2, Eleventh (c), standards identical to those of Section 3, Congress in Section 2 was evidently making reference to those unions which had qualified as electors under Section 3 through the administrative procedure there expressly provided.\n34\n This reference to an already constituted group of unions is emphasized by the fact that Congress in Section 2, Eleventh (c) did not say that an employee under a union-shop contract could join \"any\" labor organization which was national in scope and organized in accordance with the Act; rather it said that such an employee could join \"any one of the\" labor organizations which are national in scope and organized in accordance with the Act. In short, Congress in Section 2 was referring to a group of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 496]\n\u00a0\n unions already defined and constituted under the Section 3 procedures. And therefore an employee has available to him alternative membership only in such unions as have already qualified as electors under Section 3.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThis interpretation of the Act solves the problem which Congress faced without conferring on employees \"floating\" rights which Congress did not intend to grant. For the problem of intercraft mobility vanishes if the promoted fireman can remain in the firemen's brotherhood, even though his new craft is represented by a different union; and the firemen's brotherhood will, of course, already have qualified under the Act as an elector under Section 3. Furthermore, this interpretation avoids troublesome questions which would arise were we to hold that employees have a right to belong to any union which happens to be national in scope and organized in accordance with the Act. For, while Section 3, First provides an impartial administrative scheme to deal with precisely this question, Section 2, Eleventh (c), assuming it does not refer to an already defined group of unions qualified under Section 3, is silent on the procedure to determine whether a union meets its requirements. An entire new administrative scheme would have to be fashioned by the courts out of thin air to deal with this question, or the courts themselves would have to deal with it without prior administrative action. If System Boards, for example, are to be given jurisdiction to make such determinations, is there to be judicial review? What is to be the scope of such review? How is the inherent bias of the established-union members of these boards to be overcome? Would the determination of one Board (or one Circuit) that such a union as UROC is \"national in scope\" be binding on another Board or another Circuit? \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 497]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, to sanction such a \"floating\" right in employees would make only for confusion and uncertainty in labor relations in the railroad industry. No employee could with safety join an alternative union, for he could not know until after-the-fact adjudication whether that union meets the requirements of Section 2. On the other hand, interpreting Section 2 to refer to those unions which have already qualified as electors under Section 3 means that an employee will always know or can easily ascertain the unions which he can join as an alternative to his bargaining representative. A new union, such as UROC, could make itself available for such alternative membership by seeking certification as an elector through the impartial procedure of Section 3, First (f). And the decision of the \"board of three\" provided by that Section would be prospective, uniform throughout the nation, and would be the ruling of an administrative body established to deal with precisely this question.\n\nWe hold, therefore, that Section 2, Eleventh (c) of the Act makes only such unions available for alternative membership under a union-shop contract, such as this one, as have already qualified as electors for the labor members of the NRAB under Section 3, First. Since UROC has not so qualified, respondent has not stated a claim on which relief can be granted. The decision below must therefore be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 64 Stat. 1238 (1951), 45 U.S.C. 152, Eleventh (a) and (c).

This Section authorizes carriers and unions to set up \"system, group, or regional boards of adjustment\" to decide disputes otherwise within the jurisdiction of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, with a right in any party, dissatisfied with such an arrangement, to return to the jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board upon 90 days' notice. No such election was made here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The first hearing was on August 27, 1953, at which time the Board postponed decision pending further exploration into the status of UROC. The second hearing was on August 23, 1954. In the interim, Rychlik, on July 31, 1954, had joined the Switchmen's Union, and presented evidence of that membership at the second hearing. Rychlik's employment was continued until shortly after the Board's adverse decision on January 3, 1955.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 128 F. Supp. 449. The District Court, holding in effect that its jurisdiction to review the System Board was limited to ascertaining whether the Board had acted within the scope of its statutory and contract authority and whether its decision was free of fraud or corruption and the hearing consonant with procedural due process, found that no such infirmities had been shown, and in particular that \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 484]\n\u00a0\n the presence of two Brotherhood representatives on the System Board did not automatically vitiate its proceedings. It further held that Rychlik's belated membership in the Switchmen's Union did not satisfy the statutory and contract requirements of continuous maintenance of membership in a qualified union, and that the court need not decide whether UROC was a labor organization \"national in scope,\" since, under Section 3, First (f) of the Railway Labor Act, determination of that question was within the exclusive competence of the National Mediation Board.

However, the next-to-last proviso of Section 2, Eleventh (c) states that when \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 493]\n\u00a0\n a union-shop provision is first signed, employees not belonging to a qualified union may be required to join that union which represents the craft in which they are employed at the time the agreement becomes effective. See n. 13, supra. Thus when this agreement between petitioners was first put into effect, Rychlik, had he belonged to no union at all, would have been required to join the Brotherhood specifically, and could not have chosen to join even such competing unions which are concededly national in scope, not to speak of UROC. In other words, this proviso completely negates the argument that the purpose of the statute was to allow employees to choose between unions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] See Senator Hill's statement, 96 Cong. Rec. 16329: \"The representatives of the railway organizations sat around a table together and worked out the details of the amendment, and then brought it to the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Alabama, and we saw that the amendment was exactly similar to the committee amendment, except that it spelled out in more detail the safeguards which were deemed necessary in order to properly do the job.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] See Levinson, supra, n. 21.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] See n. 14, supra. The \"organized in accordance\" language refers to Section 2, Fourth, which prohibits company unions, and which had also been on the books since 1934. 48 Stat. 1187 (1934), 45 U.S.C. 152, Fourth.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] See n. 16, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] Respondent argues that the standards of Section 3 are not the same as those of Section 2, Eleventh (c), and that therefore the latter provision cannot refer to the unions qualified under the former. He points out that Section 3, First (f) makes it the duty of the board of three to determine whether the claimant union is \"organized in accordance with section 2 hereof and is otherwise properly qualified to participate in the selection of the labor members of the Adjustment Board,\" and argues that the words \"otherwise properly qualified\" must refer to qualifications not listed in Section 2, Eleventh (c). But we think it clear that these words merely incorporate by reference the qualifications listed in Section 3, First (a) for union electors, and the latter section defines these qualifications in terms identical to the union-shop section. See 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1512, 1514.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nThe decision below, if allowed to stand, would tend to dislocate the scheme that Congress has seen fit to devise for the regulation of industrial relations on railroads, and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 498]\n\u00a0\n so I join in reversing the judgment. But I get there by a different route from the Court's. In my view of the Railway Labor Act, the District Court had no jurisdiction of this action and the complaint should be dismissed for want of it, not on the merits.\n\nThe governing outlook for construing the Railway Labor Act is hospitable realization of the fact that it is primarily an instrument of industrial government for railroading by the industry itself, through the concentrated agencies of railroad executives and the railroad unions. (For details, see the dissenting opinions in Elgin, Joliet & Eastern R. Co. v. Burley, \n325 \nU.S. 711, 749\n; \n327 \nU.S. 661, 667\n.) The dominant inference that the Court has drawn from this fact is exclusion of the courts from this process of collaborative self-government. See, e. g., General Committee v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 323\n; Order of Railway Conductors v. Pitney, \n326 \nU.S. 561\n; Slocum v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 239\n. Neither Moore v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 630\n, nor Order of Railway Conductors v. Swan, \n329 \nU.S. 520\n, is fairly to be deemed an exception to the general principle and, in any event, those cases involve circumstances not relevant to the present situation.\n\nThere is one qualification to the principle I have stated, or, rather, there is a counter-principle to be respected. This is the doctrine established by Steele v. Louisville & N. R. Co., \n323 \nU.S. 192\n. The short of it is that since every railroad employee is represented by union agents who sit on a System Board of Adjustment, such representatives are in what amounts to a fiduciary position: they must not exercise their power in an arbitrary way against some minority interest. The fact of a general conflict of interest between a minority of union members and representatives designated by the majority does not of itself vitiate the presupposition of self-government and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 499]\n\u00a0\n does not of itself subject the System Board action to judicial review. Conflict between a majority and a minority is a commonplace in the whole collective bargaining process. But the bargaining representatives owe a judicially enforceable duty of fairness to all the components of the working force when a specific claim is in controversy.\n\nThe determination of the System Board on the merits is not open to judicial review, even on so-called legal questions. It is not for a court to say that a complaint against the System Board must fail because the System Board rightly held against the complainant. Right or wrong, a court has no jurisdiction to review what the System Board did, unless a complainant asserts arbitrariness and seeks to enforce the limited protection established in the Steele case. It is not for a court to decide as an abstract issue what procedure a union must or may pursue to establish its status as an organization \"national in scope,\" within 2, Eleventh (c) of the Railway Labor Act, nor whether or when an individual claiming through such a rival union may assert its claim for his benefit. (As bearing on the legal complexities raised by such interrelationship between a member and an organization, see the opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson in Joint Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath, \n341 \nU.S. 123, 183\n.)\n\nFor Rychlik to have brought himself within the Steele case it would have been necessary to charge that the System Board had made its determination arbitrarily and that on the basis of this arbitrary determination he had been discharged. On such a claim, and only on such a claim, would he have been entitled to judicial relief. In the absence of such a claim, the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 480, 500]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA v.

The provisions of the will were carried out by the State and City and the college was opened in 1848. Since 1869, by virtue of an act of the Pennsylvania Legislature, the trust has been administered and the college operated by the \"Board of Directors of City Trusts of the City of Philadelphia.\" Pa.

They met all qualifications except that they were Negroes. For this reason the Board refused to admit them. They petitioned the Orphans' Court of Philadelphia County for an order directing the Board to admit them, alleging that their exclusion because of race violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The State of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia joined in the suit also contending the Board's action violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The Orphans' Court rejected the constitutional contention and refused to order the applicants' admission. 4 D. & C. 2d 671 (Orph. Ct. Philadelphia). This was affirmed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 386 Pa. 548, 127 A. 2d 287.\n\nThe Board which operates Girard College is an agency of the State of Pennsylvania.

Nearly two years later, in 1954, upon petitioner's arrest for violation of probation, the District Court entered a formal judgment and commitment sentencing petitioner to 2 years' imprisonment and setting aside the earlier judgment and order.

On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Ralph S. Spritzer, Beatrice Rosenberg and Robert G. Maysack.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case concerns the validity of a sentence imposed on petitioner in September 1954. On September 8, 1952, petitioner pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota to an information charging him with the unlawful taking and embezzlement of a United States Treasury check in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1702. The district judge deferred imposition of sentence pending presentence investigation. On October 3, 1952, petitioner appeared before the trial judge at 10 a.m. for sentencing. He was then serving a sentence in a Minnesota state prison, from which he was eligible for parole the following month. The judge stated that the probation report showed that petitioner had taken an active interest in the Alcoholics Anonymous organization in prison, and petitioner told him that he contemplated continuing that interest when he was released from the state prison. The judge added that he was impressed by the fact that petitioner, who had stolen the check after a two-week drinking spree, had revealed what he had done to an officer of Alcoholics Anonymous and to the FBI without any effort to minimize the offense. He advised petitioner to join Alcoholics Anonymous immediately on his release from the state prison. He then said:\n\n\". . . if you want to revert to drinking, you will be back here again because you will commit some federal offense, and I won't be talking to you this way if you are ever before me again. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  \"So, good luck to you and I hope the parole board  will give you an opportunity.\n\n\n  \"That is all.\"\n\n\n The judge then turned to other business.\n\nIt is clear that no explicit reference to petitioner's sentence had been made during this colloquy. But before the court adjourned at 10:30 a. m., when petitioner apparently had left the courtroom, an assistant United States District Attorney handling the matter said:\n\n  \"Going back to the matter of Thomas E. Pollard who appeared this morning - I didn't quite understand that clearly - is there to be a probationary period after his release from Stillwater, or any type of sentencing?\n\n\n \"The Court: It is to commence at the expiration of sentencing at Stillwater.\n\n\n \"Mr. Hachey: Probation to commence after expiration of his sentencing at Stillwater - for how long?\n\n\n \"The Court: Three years.\"\n\n\n A judgment and order of probation was then entered suspending imposition of sentence and placing petitioner on probation for that term. The Government concedes that the judgment and order was invalid because of petitioner's absence from the courtroom when probation was imposed. Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., 43.\n\nPetitioner did not receive a copy of this order, despite a direction of the court, but learned of the probation from state prison officials the following month when he was paroled. On his release he began reporting to the federal probation officer. Nearly two years later, on September 1, 1954, the trial judge issued a bench warrant for petitioner's arrest on the basis of the probation officer's report that petitioner had violated the terms of his probation. Petitioner was arrested and brought before the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n court on September 21, 1954. After waiver of counsel by petitioner, the following occurred at the hearing:\n\n  \"The Court: What I am going to do in your case,  because of the record, is to sentence you in the first  instance: It's the judgment of the Court that you be  confined in an institution to be selected by the Attorney  General of the United States for a period of two  years. That's all.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Evarts [Asst. U.S. Attorney]: Now, Your  Honor, as you recall, the record shows that he was,  sentence was imposed on October 3, 1952, and I  would suggest to the Court that an Order be made  setting aside the judgment and commitment that  was entered at that time so that the record will now  truly reflect the status of the events.\n\n\n  \"The Court: All right.\"\n\n\n A formal judgment and commitment was then entered, sentencing petitioner to two years' imprisonment and setting aside the judgment and order of probation entered on October 3, 1952.\n\nPetitioner's motion to vacate this sentence under 28 U.S.C. 2255 was based upon a misapprehension of the basis for the sentence of 1954. He contended that, since his 1952 probation sentence was invalid, his 1954 prison sentence was also invalid because it was for probation violation. Actually, of course, it was punishment for the embezzlement. The District Court denied the motion on the ground that \"[Petitioner] was initially sentenced upon September 21, 1954, and the files and records in the case conclusively show that said judgment was within the jurisdiction of the court and the sentence imposed was valid and in accordance with law.\" Petitioner filed a notice of appeal and a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. The District Court denied this motion \"in all respects.\" Petitioner then filed a motion for leave \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n to appeal in forma pauperis in the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. After examination of the record in the District Court, the Court of Appeals denied this motion without opinion. This Court granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and, deeming the issues as to the validity of the 1954 sentence of importance in the proper administration of the criminal law, granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 965\n. We also appointed counsel for petitioner. \n350 \nU.S. 980\n.\n\nPetitioner was released from federal prison in March 1956, after his petition for certiorari had been granted. He relies on United States v. Morgan, \n346 \nU.S. 502, 512\n-513, and Fiswick v. United States, \n329 \nU.S. 211, 220\n-223, as meeting the question of mootness that this fact suggests. Those cases are not entirely on all fours with this one, since petitioner is challenging the legality not of any determination of guilt, but instead of the sentence imposed. But those cases recognize that convictions may entail collateral legal disadvantages in the future. Appeals from convictions are allowed only after sentences. Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., 37. The determination of guilt and the sentence are essential for imprisonment. We think that petitioner's reference to the above cases sufficiently satisfies the requirement that review in this Court will be allowed only where its judgment will have some material effect. Cf. St. Pierre v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 41\n. The possibility of consequences collateral to the imposition of sentence is sufficiently substantial to justify our dealing with the merits.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe petition for certiorari, pro se, sought reversal of the order of the Court of Appeals denying petitioner's motion for appeal in forma pauperis and also release from his then incarceration.\n2\n Petitioner contended that the 1954 \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n sentence was unconstitutional because it was imposed for violation of the invalid probation order.\n\nPetitioner now, in his brief, claims that the trial judge determined on October 3, 1952, that no imprisonment and no probation should be imposed, and that consequently the imposition of sentence in September 1954 violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. He claims alternatively that the imposition of sentence in September 1954 in the circumstances under which it took place constituted a serious departure from proper standards of criminal law administration and violated his rights to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment and to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.\n3\n The record now before us adequately states the facts for a final determination of the basic issues. Since the Court of Appeals' denial of petitioner's appeal involved an adjudication of the merits, i. e., that there was no adequate basis for allowance of appeal in forma pauperis, we think the validity of the 1954 sentence for embezzlement should now be decided. And we conclude that it is proper that we deal with the questions as to legality of the 1954 sentence that petitioner now raises, although, had petitioner been represented by counsel in the courts below and upon his petition for certiorari, we might well have considered those questions neither preserved below nor raised in the petition. Cf. Price v. Johnston, \n334 \nU.S. 266, 292\n.\n\nI. The contention that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids the 1954 sentence may be shortly answered. It depends upon the assertion that the trial court determined in 1952 that petitioner \"should not be subject to imprisonment or probation\" on his plea of guilty to embezzlement. Without such a determination, there could not be double jeopardy. The transcript \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n of evidence, all pertinent parts of which are quoted in the first part of this opinion, shows no such determination. The petitioner cites no words upon which he relies. The only sentence that was entered at the 1952 hearing was the one of probation, admittedly invalid because of petitioner's absence.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIt is clear to us, too, that the District Court did not by implication intend to acquit or dismiss the defendant. Within the morning session of court, when his failure to make explicit the sentence was called to his attention, the judge directed entry of the order suspending sentence and instituting probation. There is no occasion here for distinguishing between an oral pronouncement of sentence and its entry on the records of the court. Cf. Spriggs v. United States, 225 F.2d 865, 868. Nor does the situation call for a determination of the correctness of petitioner's assertion that a federal judge has power, under a statute without minimum penalties,\n5\n to release or discharge an accused absolutely after conviction or plea of guilty without sentence, suspension of sentence or grant of probation.\n6\n It is unfortunate for inadvertencies to lead to confusion in criminal trials, but such misunderstanding as petitioner may have drawn from the occurrences at the 1952 sentence is not a basis for vacating the later sentence. The mishap of the prisoner's absence when the first sentence was pronounced cannot be a basis for vacating the 1954 sentence here \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n involved. If the probation sentence had been valid, petitioner on its violation would have been subject to the sentence actually imposed in 1954. 18 U.S.C. 3653; Roberts v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 264, 268\n.\n\nII. Petitioner's other contentions relate to violations of constitutional rights of speedy trial and due process, and significant departure from proper standards of criminal law administration. It is not disputed that a court has power to enter sentence at a succeeding term where a void sentence had been previously imposed. Miller v. Aderhold, \n288 \nU.S. 206\n; cf. Bozza v. United States, \n330 \nU.S. 160, 166\n. To hold otherwise would allow the guilty to escape punishment through a legal accident.\n\nPetitioner argues that the 1954 sentence violated his right under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution to a \"speedy\" trial.\n7\n He takes this position on the assumption that the case remained, as we have held above, uncompleted after the 1952 trial. We will assume arguendo that sentence is part of the trial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. The time for sentence is of course not at the will of the judge. Rule 32 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the imposition of sentence \"without unreasonable delay.\"\n\nWhether delay in completing a prosecution such as here occurred amounts to an unconstitutional deprivation of rights depends upon the circumstances. See, e. g., Beavers v. Haubert, \n198 \nU.S. 77, 87\n; Frankel v. Woodrough, 7 F.2d 796, 798. The delay must not be purposeful or oppressive. It was not here. It was accidental and was promptly remedied when discovered. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 362]\n\u00a0\n\n\n Nothing in the record indicates any delay in sentencing after discovery of the 1952 error. From the issuance of the warrant in September 1954 for the violation of probation, the normal inference would be that the error was still unknown to the court, although petitioner states he had known of it since November 1952.\n8\n We do not have in this case circumstances akin to those in United States v. Provoo, 17 F. R. D. 183, 201, aff'd mem. \n350 \nU.S. 857\n, where Judge Thomsen found the delay \"caused by the deliberate act of the government\" which the accused attempted to correct. The same situation existed in United States v. McWilliams, 82 U.S. App. D.C. 259, 163 F.2d 695, where the Government's failure to be ready for trial persisted for nearly two years despite defendant's motions for trial. In these circumstances, we do not view the lapse of time before correction of the error as a violation of the Sixth Amendment or of Rule 32 (a). Error in the course of a prosecution resulting in conviction calls for the correction of the error, not the release of the accused. Dowd v. Cook, \n340 \nU.S. 206, 210\n.\n\nPetitioner contends also that, in sentencing him for the embezzlement in 1954, the judge disregarded the standards prescribed for such a proceeding. He points out that the transcript of evidence shows that the prosecuting attorney in open court, instead of the judge, inquired of petitioner as to waiver of his right to counsel. He suggests that this violates Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n9\n On the same transcript authority, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 363]\n\u00a0\n he makes the suggestion that Rules 32 (a) and 37 (a) (2) were disregarded concerning opportunity \"to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment\" and advice to a defendant \"not represented by counsel . . . of his right to appeal.\" Petitioner argues that these irregularities constitute a denial of due process. While we do not impose on persons unlearned in the law the same high standards of the legal art that we might place on the members of the legal profession, we think that these issues are too far afield from the questions that petitioner raised in the courts below and in his petition for certiorari for them properly to be before us. In any case, the formal commitment papers signed by the judge show that these steps, except that of advising petitioner of his right to appeal, were actually taken. We are not willing to conclude from the transcript of evidence covering only such notes as were \"taken at the above time and place\" that the above purely routine statutory requirements were not followed.\n\nThis leaves unresolved the question whether the Court of Appeals' denial of leave to appeal was proper. Since we conclude that petitioner must lose on the merits, nothing could be gained by a remand to the Court of Appeals even if we should be of the opinion that the Court of Appeals erred in denying leave to appeal.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, dissenting.\n\nOur duty to supervise the administration of justice in the federal courts calls for a reversal here because of disregard shown for the procedural rights of petitioner - rights with which the law surrounds every person charged with crime. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 364]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur law, based upon centuries of tragic human experience, requires that before a man can be sent to a penitentiary, he is entitled to a speedy trial, to be present in court at every step of the proceedings, at all times to be represented by counsel, or to speak in his own behalf, and to be informed in open court of every action taken against him until he is lawfully sentenced. These are not mere ceremonials to be neglected at will in the interests of a crowded calendar or other expediencies. They are basic rights. They bulk large in the totality of procedural rights guaranteed to a person accused of crime. Here, in the case of an impecunious defendant, who was summarily rushed through the court mill without benefit of counsel, all of them, in some degree, were denied him.\n\nThe petitioner was not a dangerous criminal. His trouble, as the court recognized, was intemperance. During the course of a long drinking spree, he became involved with both the state and federal authorities. As soon as he became sober enough to realize the consequences of his actions, he made a full disclosure to one of the officers of Alcoholics Anonymous and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nHe was sentenced to a state penitentiary. He was also charged by the Federal Government with unlawfully opening a letter and extracting a check which he cashed. The case was not pressed until petitioner was about to be discharged from the state penitentiary.\n1\n Without counsel, he pleaded guilty. He was then \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 365]\n\u00a0\n brought into court to receive sentence. The colloquy between him and the court concluded as follows:\n\n \"The Court: You ought to know the misery and the grief and the sorrow and the horror of what continued drinking on your part will bring to you.\n\n\n \"If I might suggest to you, and I am giving you gratuitous advice but it is the result of observation and experience - it is my view that when you get out you should immediately join the Alcoholics Anonymous organization - not wait a week or two weeks or three weeks - but have that your first mission after you contact your family, and do what they tell you to do and do it immediately and do it diligently and faithfully, carry out every obligation that they impose upon you. With your background and with your ability I think that you can win this fight.\n\n\n \"If you don't do those things, and if you want to revert to drinking, you will be back here again because you will commit some federal offense, and I won't be talking to you this way if you are ever before me again.\n\n\n \"So, good luck to you and I hope the parole board will give you an opportunity.\n\n\n \"That is all.\n\n\n \"The Defendant: Thank you very much, sir.\"\n\n\n Petitioner's wife, a close personal friend and the two state custodial officers who were present at the hearing concluded, as would anyone, that the kindly and understanding language of the judge ended the matter and that additional punishment was not to be imposed. Petitioner was returned to the state penitentiary. Later in the day, after an inquiry by the prosecuting attorney as to the disposition of the case, the judge casually said, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 366]\n\u00a0\n \"Three years [probation].\"\n2\n Petitioner was absent when this occurred.\n3\n Notice of this action was not even communicated to him. A month or so later, as he was being released from the state prison, the officials advised him that he must report to the federal probation officer. Naturally, he complied. But he immediately tried to discover, through the probation officer, how and why he was subject to probation. The officer succeeded in convincing him that the \"sentence\" was legal. Again, a year later, petitioner requested his probation officer to investigate. The officer discovered the truth of petitioner's assertions. Though he recognized the irregularity of the proceedings, he suggested to petitioner that it would not be wise to pursue the matter - that further complications might develop.\n\nIn September 1954, nearly two years after his first appearance before the court for sentencing, petitioner lapsed in the fight against excessive drinking. Reported as a probation violator, he was again brought into federal court. His case was disposed of in the most summary style. The Assistant United States Attorney first obtained the defendant's statement waiving right to counsel. He was not advised by the court, as required by law, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 367]\n\u00a0\n of his right to counsel and to the appointment of counsel if desired. Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., 44. The judge, but not petitioner, had apparently been apprised beforehand of the illegality of the October 3, 1952, sentence.\n\n \"The Court: What I am going to do in your case, because of the record, is to sentence you in the first instance: It's the judgment of the Court that you be confined in an institution to be selected by the Attorney General of the United States for a period of two years. That's all.\n\n\n \"Mr. Evarts [Prosecuting Attorney]: Now, Your Honor, as you recall, the record shows that he was, sentence was imposed on October 3, 1952, and I would suggest to the Court that an Order be made setting aside the judgment and commitment that was entered at that time so that the record will now truly reflect the status of the events.\n\n\n \"The Court: All right.\"\n\n\n In this Court the Government concedes the total invalidity of the \"sentence\" of October 3, 1952, and contends that these events of September 21, 1954, are to be treated as the first and only sentence imposed on the defendant for the crime of which he had pleaded guilty in 1952. But it too has infirmities. It cannot be said that this long delayed sentencing hearing comports with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. As already stated, petitioner was not represented by counsel. There was no attempt to comply with Rule 37 (a) (2), which provides that: \"When a court after trial imposes sentence upon a defendant not represented by counsel, the defendant shall be advised of his right to appeal . . . .\" Furthermore, Rule 32 (a) contains a mandatory requirement: \"Before imposing sentence the court shall afford the defendant an opportunity to make \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 368]\n\u00a0\n a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.\" No opportunity was afforded the defendant to say a word in mitigation or extenuation of his offense.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner also questions the power of the trial court to sentence him so long after arraignment. The Sixth Amendment guarantees to persons accused of crimes in a federal court that they shall receive a \"speedy and public trial.\" It has never been held that the sentence is not part of the \"trial.\" But it is not necessary to decide this issue on constitutional grounds. The principle has been implemented by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nRule 32 (a) declares unequivocally that: \"Sentence shall be imposed without unreasonable delay.\" The majority holds that this two-year delay is not unreasonable because it was \"accidental\" and was \"promptly remedied when discovered.\" There is nothing in the record to warrant either of these conclusions. Both the court and the prosecuting attorney were put on notice of the fatal defect of the abortive sentence on the day it was imposed. No steps were taken to remedy the defect. Petitioner declared that he twice initiated investigation of the legality of his sentence. The probation officer obviously checked with someone long before petitioner was brought to court for what is now called his \"first\" sentence. We cannot simply assume that the facts did not come to the attention of any responsible person.\n\nThis proceeding was initiated as a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. 2255. The district judge refused to accord petitioner a hearing and, considering only the motion and the files and records in the court, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 354, 369]\n\u00a0\n denied relief. Then, in spite of the infirmities in the case revealed by these documents, leave to appeal in forma pauperis was denied. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed this action, but we granted certiorari and appointed counsel to represent petitioner.\n\nThe conclusion that the condonation of this succession of procedural shortcomings represents a restriction of petitioner's rights is inescapable. This Court has often said that such departures from accepted standards should not be permitted - that to do so encourages looseness in many ways. Petitioner has served the two years of imprisonment while pursuing his remedy to this Court. We cannot \"unring\" the bell that so casually sent him to prison, but we can and should make the record show that he was not committed to a federal prison in accordance with the accepted standard of criminal procedure.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The alleged offense occurred on or about May 21, 1951. A complaint was signed the following July. Nothing further ensued in the case until September 8, 1952. On that date the United States Attorney filed an information and petitioner entered his plea of guilty.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"The Court: Is there anything else, Mr. Hachey [Prosecuting Attorney]?\n\n\"Mr. Hachey: Going back to the matter of Thomas E. Pollard who appeared this morning - I didn't quite understand that clearly - is there to be a probationary period after his release from Stillwater, or any type of sentencing?\n\n\n\"The Court: It is to commence at the expiration of sentencing at Stillwater.\n\n\n\"Mr. Hachey: Probation to commence after expiration of his sentencing at Stillwater - for how long?\n\n\n\"The Court: Three years.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Government concedes that the probation sentence was completely invalid because it was imposed in petitioner's absence.

He was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for the robbery and 15 years for the entering, the two sentences to run consecutively. Held: The sentence was illegal, and he must be resentenced on the conviction on the robbery count only.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented by this case calls for interpretation of the Federal Bank Robbery Act. 18 U.S.C. 2113. \n1\n That statute creates and defines several crimes incidental to and related to thefts from banks organized or insured under federal laws. Included are bank robbery and entering a bank with intent to commit a robbery.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 322, 324]\n\u00a0\n We must decide here whether unlawful entry and robbery are two offenses consecutively punishable in a typical bank robbery situation.\n\nPetitioner entered the Malone State Bank, in Malone, Texas, through an open door and during regular banking hours. He asked for and received certain directions. Thereupon he displayed a revolver, intimidating a bank employee and putting his life in jeopardy, and thus consummated a robbery. A grand jury returned a two-count indictment against him. The first charged the robbery offense; the second, entering the bank with the intent to commit a felony. Petitioner was convicted on both counts, and the district judge sentenced him to 20 years for robbery and 15 years for entering. The sentences were directed to be served consecutively. Some years thereafter, petitioner filed a \"Motion to Vacate or Correct Illegal Sentence.\" The District Court, treating it as a proceeding under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, denied relief without conducting a hearing. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 230 F.2d 568.\n\nWhether the crime of entering a bank with intent to commit a robbery is merged with the crime of robbery when the latter is consummated has puzzled the courts for several years. A conflict has arisen between the circuits.\n3\n We granted certiorari because of the recurrence \n\n[352 \nU.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n of the question and to resolve the conflict. \n351 \nU.S. 962\n. In addition to the Court of Appeals cases on the precise question, both petitioner and the Government cite as analogous other cases that involved fragmentation of crimes for purposes of punishment.\n4\n None of these is particularly helpful to us because we are dealing with a unique statute of limited purpose and an inconclusive legislative history. It can and should be differentiated from similar problems in this general field raised under other statutes. The question of interpretation is a narrow one, and our decision should be correspondingly narrow.\n\nThe original Bank Robbery Act was passed in 1934. It covered only robbery, robbery accompanied by an aggravated assault, and homicide perpetrated in committing a robbery or escaping thereafter. In 1937 the Attorney General requested that the Act be amended. In his letter proposing the bill, the Attorney General declared that \n\n[352 \nU.S. 322, 326]\n\u00a0\n \"incongruous results\" had developed under the existing law. He cited as a striking instance the case of\n\n\". . . a man [who] was arrested in a national bank while walking out of the building with $11,000 of the bank's funds on his person. He had managed to gain possession of the money during a momentary absence of one of the employees, without displaying any force or violence and without putting anyone in fear - necessary elements of the crime of robbery - and was about to leave the bank when apprehended. As a result, it was not practicable to prosecute him under any Federal statute.\"\n\n\n The Act was amended accordingly to add other crimes less serious than robbery. Two larceny provisions were enacted: one for thefts of property exceeding $50, the other for lesser amounts. Congress further made it a crime to\n\n\". . . enter or attempt to enter any bank. . . . with intent to commit in such bank or building, or part thereof, so used, any felony or larceny . . . .\"\n\n\n Robbery, entering and larceny were all placed in one paragraph of the 1937 Act.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nCongress provided for maximum penalties of either a prison term or a fine or both for each of these offenses. Robbery remained punishable by 20 years and $5,000. The larceny penalties were set according to the degree of the offense. Simple larceny could result in 1 year in jail and $1,000 fine, while the maximum for the more serious theft was set at 10 years and $5,000. No separate \n\n[352 \nU.S. 322, 327]\n\u00a0\n penalty clause was added for the crime of unlawfully entering. It was simply incorporated into the robbery provision.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government asks us to interpret this statute as amended to make each a completely independent offense. It is unnecessary to do so in order to vindicate the apparent purpose of the amendment. The only factor stressed by the Attorney General in his letter to Congress was the possibility that a thief might not commit all the elements of the crime of robbery. It was manifestly the purpose of Congress to establish lesser offenses. But in doing so there was no indication that Congress intended also to pyramid the penalties.\n\nThe Attorney General cited the situation of larceny to illustrate his position. It is highly unlikely that he would have wanted to have the offender given 10 years for the larceny plus 20 years for entering the bank with intent to steal. There is no reason to suppose that he wished to have the maximum penalty for robbery doubled by the imposition of 20 years for the robbery to which could be added 20 years for entering the bank.\n7\n Nor is \n\n[352 \nU.S. 322, 328]\n\u00a0\n there anything in the reports of the House of Representatives or the Senate or the floor debates to warrant such a reading of the statute.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIt is a fair inference from the wording in the Act, uncontradicted by anything in the meager legislative history, that the unlawful entry provision was inserted to cover the situation where a person enters a bank for the purpose of committing a crime, but is frustrated for some reason before completing the crime. The gravamen of the offense is not in the act of entering, which satisfies the terms of the statute even if it is simply walking through an open, public door during normal business hours.\n9\n Rather the heart of the crime is the intent to steal. This mental element merges into the completed crime if the robbery is consummated. To go beyond this reasoning would compel us to find that Congress intended, by the 1937 amendment, to make drastic changes in authorized punishments. This we cannot do. If Congress had so intended, the result could have been accomplished easily with certainty rather than by indirection.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 322, 329]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe hold, therefore, that when Congress made either robbery or an entry for that purpose a crime it intended that the maximum punishment for robbery should remain at 20 years,\n11\n but that, even if the culprit should fall short of accomplishing his purpose, he could be imprisoned for 20 years for entering with the felonious intent.\n\nWhile reasonable minds might differ on this conclusion, we think it is consistent with our policy of not attributing to Congress, in the enactment of criminal statutes, an intention to punish more severely than the language of its laws clearly imports in the light of pertinent legislative history.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for the purpose of resentencing the petitioner in accordance with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON dissents for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, 230 F.2d 568.\n\nMR.

(1946 ed.) 588b (a). The statute in its present form was enacted by the June 1948 revision. 18 U.S.C. 2113 (a). The legislative history indicates that no substantial change was made in this revision. It segregated the larceny provisions in 2113 (b), leaving robbery and unlawful entry in 2113 (a). See note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Bank Robbery Act has, since it was passed in 1934, contained a special provision for increased punishment for aggravated offenses. One who, in committing robbery, assaults any person or puts the life of any person in jeopardy by the use of a dangerous weapon can be sentenced to 25 years in jail or fined $10,000 or both. When the Act was amended in 1937 to add larceny and unlawful entry, these were incorporated in the same paragraph with robbery and thus made subject to the increased penalty under aggravating circumstances. This provision currently is found in 18 U.S.C. 2113 (d). See note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Under the government view, if carried to its logical extreme, one who enters a bank and commits a robbery could be sentenced to 20 years for robbery, 10 years for larceny and 20 years for unlawful entry. The Government conceded that this was error in Heflin v. United States, 223 F.2d 371 (robbery and larceny). However, it now declares that its confession of error was made by mistake and that larceny and robbery are separate offenses, cumulatively punishable.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] H. R. Rep.

Rec. 2731, 4656, 5376-5377, 9331.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] This distinguishes the unlawful entry provision in the Bank Robbery Act from a very similar provision relating to post-office offenses. 18 U.S.C. 2115:\n\n\"Whoever forcibly breaks into or attempts to break into any post office, or any building used in whole or in part as a post office, with intent to commit in such post office, or building, or part thereof, so used, any larceny or other depredation, shall be fined . . . .\" (Italics supplied.)\n\n\n This section was held to create an offense separate from a completed post-office theft. Morgan v. Devine, \n237 \nU.S. 632\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Further evidence that Congress was concerned only with proscribing additional activities and not with alteration of the scheme of penalties is revealed by the form in which the bill was cast. Introduced in the House of Representatives, the proposal merely interjected into the robbery provision clauses making larceny and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 322, 329]\n\u00a0\n entering criminal. H. R. 5900, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.; H. R. Rep. No. 732, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 2. All three would have made violators subject to the existing penalty clause. During the debate on the floor, Rep. Wolcott pointed to the incongruity of establishing degrees of larceny without corresponding discrimination in punishment. 81 Cong. Rec. 4656.

BOYD(1957)\nNo. 403\nArgued: May 1, 1957Decided: May 27, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, born in 1910 in the Philippine Islands, has resided in the continental United States since 1930 when he was admitted for permanent residence. He was convicted in February 1951 of violating the federal narcotics laws. After administrative proceedings, he was ordered deported under the Act of February 18, 1931, as amended, which provides for the deportation of \"any alien\" convicted of violating a federal narcotics law. Petitioner's application for habeas corpus was denied by the Federal District Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: Petitioner was deportable under the 1931 Act, and the judgment is affirmed. Pp. 428-433.\n\n (a) Under 14 of the Philippine Independence Act of 1934, persons born in the Philippine Islands, and who thereby were nationals of the United States, became aliens on July 4, 1946, regardless of permanent residence in the continental United States on that date. Pp. 429-431.\n\n\n (b) \"Entry\" from a foreign country was not a condition of deportability in the 1931 Act. Barber v. Gonzales, \n347 \nU.S. 637\n, distinguished. P. 431.\n\n\n (c) In the provision of the 1931 Act that deportation shall be accomplished \"in manner provided in sections 19 and 20\" of the Immigration Act of 1917, the reference to the \"manner provided\" in those sections draws into the 1931 Act not the requirement of \"entry,\" but only the procedural steps for securing deportation set forth in those sections. Pp. 431-432.\n\n\n (d) The requirement of \"entry\" cannot be said to be implicit in the 1931 Act on the ground that the power to deport depends upon the power to exclude, and the power to exclude did not extend to Filipinos. Congress not only had, but exercised, the power to exclude Filipinos in 8 (a) (1) of the Independence Act. Pp. 432-433.\n\n\n 234 F.2d 904, affirmed. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJohn Caughlan argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nJ. F. Bishop argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney and Beatrice Rosenberg.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner, born in 1910 in the Philippine Islands, has lived in the continental United States since 1930, when he was admitted for permanent residence. In February 1951, he was convicted upon a plea of guilty of violating the federal narcotics laws. He was taken into custody in March 1951, and, after administrative proceedings, was ordered deported under the Act of February 18, 1931, as amended, which provided for the deportation of \"any alien\" convicted of violating a federal narcotics law.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner applied to the District Court for the Western District of Washington for a writ of habeas corpus and declaratory relief from the order of the Immigration and Naturalization Service deporting him to the Philippine \n\n[353 \nU.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n Islands. The District Court denied the petitioner's application, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\n2\n We granted certiorari.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe sole issue for decision is whether the petitioner is deportable as an alien within the meaning of the 1931 Act. The parties agree that the petitioner was a national of the United States at birth and when he entered the continental United States for permanent residence. Under the 1898 Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded the Philippine Islands to the United States.\n4\n Article IX of the Treaty provided that \". . . [t]he civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants . . . shall be determined by the Congress.\"\n5\n Pursuant to that Article, the Congress declared, inter alia, in the Act of July 1, 1902, that Filipinos born in the Islands after 1899 were to \". . . be citizens of the Philippine Islands and as such entitled to the protection of the United States . . . .\"\n6\n The Filipinos, as nationals, owed an obligation of permanent allegiance to this country.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nUpon the proclamation of Philippine independence on July 4, 1946,\n8\n 14 of the Philippine Independence Act of 1934 became operative. Section 14 provided:\n\n \"Upon the final and complete withdrawal of American sovereignty over the Philippine Islands the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n immigration laws of the United States (including all the provisions thereof relating to persons ineligible to citizenship) shall apply to persons who were born in the Philippine Islands to the same extent as in the case of other foreign countries.\" 48 Stat. 464, 48 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 1244.\n\n\n The Court of Appeals held that the petitioner lost his status as a national when the United States relinquished its sovereignty over the Islands on July 4, 1946, and that this occurred regardless of his residence in the continental United States on that date.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThe petitioner argues that his status as a national, acquired at birth under the Treaty and the 1902 statute, bears such close relationship to the constitutionally secured birthright of citizenship acquired by the American-born, that its divestiture should rest only upon the most explicit expression of congressional intention. In the Independence Act, the Congress granted full and complete independence to the Islands, and necessarily severed the obligation of permanent allegiance owed by Filipinos who were nationals of the United States. Anything less than the severance of the ties for all Filipinos, regardless of residence in or out of the continental United States, would not have fulfilled our long-standing national policy to grant independence to the Philippine people. See Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, \n324 \nU.S. 652, 674\n-678, 692. Section 14 of the Independence Act in clear language applies \"to persons who were born in the Philippine Islands.\" This language demonstrates, and we hold, as did the courts below, that persons born in the Islands, and who thereby were nationals of the United States, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n became aliens on July 4, 1946, regardless of permanent residence in the continental United States on that date.\n\nThe petitioner contends that, because he was admitted for permanent residence at the time the Islands were a territory of the United States, he did not enter from a foreign country and therefore cannot be an alien within the purview of the 1931 Act. He relies on Barber v. Gonzales, \n347 \nU.S. 637\n, where this Court held that a Filipino admitted for permanent residence in 1930 was not deportable under 19 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1917 as an alien sentenced for certain crimes \"committed . . . after entry.\" (Emphasis added.) The word \"entry\" was held to be significant of a congressional purpose to limit deportation under 19 (a) to aliens arriving \"from some foreign port or place,\" a description which did not fit a territory belonging to the United States. But the 1931 Act differs from the 1917 Act because it is silent as to whether \"entry\" from a foreign country is a condition of deportability. By its terms, the 1931 Act applies to \". . . any alien . . . who, after . . . [February 18, 1931], shall be convicted . . .\" of a federal narcotics offense. It follows that the holding in Gonzales is not applicable.\n\nThe petitioner argues that the requirement of \"entry,\" as construed in Gonzales, was incorporated into the 1931 Act by the provision that deportation shall be accomplished \"in manner provided in sections 19 and 20\" of the Immigration Act of 1917.\n10\n We hold that the reference \n\n[353 \nU.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n to the \"manner provided\" in those sections draws into the 1931 Act only the procedural steps for securing deportation set forth in those sections. Bugajewitz v. Adams, \n228 \nU.S. 585\n. The Congress adopted these procedures by reference instead of spelling them out in the 1931 Act.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThe petitioner urges finally that the requirement of \"entry\" is implicit in the 1931 Act. Citing Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698\n, he argues that the bounds of the power to deport aliens are circumscribed by the bounds of the power to exclude them, and that the power to exclude extends only to \"foreigners\" and does not embrace Filipinos admitted from the Islands when they were a territory of the United States. It is true that Filipinos were not excludable from the country under any general statute relating to the exclusion of \"aliens.\" See Gonzales v. Williams, \n192 \nU.S. 1, 12\n-13; Toyota v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 402, 411\n.\n\nBut the fallacy in the petitioner's argument is the erroneous assumption that Congress was without power to legislate the exclusion of Filipinos in the same manner as \"foreigners.\" This Court has held that \". . . the power to acquire territory by treaty implies not only the power to govern such territory, but to prescribe upon what terms the United States will receive its inhabitants, and what their status shall be . . . .\" Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244, 279\n.\n12\n Congress not only had, but exercised, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n the power to exclude Filipinos in the provision of 8 (a) (1) of the Independence Act, which, for the period from 1934 to 1946, provided:\n\n \"For the purposes of the Immigration Act of 1917, the Immigration Act of 1924 (except section 13 (c)), this section, and all other laws of the United States relating to the immigration, exclusion, or expulsion of aliens, citizens of the Philippine Islands who are not citizens of the United States shall be considered as if they were aliens. For such purposes the Philippine Islands shall be considered as a separate country and shall have for each fiscal year a quota of fifty. . . .\" 48 Stat. 462, 48 U.S.C. (1934 ed.)  1238.\n\n\n The 1931 Act plainly covers the situation of the petitioner, who was an alien, and who was convicted of a federal narcotics offense. Cf. United States ex rel. Eichenlaub v. Shaughnessy, \n338 \nU.S. 521\n. We therefore conclude that the petitioner was deportable as an alien under that Act. The judgment is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act of February 18, 1931, as amended, provided:\n\n\". . .

See also Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244, 280\n, as to the status of the inhabitants of other territories acquired by the United States.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nThe Act of February 18, 1931, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 156a, provided for the deportation of \"any alien\" convicted of violating a narcotic law after the date of the Act. Petitioner is a citizen of the Philippines and is therefore an alien by virtue of the Philippine Independence Act, 48 Stat. 456, c. 84, 8; and he was convicted of narcotics violation in 1951, which was after his status had been changed from a national to an alien. If the 1931 Act is to be read literally, the deportation of this Filipino is warranted. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n But to read the Act literally is, I think, to miss its real import.\n\nFirst. In 1931 the only aliens here were those who had made an \"entry\" into this country. The condition of \"entry\" seems, therefore, necessarily implicit in the 1931 Act. Without that condition the Act would have had no application whatsoever at the time of its passage, for at that time every \"alien\" was a national of another country who had \"entered\" here. While the Philippine Independence Act later made Filipinos \"aliens,\" that class of \"aliens\" who were resident here at the time never made an \"entry\" into this country. As Barber v. Gonzales, \n347 \nU.S. 637\n, holds, they were nationals to whom the concept of \"entry\" was inapplicable.\n\nSecond. The 1931 Act provides that the offending alien shall be deported \"in [the] manner\" provided in 19 and 20 of the 1917 Act, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 155, 156. The words \"in [the] manner\" are said to refer to the means for securing deportation which, by 19 (a) of the 1917 Act, are described as \"upon the warrant of the Attorney General.\" Bugajewitz v. Adams, \n228 \nU.S. 585, 591\n, construed the language of an earlier deportation Act in that way. It held that \"in the manner provided\" in that Act meant \"the means for securing deportation.\" Yet it is difficult for me to say that by that ruling \"in the manner\" became words of art in legislative drafting. The Bugajewitz case involved a statute with a very special legislative history. The words \"in the manner provided\" had been substituted for \"as provided.\" So it was apparent that Congress by the amendment had narrowed the meaning. There is no such special legislative history here. The words \"in the manner\" seem to me to be synonymous in this setting with \"as provided\" or \"under the conditions of.\" And the condition of the 1917 Act most relevant here is a crime committed \"after entry.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 427, 435]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo matter how the case is viewed, the 1931 Act is applicable only to aliens who had made an \"entry\" in this country.\n\nThis Filipino came to the United States in 1930 and he has never left here. If the spirit of the 1931 Act is to be observed, he should not be lumped with all other \"aliens\" who made an \"entry.\" The Filipino alien, who came here while he was a national, stands in a class by himself and should remain there, until and unless Congress extends these harsh deportation measures to his class. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 427, 436]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRADOVICH v.

FOOTBALL LEAGUE(1957)\nNo. 94\nArgued: January 17, 1957Decided: February 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Alleging that respondents conspired to monopolize and control professional football in violation of the Sherman Act, petitioner sued them under 4 of the Clayton Act for treble damages and injunctive relief. He alleged, inter alia, that respondents schedule football games in various cities, including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles; that a part of the business from which they derive a significant portion of their gross receipts is the transmission of the games over radio and television into nearly every State of the Union; that a part of the conspiracy was to destroy a competitive league by boycotting it and its players; that each team uses a standard player contract which prohibits a player from signing with another club without the consent of the club holding his contract; that these contracts are enforced by agreement of the clubs to black-list any player violating them and to visit severe penalties on recalcitrant member clubs; that, by blacklisting petitioner, they prevented him from becoming a player-coach in an affiliated league and effectively prevented his employment in organized professional football in the United States; and that this damaged him in the sum of $35,000. Held:\n\n 1. The rule established in Federal Baseball Club v. National League, \n259 \nU.S. 200\n, and Toolson v.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis action for treble damages and injunctive relief, brought under 4 of the Clayton Act,\n1\n tests the application of the antitrust laws to the business of professional football. Petitioner Radovich, an all-pro guard formerly with the Detroit Lions, contends that the respondents\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 447]\n\u00a0\n entered into a conspiracy to monopolize and control organized professional football in the United States, in violation of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act;\n3\n that part of the conspiracy was to destroy the All-America Conference, a competitive professional football league in which Radovich once played; and that pursuant to agreement, respondents boycotted Radovich and prevented him from becoming a player-coach in the Pacific Coast League. Petitioner alleges that respondents' illegal conduct damaged him in the sum of $35,000, to be trebled as provided by the Act. The trial court, on respondents' motion, dismissed the cause for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 231 F.2d 620, on the basis of Federal Baseball Club v. National League, \n259 \nU.S. 200\n (1922), and Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., \n346 \nU.S. 356\n (1953), applying the baseball rule to all \"team sports.\" It further found that even if such application was erroneous and that United States v. International Boxing Club, \n348 \nU.S. 236\n (1955), applied, Radovich had not grounded his claim on conduct of respondents which was \"calculated to prejudice the public or unreasonably restrain interstate commerce.\" 231 F.2d, at 623. We granted certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 818\n, in order to clarify the application of the Toolson doctrine and determine whether the business of football comes within the scope of the Sherman Act. For the reasons hereafter stated we conclude that Toolson and Federal Baseball do not control; \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n that the respondents' activities as alleged are within the coverage of the antitrust laws; and that the complaint states a cause of action thereunder.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nSince the complaint was dismissed its allegations must be taken by us as true. It is, therefore, important for us to consider what Radovich alleged. Concisely the complaint states that:\n\n1. Radovich began his professional football career in 1938 when he signed with the Detroit Lions, a National League club. After four seasons of play he entered the Navy, returning to the Lions for the 1945 season. In 1946 he asked for a transfer to a National League club in Los Angeles because of the illness of his father. The Lions refused the transfer and Radovich broke his player contract by signing with and playing the 1946 and 1947 seasons for the Los Angeles Dons, a member of the All-America Conference.\n4\n In 1948 the San Francisco Clippers, a member of the Pacific Coast League which was affiliated with but not a competitor of the National League, offered to employ Radovich as a player-coach. However, the National League advised that Radovich was black-listed and any affiliated club signing him would suffer severe penalties. The Clippers then refused to sign him in any position. This black-listing effectively prevented his employment in organized professional football in the United States.\n\n2. The black-listing was the result of a conspiracy among the respondents to monopolize commerce in professional football among the States. The purpose of the conspiracy was to \"control, regulate and dictate the terms upon which organized professional football shall be played throughout the United States\" in violation of 1 and 2 of the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 449]\n\u00a0\n Sherman Act. It was part of the conspiracy to boycott the All-America Conference and its players with a view to its destruction and thus strengthen the monopolistic position of the National Football League.\n\n3. As part of its football business, the respondent league and its member teams schedule football games in various metropolitan centers, including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. Each team uses a standard player contract which prohibits a player from signing with another club without the consent of the club holding the player's contract. These contracts are enforced by agreement of the clubs to black-list any player violating them and to visit severe penalties on recalcitrant member clubs. As a further \"part of the business of professional football itself\" and \"directly tied in and connected\" with its football exhibitions is the transmission of the games over radio and television into nearly every State of the Union. This is accomplished by contracts which produce a \"significant portion of the gross receipts\" and without which \"the business of operating a professional football club would not be profitable.\" The playing of the exhibitions themselves \"is essential to the interstate transmission by broadcasting and television\" and the actions of the respondents against Radovich were necessarily related to these interstate activities.\n\nIn the light of these allegations respondents raise two issues: They say the business of organized professional football was not intended by Congress to be included within the scope of the antitrust laws; and, if wrong in this contention, that the complaint does not state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nRespondents' contention, boiled down, is that agreements similar to those complained of here, which have for many years been used in organized baseball, have \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 450]\n\u00a0\n been held by this Court to be outside the scope of the antitrust laws.\n5\n They point to Federal Baseball and Toolson, supra, both involving the business of professional baseball, asserting that professional football has embraced the same techniques which existed in baseball at the time of the former decision.\n6\n They contend that stare decisis compels the same result here. True, the umbrella under which respondents hope to stand is not so large as that contended for in United States v. International Boxing Club, supra, nor in United States v. Shubert, \n348 \nU.S. 222\n (1955). There we were asked to extend Federal Baseball to boxing and the theater. Here respondents say that the contracts and sanctions which baseball and football find it necessary to impose have no counterpart in other businesses and that, therefore, they alone are outside the ambit of the Sherman Act. In Toolson we continued to hold the umbrella over baseball that was placed there some 31 years earlier by Federal Baseball. The Court did this because it was concluded that more harm would be done in overruling Federal Baseball than in upholding a ruling which at best was of dubious validity. Vast efforts had gone into the development and organization of baseball since that decision and enormous capital had been invested in reliance on its permanence. Congress had chosen to make no change.\n7\n All this, combined with the flood of litigation that would follow its repudiation, the harassment \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 451]\n\u00a0\n that would ensue, and the retroactive effect of such a decision, led the Court to the practical result that it should sustain the unequivocal line of authority reaching over many years.\n\nThe Court was careful to restrict Toolson's coverage to baseball, following the judgment of Federal Baseball only so far as it \"determines that Congress had no intention of including the business of baseball within the scope of the federal antitrust laws.\" \n346 \nU.S., at 357\n. The Court reiterated this in United States v. Shubert, supra, at 230, where it said, \"In short, Toolson was a narrow application of the rule of stare decisis.\" And again, in International Boxing Club, it added, \"Toolson neither overruled Federal Baseball nor necessarily reaffirmed all that was said in Federal Baseball. . . . Toolson is not authority for exempting other business merely because of the circumstance that they are also based on the performance of local exhibitions.\" \n348 \nU.S., at 242\n. Furthermore, in discussing the impact of the Federal Baseball decision, the Court made the observation that that decision \"could not be relied upon as a basis of exemption for other segments of the entertainment business, athletic or otherwise. . . . The controlling consideration in Federal Baseball . . . was . . . the degree of interstate activity involved in the particular business under review.\" Id., at 242-243. It seems that this language would have made it clear that the Court intended to isolate these cases by limiting them to baseball, but since Toolson and Federal Baseball are still cited as controlling authority in antitrust actions involving other fields of business, we now specifically limit the rule there established to the facts there involved, i. e., the business of organized professional baseball. As long as the Congress continues to acquiesce we should adhere to - but not extend - the interpretation of the Act made in those cases. We did not extend them to boxing or the theater because we believed \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 452]\n\u00a0\n that the volume of interstate business in each - the rationale of Federal Baseball - was such that both activities were within the Act. Likewise, the volume of interstate business involved in organized professional football places it within the provisions of the Act.\n\nIf this ruling is unrealistic, inconsistent, or illogical, it is sufficient to answer, aside from the distinctions between the businesses,\n8\n that were we considering the question of baseball for the first time upon a clean slate we would have no doubts. But Federal Baseball held the business of baseball outside the scope of the Act. No other business claiming the coverage of those cases has such an adjudication. We, therefore, conclude that the orderly way to eliminate error or discrimination, if any there be, is by legislation and not by court decision. Congressional processes are more accommodative, affording the whole industry hearings and an opportunity to assist in the formulation of new legislation. The resulting product is therefore more likely to protect the industry and the public alike. The whole scope of congressional action would be known long in advance and effective dates for the legislation could be set in the future without the injustices of retroactivity and surprise which might follow court action. Of course, the doctrine of Toolson and Federal Baseball must yield to any congressional action and continues only at its sufferance. This is not a new approach. See Davis v. Department of Labor, \n317 \nU.S. 249, 255\n (1942);\n9\n Compare Rutkin v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 130\n (1952). \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 453]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nWe now turn to the sufficiency of the complaint. At the outset the allegations of the nature and extent of interstate commerce seem to be sufficient. In addition to the standard allegations, a specific claim is made that radio and television transmission is a significant, integral part of the respondents' business, even to the extent of being the difference between a profit and a loss. Unlike International Boxing, the complaint alleges no definite percentage in this regard. However, the amount must be substantial and can easily be brought out in the proof. If substantial, as alleged, it alone is sufficient to meet the commerce requirements of the Act. See International Boxing, supra, at 241.\n\nLikewise, we find the technical objections to the pleading without merit. The test as to sufficiency laid down by Mr. Justice Holmes in Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange, \n262 \nU.S. 271, 274\n (1923), is whether \"the claim is wholly frivolous.\" While the complaint might have been more precise in its allegations concerning the purpose and effect of the conspiracy, \"we are not prepared to say that nothing can be extracted from this bill that falls under the act of Congress . . . .\" Id., at 274. See also United States v. Employing Plasterers Assn., \n347 \nU.S. 186\n (1954).\n\nPetitioner's claim need only be \"tested under the Sherman Act's general prohibition on unreasonable restraints of trade,\" Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594, 614\n (1953), and meet the requirement that petitioner has thereby suffered injury. Congress has, by legislative fiat, determined that such prohibited activities are injurious to the public\n10\n and has \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 454]\n\u00a0\n provided sanctions allowing private enforcement of the antitrust laws by an aggrieved party. These laws protect the victims of the forbidden practices as well as the public. Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., \n334 \nU.S. 219, 236\n (1948). Furthermore, Congress itself has placed the private antitrust litigant in a most favorable position through the enactment of 5 of the Clayton Act.\n11\n Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp., \n340 \nU.S. 558\n (1951). In the face of such a policy this Court should not add requirements to burden the private litigant beyond what is specifically set forth by Congress in those laws.\n\nRespondents' remaining contentions we believe to be lacking in merit.\n\nWe think that Radovich is entitled to an opportunity to prove his charges. Of course, we express no opinion as to whether or not respondents have, in fact, violated the antitrust laws, leaving that determination to the trial court after all the facts are in.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. 15, reads as follows:\n\n\"SEC. 4.

In 1951 four separate bills were introduced to exempt organized professional sports from the antitrust laws. None of them were enacted. See H.R. 4229, 4230, 4231, and S. 1526, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. (1951).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Consideration of basic differences, if any, between the baseball and football businesses, such as the football draft system, use of league affiliations, training facilities and techniques, etc., is not necessary to this decision.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The concurring opinion uses this language: \"Such a desirable end cannot now be achieved merely by judicial repudiation of the Jensen doctrine.\" \n317 \nU.S., at 259\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469\n (1940), this Court said: \"The end sought was the prevention of restraints to free competition \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 454]\n\u00a0\n in business and commercial transactions which tended to restrict production, raise prices or otherwise control the market to the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services, all of which had come to be regarded as a special form of public injury.\" (Emphasis supplied.)

United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n (1912), speaking of the antitrust laws, the Court said: \"The law is its own measure of right and wrong, of what it permits, or forbids, and the judgment of the courts cannot be set up against it in a supposed accommodation of its policy with the good intention of parties, and it may be, of some good results.\" (Emphasis supplied.) Id., at 49.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. 16, declares that a final judgment against a defendant in proceedings by the Government for violation of the antitrust laws may be introduced by a private litigant in a subsequent treble damage action and establishes prima facie a violation of the antitrust laws. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n\nThe difficult problem in this case derives for me not out of the Sherman Law but in relation to the appropriate compulsion of stare decisis. It does not derive from the Sherman Law because the most conscientious probing of the text and the interstices of the Sherman Law fails to disclose that Congress, whose will we are enforcing, excluded baseball - the conditions under which that sport is carried on - from the scope of the Sherman Law but included football. I say this, fully aware that the Sherman Law's applicability turns on the particular circumstances of activities pursued in trade and commerce among the several States. But whether the conduct of an enterprise is within or without the limits of the Sherman Law is, after all, a question for judicial determination, and conscious as I am of my limited competence in matters athletic, I have yet to hear of any consideration that led this Court to hold that \"the business of providing public baseball games for profit between clubs of professional baseball players was not within the scope of the federal antitrust laws,\" Toolson v. New York Yankees, \n346 \nU.S. 356, 357\n, that is not equally applicable to football.\n\nBut considerations pertaining to stare decisis do raise a serious question for me. That principle is a vital ingredient of law, for it \"embodies an important social policy.\" Helvering v. Hallock, \n309 \nU.S. 106, 119\n. It would disregard the principle for a judge stubbornly to persist in his views on a particular issue after the contrary had become part of the tissue of the law. Until then, full respect for stare decisis does not require a judge to forego his own convictions promptly after his brethren have rejected them.\n\nThe considerations that governed me two years ago in United States v. International Boxing Club, \n348 \nU.S. 236\n, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 456]\n\u00a0\n have not lost their force by reason of the authority that time gives to a single decision. And so I am confronted with the Toolson case, supra, which guides me to find the present situation within its scope, and the Boxing case, supra, which, while it looks the other way, left Toolson as a living authority. Respect for the doctrine of stare decisis does not yet require me to disrespect the views I expressed in the Boxing case.\n\nI would affirm.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.\n\nWhat was foreshadowed by United States v. International Boxing Club, \n348 \nU.S. 236\n, has now come to pass. The Court, in holding that professional football is subject to the antitrust laws, now says in effect that professional baseball is sui generis so far as those laws are concerned, and that therefore Federal Baseball Club v. National League, \n259 \nU.S. 200\n, and Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., \n346 \nU.S. 356\n, do not control football by reason of stare decisis. Since I am unable to distinguish football from baseball under the rationale of Federal Baseball and Toolson, and can find no basis for attributing to Congress a purpose to put baseball in a class by itself, I would adhere to the rule of stare decisis and affirm the judgment below.\n\nIf the situation resulting from the baseball decisions is to be changed. I think it far better to leave it to be dealt with by Congress than for this Court to becloud the situation further, either by making untenable distinctions between baseball and other professional sports, or by discriminatory fiat in favor of baseball. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 445, 457]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAILWAY EXPRESS AGENCY, INC., v.

Pp. 107-111.\n\n 236 F.2d 514, affirmed.\n\nThomas K. Hudson argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nJohn F. Davis argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney and Beatrice Rosenberg.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case concerns the issue of whether the contents of a communication overheard on a regularly used telephone extension with the consent of one party to the conversation are admissible in federal court.\n1\n Petitioner was convicted of violations of 18 U.S.C. 875 (b) and (c) \n\n[355 \nU.S. 107, 108]\n\u00a0\n for transmitting an interstate communication which threatened the life of one Sparks in order to obtain from him a stock certificate which Sparks held as collateral for a loan. On March 16, 1955, petitioner, who was in New York, spoke by telephone with Sparks, who was in Pueblo, Colorado. Anticipating another call from petitioner, Sparks requested that members of the Pueblo police force overhear the conversation. When petitioner phoned Sparks in the early morning of March 17, two police officers at Sparks' direction listened to the conversation on a telephone extension in another room of the Sparks home. This extension had not been installed there just for this purpose but was a regular connection, previously placed and normally used. At the trial the police officers testified over timely objection that during this conversation petitioner had threatened Sparks' life because he would not surrender the certificate. Petitioner was convicted and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 236 F.2d 514. We granted certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 965\n.\n\nBenanti v. United States, ante, p. 96, determined that information obtained and divulged by state agents in violation of Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act\n2\n is inadmissible in federal court. The pertinent portion of Section 605 states:\n\n\". . . no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person . . . .\"\n\n\n Since there was a divulgence of the contents of a communication, the only issue on the facts before us is whether there has been an unauthorized interception within the meaning of Section 605.\n3\n The federal courts have split in \n\n[355 \nU.S. 107, 109]\n\u00a0\n their determination of this question. Some courts have held that the statute proscribes the use of an extension telephone to allow someone to overhear a conversation without the consent of both parties.\n4\n Others have concluded that the statute is inapplicable where one party has consented.\n5\n We hold that Section 605 was not violated in the case before us because there has been no \"interception\" as Congress intended that the word be used. Every statute must be interpreted in the light of reason and common understanding to reach the results intended by the legislature. Cf. Holy Trinity Church v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457\n; American Security & Trust Co. v. Commissioners, \n224 \nU.S. 491\n. That principle would be violated if we attributed to Congress acceptance of the results that would occur here from the position argued by petitioner.\n\nThe telephone extension is a widely used instrument of home and office,\n6\n yet with nothing to evidence congressional intent, petitioner argues that Congress meant to \n\n[355 \nU.S. 107, 110]\n\u00a0\n place a severe restriction on its ordinary use by subscribers, denying them the right to allow a family member, an employee, a trusted friend, or even the police to listen to a conversation to which a subscriber is a party. Section 605 points to the opposite conclusion. Immediately following the portion quoted above, the statute continues:\n\n\". . . no person not being entitled thereto shall receive or assist in receiving any interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio and use the same or any information therein contained for his own benefit or for the benefit of another not entitled thereto . . . .\"\n\n\n The clear inference is that one entitled to receive the communication may use it for his own benefit or have another use it for him. The communication itself is not privileged, and one party may not force the other to secrecy merely by using a telephone. It has been conceded by those who believe the conduct here violates Section 605 that either party may record the conversation and publish it.\n7\n The conduct of the party would differ in no way if instead of repeating the message he held out \n\n[355 \nU.S. 107, 111]\n\u00a0\n his handset so that another could hear out of it. We see no distinction between that sort of action and permitting an outsider to use an extension telephone for the same purpose.\n\nThe error in accepting petitioner's argument is brought into sharper focus by the fact that Section 605 is penal in nature, the first violation being punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both.\n8\n For example, it follows from petitioner's argument that every secretary who listens to a business conversation at her employer's direction in order to record it would be marked as a potential federal criminal. It is unreasonable to believe that Congress meant to extend criminal liability to conduct which is wholly innocent and ordinary.\n\nCommon experience tells us that a call to a particular telephone number may cause the bell to ring in more than one ordinarily used instrument. Each party to a telephone conversation takes the risk that the other party may have an extension telephone and may allow another to overhear the conversation. When such takes place there has been no violation of any privacy of which the parties may complain. Consequently, one element of Section 605, interception, has not occurred.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The grant of certiorari was limited to the following question, as phrased by petitioner: \"Is the listening in of third parties on an extension telephone in an adjoining room, without consent of the sender, an interception of a telephone message, and the divulgence of the contents of such conversation prohibited by statute, to wit Sec. 605, Title 47, U.S.C.A.\" Implicit in this phrasing of the question is the fact that one party to the conversation did consent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 48 Stat. 1103, 47 U.S.C. 605.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] We do not decide the question of whether 605 is violated where a message is intercepted but not divulged since the police officers did \n\n[355 \nU.S. 107, 109]\n\u00a0\n divulge the contents of the overheard conversation when they testified in court.

Additional violations are punishable by the same fine and not more than two years' imprisonment, or both.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.\n\nAlthough this Court had, in Olmstead v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 438\n, decided that neither the Fourth Amendment nor the general judicial principles governing criminal trials in United States courts barred evidence \n\n[355 \nU.S. 107, 112]\n\u00a0\n obtained through interception of telephone communications by law-enforcing officers without the consent of the sender, the Congress a few years later provided that\n\n\"no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person . . . .\" 605, Federal Communications Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 1104, 47 U.S.C. 605.\n\n\n If the judicial attitude that lies behind the phrase \"strict construction of a statute,\" i. e., in favor of an accused, can have an emphatic illustration, it is found in the two Nardone cases, in which the quoted provision of 605 was first given effect by this Court. We there held that the implications of that section bar even the most relevant and persuasive evidence obtained, without a sender's authorization, through interception by law officers, and likewise bar independently secured evidence obtained as a result of leads afforded by such interception. Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379\n; \n308 \nU.S. 338\n. The whole point of the vigorous dissent in the first Nardone case was directed against literal application of the phrase \"no person\" thereby \"enabling the most depraved criminals to further their criminal plans over the telephone, in the secure knowledge that even if these plans involve kidnapping and murder, their telephone conversations can never be intercepted by officers of the law and revealed in court.\" Mr. Justice Sutherland, dissenting in Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S., at 385\n. The Court's opinion gave a short and decisive answer: \"We nevertheless face the fact that the plain words of 605 forbid anyone, unless authorized by the sender, to intercept a telephone message, and direct in equally clear language that `no person' shall divulge or publish the message or its substance to `any person.'\" \n302 \nU.S., at 382\n. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 107, 113]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn this case, petitioner's conviction was based on the testimony of a police officer who listened in on a telephone communication made by petitioner, and such listening-in was not \"authorized by the sender,\" to wit, the petitioner. It is suggested that the interception, for such it was, in the clear meaning of the term for carrying out its function - an intrusion by way of listening to the legally insulated transmission of thought between a speaker and a hearer - does not fall within the prohibition of 605, because it was carried out by means of \"a regularly used telephone extension with the consent of one party.\" But, surely, the availability of a \"regularly used telephone extension\" does not make 605 inoperative. The fact that the Court relies on \"the consent of one party\" evidently implies that it would not be without the purview of 605 for a police officer to conceal himself in a room of a house or a suite of offices having several \"regularly used telephone extensions\" and surreptitiously to utilize such an extension to overhear telephone conversations.\n\nIt is said that the overhearing in this case was \"with the consent of one party.\" But the statute is not satisfied with \"the consent of one party.\" The statute says \"no person not being authorized by the sender.\" Since this Court, in Nardone, read \"no person\" to mean no person, it is even more incumbent to construe \"sender\" to mean sender, as was the petitioner here, and not to read \"sender\" to mean one of the parties to the communication, whether sender or receiver. It is further suggested that Congress must have been aware of the wide use of telephone extensions and the practice of listening-in on extensions. In the first Nardone case this Court rejected the argument that Congress had knowledge of the employment of federal agents \"to tap wires in aid of detection and conviction of criminals.\" \n302 \nU.S., at 381\n. But the Court refused to qualify the rigorous policy of Congress as expressed by its enactment. And today, in Benanti v. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 107, 114]\n\u00a0\n United States, the Court rejects, and if I may say so rightly, the plausible contention that the well-known legislative authorization of wire-tapping by some of the States ought to be deemed to have qualified the strict purpose of Congress.\n\nIt is suggested, however, that it is one of the accepted modes of carrying on business in our time to have secretaries listen in on conversations by their principals. A secretary may fairly be called the employer's alter ego. And so, a secretary is fairly to be deemed as much of an automatic instrument in the context of our problem as a tape recorder. Surely a police officer called in to facilitate the detection of crime is not such an alter ego. His participation in telephone communications when not authorized by the sender occupies precisely the same position that it occupied in the Olmstead case when this Court sanctioned the practice, and in the Nardone cases where this Court rigorously enforced the prohibition by Congress of what theretofore was a lawful practice.\n\nSharing the views expressed by Judge Learned Hand in United States v.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn both of these cases petitioners brought suit in the United States District Court in the State of Washington seeking to recover damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act. 28 U.S.C. 1346 (b) and 2671-2680, for losses which they allege were caused by the negligence of employees of the United States in allowing a forest fire to be started on Government land and in failing to act with due care to put this fire out. The complaints in the two \n\n[352 \nU.S. 315, 316]\n\u00a0\n cases are substantially the same and in summary make the following allegations. The United States owned certain land in the State of Washington. It permitted a railroad to run trains over a right of way passing through this land. On August 6, 1951, sparks from a railroad engine ignited six fires on the right of way and adjoining land. These fires started in areas where highly inflammable dry grasses, brush, and other materials had been negligently allowed to accumulate by the Government. Shortly after the fires started United States Forest Service personnel appeared and took exclusive direction and control of all fire suppression activities. The Forest Service had entered into an agreement with the State of Washington to protect against and to suppress any fires in an area which included the public lands where these fires started and the petitioners' lands. Petitioners were aware of this contract and relied on the Forest Service to control and put out the fires involved in this case. But as a result of the Forest Service's improper firefighting these fires spread until they became a single fire covering 1,600 acres. By August 11, however, this blaze was under control and was substantially out except for certain spots that continued to burn and smolder until September 20. During the period between August 11 and September 20 there were men, equipment and a plentiful supply of water available to the Forest Service and if these resources had been properly utilized the fire could have been completely extinguished. For several days immediately preceding September 20 there was decreasing humidity accompanied by strong winds. But the Forest Service kept only a few men guarding the fire despite the fact that it was smoldering close to a tinder-dry accumulation of debris, down logs and dead undergrowth. On September 20 the winds blew sparks from the smoldering embers into these inflammable materials and the fire exploded spreading as much as twenty miles in one direction. As it fanned \n\n[352 \nU.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n out it destroyed timber, buildings and other property some of which belonged to the petitioners.\n\nThe complaints allege that these consequences were caused by the Forest Service's negligence (1) in permitting inflammable materials to accumulate on Government land thereby allowing the fires to start and to spread; (2) in not preventing the railroad from starting the original spot fires; (3) in not properly suppressing the spot fires; and (4) in failing to quench and prevent the spread of the fire when it was under control in the 1,600 acre area. The district judge dismissed the complaints holding that they failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. He indicated that the facts alleged were sufficient to show actionable negligence on the part of a private person under the laws of Washington, but nevertheless felt compelled to dismiss the complaints because of the following statements by this Court in Dalehite v. United States, \n346 \nU.S. 15, 43\n.\n\n \"As to the alleged failure in fighting the fire, we think this too without the [Tort Claims] Act. The Act did not create new causes of action where none existed before. . . . `Its effect is to waive immunity from recognized causes of action and was not to visit the Government with novel and unprecedented liabilities.'. . . It did not change the normal rule that an alleged failure or carelessness of public firemen does not create private actionable rights.\"\n\n\n The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial judge's disposal of the complaints. 225 F.2d 642 and 225 F.2d 650. In agreeing that the United States could not be sued for any carelessness by the Forest Service in fighting the fire, it also relied exclusively on the Dalehite case. It rejected petitioners' other claims of negligence on the ground that Washington law would impose no liability for the misconduct alleged. We hold that the courts below erred in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 315, 318]\n\u00a0\n deciding that the United States was immune from liability for any negligence by the Forest Service in fighting the fire.\n\nThe Tort Claims Act makes the United States liable (with certain exceptions which are not relevant here) for the negligence of its employees\n\n\". . . in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances . . . .\" 28 U.S.C. 2674.\n\n\n It gives the District Courts jurisdiction of all claims against the Government for losses\n\n\". . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\" 28 U.S.C. 1346 (b).\n\n\n These provisions, given their plain natural meaning, make the United States liable to petitioners for the Forest Service's negligence in fighting the forest fire if, as alleged in the complaints, Washington law would impose liability on private persons or corporations under similar circumstances.\n\nNevertheless the Government, relying primarily on the Dalehite case, contends that Congress by the Tort Claims Act did not waive the United States' immunity from liability for the negligence of its employees when they act as public firemen. It argues that the Act only imposes liability on the United States under circumstances where governmental bodies have traditionally been responsible for the misconduct of their employees and that neither the common law nor the law of Washington imposes liability on municipal or other local governments for the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 315, 319]\n\u00a0\n negligence of their agents acting in the \"uniquely governmental\" capacity of public firemen. But as we recently held in Indian Towing Co. v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 61\n, the test established by the Tort Claims Act for determining the United States' liability is whether a private person would be responsible for similar negligence under the laws of the State where the acts occurred. We expressly decided in Indian Towing that the United States' liability is not restricted to the liability of a municipal corporation or other public body and that an injured party cannot be deprived of his rights under the Act by resort to an alleged distinction, imported from the law of municipal corporations, between the Government's negligence when it acts in a \"proprietary\" capacity and its negligence when it acts in a \"uniquely governmental\" capacity.\n1\n To the extent that there was anything to the contrary in the Dalehite case it was necessarily rejected by Indian Towing.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nIt may be that it is \"novel and unprecedented\" to hold the United States accountable for the negligence of its firefighters, but the very purpose of the Tort Claims Act was to waive the Government's traditional all-encompassing immunity from tort actions and to establish novel and unprecedented governmental liability. The Government warns that if it is held responsible for the negligence of Forest Service firemen a heavy burden may be imposed on the public treasury. It points out the possibility that a fire may destroy hundreds of square miles of forests and even burn entire communities. But after long consideration. Congress, believing it to be in the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 315, 320]\n\u00a0\n best interest of the nation, saw fit to impose such liability on the United States in the Tort Claims Act. Congress was aware that when losses caused by such negligence are charged against the public treasury they are in effect spread among all those who contribute financially to the support of the Government and the resulting burden on each taxpayer is relatively slight. But when the entire burden falls on the injured party it may leave him destitute or grievously harmed. Congress could, and apparently did, decide that this would be unfair when the public as a whole benefits from the services performed by Government employees. And for obvious reasons the United States cannot be equated with a municipality, which conceivably might be rendered bankrupt if it were subject to liability for the negligence of its firemen. There is no justification for this Court to read exemptions into the Act beyond those provided by Congress.\n3\n If the Act is to be altered that is a function for the same body that adopted it.\n\nThe record shows that the trial judge dismissed both complaints in their entirety solely on the basis of the Dalehite case. While the Court of Appeals relied on state law to uphold the dismissal of those allegations in the complaints which charged negligence for reasons other than the Forest Service's carelessness in controlling the fire, we cannot say that court's interpretation of Washington law was wholly free from its erroneous acceptance of the statements in Dalehite about public firemen. Furthermore it has been strongly contended here that the Court of Appeals improperly interpreted certain allegations in the complaints and as a result of such misinterpretation incorrectly applied Washington law in passing on the sufficiency of these allegations. In view \n\n[352 \nU.S. 315, 321]\n\u00a0\n of the circumstances, we think it proper to vacate both judgments in their entirety so that the District Court may consider the complaints anew, in their present form or as they may be amended, wholly free to determine their sufficiency on the basis of whether the allegations and any supporting material offered to explain or clarify them would be sufficient to impose liability on a private person under the laws of the State of Washington.\n4\n The judgments of both courts are vacated and the cases are remanded to the District Court for consideration in accordance with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] And see United States v.

United States, \n346 \nU.S. 15, 43\n. Private organizations, except as community volunteers, for fire fighting were hardly known. The situation was like private military forces. Cf. Feres v.

Rector, for respondent.\n\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n  The petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded. The trial judge set aside the jury verdict for the petitioner because, inter alia, it was held that the respondent 'had no duty to anticipate that a car was being used for such a purpose.' There was evidence, however, as the trial court found, that to respondent's knowledge employees used gondola cars for the purpose. In that circumstance there were probative facts from which the jury could find that respondent was or should have been aware of conditions which created a likelihood that the petitioner would suffer just such an injury as he did. Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500\nd 493; cf. Wilkerson v. McCarthy, \n336 \nU.S. 53\n.\n  Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER is of the opinion that the writ of certiorari should not be granted. Since the writ has been granted, he would dismiss it as improvidently granted for the reasons set forth in his opinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500, 524\n, 459.\n\n\n Mr. Justice CLARK, dissenting.\n  As Mr. Justice Douglas said in Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 1949, \n336 \nU.S. 53, 68\n, 420, 'The liability which (the FELA) imposed was the liability for negligence.' Believing that the Congress was looking to the courts to \n\n[354 \nU.S. 901\n, 902]\n\u00a0\n see that the railroads were held to strict accountability under the Federal Employers' Liability Act1 for any negligence whatever resulting in injury to an employee, the Court has taken cases that in ordinary course it would have denied as involving only particular facts rather than questions 'of importance to the public,' Layne & Bowler Corp. v. Western Well Works, Inc., 1923, \n261 \nU.S. 387, 393\n, 423. As in the seamen's Jones Act2 cases, the Court feels a duty under this Federal Act to examine each case to make certain that its mandate is honored. \n3\n There has been no breach in this policy since its establishment soon after the amendment of the Act in 1936. In my opinion, however, the judgment today goes beyond the most generous interpretation that may be given to the Act. The petitioner suffered the grevious injury which resulted in the loss of a leg while using, as a toilet, one of the railroad's cars standing on a switch track. While petitioner was 'answering his call of nature' in the car, it moved slightly from a contact with two other cars that were being switched. This contact caused some steel plates in the car to shift, crushing petitioner's right leg.\n  The Court does not find a failure on the part of the railroad to provide a safe place for the petitioner to work insofar as toilet facilities are concerned. The railroad thus is not found negligent in this respect. But the Court seizes upon a statement in the trial judge's memorandum that 'There is evidence that employees sometimes used gondola cars in lieu of toilets. The Court must assume \n\n[354 \nU.S. 901\n, 903]\n\u00a0\n that this was known to the defendant.' The trial judge found, however, that the railroad could not anticipate that this particular gondola car would be used for that purpose because it was loaded with freight-steel plates-and was standing on a track that was being used for normal switching operations. The judge points out that petitioner himself thought that the car was empty when he climbed into it. If the car had not been loaded the petitioner would not have suffered the injury which resulted. For these reasons the trial judge found that the railroad could not anticipate that its employee would so use a loaded car or that the resultant injury would occur. In addition, the petitioner had admitted that he 'certainly (did) not feel that the yard crew was careless in any manner .... This was a very easy impact and the two standing cars did not move over a foot at the most.'\n  In the light of such a record it appears to me that negligence could not be imputed to the railroad. Of course, if the majority is saying that the railroad must inspect every loaded car awaiting switching, lest an employee be using it as a toilet, then I could easily understand the action here. But this it does not say, for it would be not only an unrealistic but an untenable burden to place on the railroad. The court cites two cases, neither of which appears to me to be apposite. In Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 1957, \n352 \nU.S. 500, 502\n, 446, 'petitioner was supplied with a crude hand torch and was instructed to burn off the weeds and vegetation along (the railroad's track).' The mishap occurred while he was performing these services. There was a 'likelihood that petitioner ... would suffer just such an injury as he did.' Id., 352 U.S. at page 504, 77 S.Ct. at page 447. In Wilkerson v. McCarthy, supra, the railroad had constructed a pit in its yards for the repair of car wheels. It was 40 feet long, 11 feet deep, and over 4 feet wide and was under a series of 3 or more railroad tracks. A permanent board about 22 inches wide was constructed \n\n[354 \nU.S. 901\n, 904]\n\u00a0\n across the pit and was used by the employees of the railroad to walk across it. While there was a chain placed around a portion of the pit it was not sufficient to stop employees from using the board for crossing purposes. An employee slipped on the board which was greasy and oily and was injured by a fall to the bottom of the pit. There was thus a very hazardous practice which, a jury might find, the railroad took inadequate precautions to prohibit. The railroad was held responsible. The practice here may be unsanitary, but it is not foreseeably hazardous. This accident resulted from a combination of freak circumstances rather than from actionable negligence.\n  While I was not on the Court when Wilkerson was decided, I fully agree with its holding and likewise adhere to my joining the Court in the Rogers case. The factual situations in those cases are far removed from the facts here. In my opinion the decision today extends the doctrine of these cases far beyond any theory of liability for negligence that the Congress intended under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.\n\n Mr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice WHITTAKER joins, dissenting.\n  The facts of this case, as summarized by District Judge Cecil, are these:\n'On October 7, 1950, Boyd R. Ringhiser, the plaintiff herein, arose in the afternoon, made preparation to report for duty at 4:45 p.m., had a bowel movement, made a mental calculation and thereby set in motion a chain of events which created a result both unusual and tragic.\n\n'The sequence of these events is as follows: The plaintiff's bowel movement was unsatisfactory; 'This won't do,' said he to himself ( statement made by plaintiff at trial, but ordered stricken); he took a \n\n[354 \nU.S. 901\n, 905]\n\u00a0\n  dose of salts and washed it down with sweet cider; he got in his car and drove to Parson's Yard, the switching yard of the defendant, and had a bowel movement at the roundhouse. He then got on his engine and maneuvered it to track twelve, where it was coupled on to a train scheduled for Walbridge Yard at Toledo. While sitting in his engine waiting for his air brake test, he had an urgent call of nature and 'had to go quick.' He dismounted from his locomotive cab to go to a toilet a short distance west. A long train of empties passed between him and the object of his immediate attention. He could not wait for this train to pass and went to No. 8 switch track and climbed into a lowsided gondola car to answer his call of nature. While thus engaged, a yard crew switched two cars into No. 8 switch track. These cars came in contact with the car ahead of plaintiff's car and it likewise came in contact with plaintiff's car. The gondola car in which plaintiff had taken his position was loaded with steel plates and when the cars made contact the plates shifted, caught plaintiff's right leg and crushed it so that a few days later, it had to be amputated.'\n\n  On these facts I do not think the accident was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of any act or omission of the railroad. I therefore dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C.  51 et seq., 45 U.S.C.A.  51 et seq.  \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C.  688, 46 U.S.C.A.  688.  \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Since the October Term 1949 there have been some 17 cases, including 8 this Term, involving the sufficiency of the evidence under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.

The State Supreme Court reversed upon the ground that petitioner's evidence did not support the finding of respondent's liability. This Court granted certiorari. Held: The evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding for petitioner, and the judgment is reversed. Pp. 501-511.\n\n 1. Under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the test of a jury case is whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the employee's injury.

Cognizant of the duty to effectuate the intention of the Congress to secure the right to a jury determination in cases under the Act, this Court is vigilant to exercise its power of review in any case where it appears that the litigants have been improperly deprived of that determination. P. 509.\n\n\n 3. The fact that Congress has not substituted a scheme of workmen's compensation cannot relieve this Court of its obligation to effectuate the existing Act by granting certiorari to correct improper administration of the Act and to prevent its erosion by narrow and niggardly construction.

Sommers argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Thomas T. Railey.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nA jury in the Circuit Court of St. Louis awarded damages to the petitioner in this action under the Federal Employer's Liability Act.\n1\n The Supreme Court of Missouri reversed upon the ground that the petitioner's evidence did not support the finding of respondent's liability.\n2\n This Court granted certiorari to consider the question whether the decision invaded the jury's function.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner was a laborer in a section gang, working on July 17, 1951, along a portion of respondent's double-track line which, near Garner, Arkansas, runs generally north and south. The tracks are on ballast topping the surface of a dirt \"dump\" with sloping sides, and there is a path about a yard wide bordering each side of the surface between the crest of the slope and the edge of the ballast. Weeds and vegetation, killed chemically preparatory to burning them off, covered the paths and slopes. Petitioner's foreman assigned him to burn off the weeds and vegetation - the first time he was given that task in the two months he had worked for the respondent. He testified that it was customary to burn off such vegetation with a flame thrower operated from a car running on the tracks. Railroad witnesses testified, however, that the respondent discontinued the use of flame throwers at least \n\n[352 \nU.S. 500, 502]\n\u00a0\n a year earlier because the fires started by them sometimes spread beyond the railroad right of way.\n\nPetitioner was supplied with a crude hand torch and was instructed to burn off the weeds and vegetation along the west path and for two or three feet down the west slope. The events leading to his mishap occurred after he proceeded with the work to a point within thirty to thirty-five yards of a culvert adjoining the path.\n\nPetitioner testified, without contradiction, that the foreman instructed him and other members of the section gang to stop what they were doing when a train passed and to take positions off the tracks and ties to observe the journals of the passing train for hotboxes. The instructions were explicit not to go on either of the tracks or to stand on or near the ends of the ties when a train was passing on a far track. This was a safety precaution because \"the sound of one train would deaden the sound of another one that possibly would come from the other way.\"\n\nOn this day petitioner heard the whistle of a train which was approaching from behind him on the east track. He promptly \"quit firing\" and ran north to a place on the path near the mentioned culvert. He was standing a few feet from the culvert observing the train for hotboxes when he became enveloped in smoke and flames. The passing train had fanned the flames of the burning vegetation and weeds, carrying the fire to the vegetation around his position. He threw his arm over his face, retreated quickly back on the culvert and slipped and fell from the top of the culvert, suffering the serious injuries for which he sought damages in this suit.\n\nThe complaint alleges negligence in that petitioner was \"required to work at a place in close proximity to defendant's railroad tracks, whereon trains moved and passed, causing the fire from said burning weeds and the smoke therefrom to come dangerously close to plaintiff and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 500, 503]\n\u00a0\n requiring plaintiff to move away from said danger.\" Negligence was also alleged in that the surface of the culvert was not properly maintained because, instead of the usual flat surface giving firm footing for workmen, the surface was \"covered with loose and sloping gravel which did not provide adequate or sufficient footing for plaintiff to thus move or work under the circumstances.\"\n\nWe think that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding for the petitioner. The testimony that the burning off of weeds and vegetation was ordinarily done with flame throwers from cars on the tracks and not, as here, by a workman on foot using a crude hand torch, when that evidence is considered with the uncontradicted testimony that the petitioner was where he was on this narrow path atop the dirt \"dump\" in furtherance of explicit orders to watch for hotboxes, supplied ample support for a jury finding that respondent's negligence played a part in the petitioner's injury. These were probative facts from which the jury could find that respondent was or should have been aware of conditions which created a likelihood that petitioner, in performing the duties required of him, would suffer just such an injury as he did.\n4\n Common experience teaches both that a passing train will fan the flames of a fire, and that a person suddenly enveloped in flames and smoke will instinctively react by retreating from the danger and in the process pay scant heed to other dangers which may imperil him. In this view, it was an irrelevant consideration whether the immediate reason for his slipping off the culvert was the presence of gravel negligently allowed by respondent to remain on the surface, or was some cause not identified from the evidence.\n\nThe Missouri Supreme Court based its reversal upon its finding of an alleged admission by the petitioner that \n\n[352 \nU.S. 500, 504]\n\u00a0\n he knew it was his primary duty to watch the fire. From that premise the Missouri court reasoned that petitioner was inattentive to the fire and that the emergency which confronted him \"was an emergency brought about by himself.\"\n5\n It said that if, as petitioner testified, the immediate cause of his fall was that loose gravel on the surface of the culvert rolled out from under him, yet it was his inattention to the fire which caused it to spread and obliged petitioner \"to move blindly away and fall,\" and this was \"something extraordinary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of the gravel at the culvert.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\nWe interpret the foregoing to mean that the Missouri court found as a matter of law that the petitioner's conduct was the sole cause of his mishap. But when the petitioner agreed that his primary duty was to watch the fire he did not also say that he was relieved of the duty to stop to watch a passing train for hotboxes. Indeed, no witness testified that the instruction was countermanded. At best, uncertainty as to the fact arises from the petitioner's testimony, and in that circumstance not the court, but the jury, was the tribunal to determine the fact.\n\nWe may assume that the jury could properly have reached the court's conclusion. But, as the probative facts also supported with reason the verdict favorable to the petitioner,\n7\n the decision was exclusively for the jury to make.\n8\n The jury was instructed to return a verdict for the respondent if it was found that negligence of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 500, 505]\n\u00a0\n the petitioner was the sole cause of his mishap.\n9\n We must take it that the verdict was obedient to the trial judge's charge and that the jury found that such was not the case but that petitioner's injury resulted at least in part from the respondent's negligence.\n\nThe opinion may also be read as basing the reversal on another ground, namely, that it appeared to the court that the petitioner's conduct was at least as probable a cause for his mishap as any negligence of the respondent, and that in such case there was no case for the jury. But that would mean that there is no jury question in actions under this statute, although the employee's proofs support \n\n[352 \nU.S. 500, 506]\n\u00a0\n with reason a verdict in his favor, unless the judge can say that the jury may exclude the idea that his injury was due to causes with which the defendant was not connected, or, stated another way, unless his proofs are so strong that the jury, on grounds of probability, may exclude a conclusion favorable to the defendant. That is not the governing principle defining the proof which requires a submission to the jury in these cases. The Missouri court's opinion implies its view that this is the governing standard by saying that the proofs must show that \"the injury would not have occurred but for the negligence\" of his employer, and that \"[t]he test of whether there is causal connection is that, absent the negligent act the injury would not have occurred.\"\n10\n That is language of proximate causation which makes a jury question dependent upon whether the jury may find that the defendant's negligence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.\n\nUnder this statute the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.\n11\n It does not matter that, from the evidence, the jury may also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute the result to other causes, including the employee's contributory negligence.\n12\n Judicial \n\n[352 \nU.S. 500, 507]\n\u00a0\n appraisal of the proofs to determine whether a jury question is presented is narrowly limited to the single inquiry whether, with reason, the conclusion may be drawn that negligence of the employer played any part at all in the injury or death.\n13\n Judges are to fix their sights primarily to make that appraisal and, if that test is met, are bound to find that a case for the jury is made out whether or not the evidence allows the jury a choice of other probabilities. The statute expressly imposes liability upon the employer to pay damages for injury or death due \"in whole or in part\" to its negligence.\n14\n (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe law was enacted because the Congress was dissatisfied with the common-law duty of the master to his servant.\n15\n The statute supplants that duty with the far more drastic duty of paying damages for injury or death at work due in whole or in part to the employer's negligence. The employer is stripped of his common-law \n\n[352 \nU.S. 500, 508]\n\u00a0\n defenses and for practical purposes the inquiry in these cases today rarely presents more than the single question whether negligence of the employer played any part, however small, in the injury or death which is the subject of the suit.\n16\n The burden of the employee is met, and the obligation of the employer to pay damages arises, when there is proof, even though entirely circumstantial,\n17\n from which the jury may with reason make that inference.\n\nThe Congress when adopting the law was particularly concerned that the issues whether there was employer fault and whether that fault played any part in the injury or death of the employee should be decided by the jury whenever fair-minded men could reach these conclusions on the evidence.\n18\n Originally, judicial administration of the 1908 Act substantially limited the cases in which employees were allowed a jury determination. That was because the courts developed concepts of assumption of risk\n19\n and of the coverage of the law,\n20\n which defeated \n\n[352 \nU.S. 500, 509]\n\u00a0\n employee claims as a matter of law. Congress corrected this by the 1939 amendments and removed the fetters which hobbled the full play of the basic congressional intention to leave to the fact-finding function of the jury the decision of the primary question raised in these cases - whether employer fault played any part in the employee's mishap.\n21\n\u00a0\n\nCognizant of the duty to effectuate the intention of the Congress to secure the right to a jury determination, this Court is vigilant to exercise its power of review in any case where it appears that the litigants have been improperly deprived of that determination.\n22\n Some say the Act has shortcomings and would prefer a workmen's compensation scheme. The fact that Congress has not seen fit to substitute that scheme cannot relieve this Court of its obligation to effectuate the present congressional intention by granting certiorari to correct instances of improper administration of the Act and to prevent its erosion by narrow and niggardly construction. Similarly, once certiorari is granted, the fact that the case arises under the Federal Employers' Liability Act cannot in any wise justify a failure on our part to afford the litigants the same measure of review on the merits as in every other case.\n23\n\u00a0\n\nThe kind of misconception evidenced in the opinion below, which fails to take into account the special features of this statutory negligence action that make it significantly different from the ordinary common-law negligence \n\n[352 \nU.S. 500, 510]\n\u00a0\n action, has required this Court to review a number of cases.\n24\n In a relatively large percentage of the cases reviewed, the Court has found that lower courts have not given proper scope to this integral part of the congressional scheme. We reach the same conclusion in this case.\n25\n The decisions of this Court after the 1939 amendments teach that the Congress vested the power of decision in these actions exclusively in the jury in all but the infrequent cases\n26\n where fair-minded jurors cannot honestly differ whether fault of the employer played any part in the employee's injury. Special and important reasons for the grant of certiorari in these cases are certainly present when lower federal and state courts persistently deprive litigants of their right to a jury determination. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 500, 511]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have considered the remaining questions not passed upon by the Supreme Court of Missouri, and find them to be unsubstantial. Accordingly, we remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON concurs in the result.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri.\n\n[For dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, see post, p. 524.]\n\n[For opinion of MR.

The Court of Appeals has held, without opinion, that petitioner's notice of appeal from the District Court, filed on July 8, 1957, was untimely. The Government has conceded that the Clerk of the District Court did not mail to petitioner or his attorney a notice of the entry of the order of June 14 denying petitioner's motion for a new trial and judgment of acquittal, as required by Rule 49 (c), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In our opinion the record in this case fails to show with sufficient certainty that petitioner or his attorney had actual notice of the entry of that order by reason of the proceedings which took place in the District Court on June 14.\n*\n Cf. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 80, 81]\n\u00a0\n Huff v.

What transpired at those proceedings is too ambiguous to permit the conclusion that petitioner and his attorney were not justified in believing that petitioner's time to appeal would begin to run on July 8. In these circumstances we think that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that petitioner's notice of appeal was untimely. Rule 37 (a) (2), Fed. Rules Crim. Proc.; see Carter v.

Pp. 479-494.\n\n2. \nIn the Alberts case, the constitutionality of 311 of West's California Penal Code Ann., 1955, which, inter alia, makes it a misdemeanor to keep for sale, or to advertise, material that is \"obscene or indecent,\" and Alberts' conviction thereunder for lewdly keeping for sale obscene and indecent books and for writing, composing, and publishing an obscene advertisement of them, are sustained. Pp. 479-494.\n\n3. \nObscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected freedom of speech or press - either (1) under the First Amendment, as to the Federal Government, or (2) under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as to the States. Pp. 481-485.\n\n (a) In the light of history, it is apparent that the unconditional phrasing of the First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance. Pp. 482-483.\n\n\n (b) The protection given speech and press was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people. P. 484.\n\n\n (c) All ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance - unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion - have the full protection of the guaranties, unless excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests; but implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance. Pp. 484-485. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n4. \nSince obscenity is not protected, constitutional guaranties were not violated in these cases merely because, under the trial judges' instructions to the juries, convictions could be had without proof either that the obscene material would perceptibly create a clear and present danger of antisocial conduct, or probably would induce its recipients to such conduct. Beauharnais v. Illinois, \n343 \nU.S. 250\n. Pp. 485-490.\n\n (a) Sex and obscenity are not synonymous. Obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest - i. e., material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts. P. 487.\n\n\n (b) It is vital that the standards for judging obscenity safeguard the protection of freedom of speech and press for material which does not treat sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest. Pp. 487-488.\n\n\n (c) The standard for judging obscenity, adequate to withstand the charge of constitutional infirmity, is whether, to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest. Pp. 488-489.\n\n\n (d) In these cases, both trial courts sufficiently followed the proper standard and used the proper definition of obscenity. Pp. 489-490.\n\n\n5. \nWhen applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, 18 U.S.C. 1461, which makes punishable the mailing of material that is \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy . . . or other publication of an indecent character,\" does not (1) violate the freedom of speech or press guaranteed by the First Amendment, or (2) violate the constitutional requirements of due process by failing to provide reasonably ascertainable standards of guilt. Pp. 491-492.\n\n6. \nWhen applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, 311 of West's California Penal Code Ann., 1955, which, inter alia, makes it a misdemeanor to keep for sale or to advertise material that is \"obscene or indecent,\" does not (1) violate the freedom of speech or press guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment against encroachment by the States, or (2) violate the constitutional requirements of due process by failing to provide reasonably ascertainable standards of guilt. 491-492.\n\n7. \nThe federal obscenity statute, 18 U.S.C. 1461, punishing the use of the mails for obscene material, is a proper exercise of the postal power delegated to Congress by Art.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe constitutionality of a criminal obscenity statute is the question in each of these cases. In Roth, the primary constitutional question is whether the federal obscenity statute\n1\n violates the provision of the First Amendment that \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press . . . .\" In Alberts, the primary constitutional question is whether the obscenity provisions of the California Penal Code\n2\n invade the freedoms of speech and press as they may be incorporated in \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n the liberty protected from state action by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOther constitutional questions are: whether these statutes violate due process,\n3\n because too vague to support conviction for crime; whether power to punish speech and press offensive to decency and morality is in the States alone, so that the federal obscenity statute violates the Ninth and Tenth Amendments (raised in Roth); and whether Congress, by enacting the federal obscenity statute, under the power delegated by Art. I, 8, cl. 7, to establish post offices and post roads, pre-empted the regulation of the subject matter (raised in Alberts).\n\nRoth conducted a business in New York in the publication and sale of books, photographs and magazines. He used circulars and advertising matter to solicit sales. He was convicted by a jury in the District Court for the Southern District of New York upon 4 counts of a 26-count indictment charging him with mailing obscene circulars and advertising, and an obscene book, in violation of the federal obscenity statute. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n4\n We granted certiorari.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlberts conducted a mail-order business from Los Angeles. He was convicted by the Judge of the Municipal Court of the Beverly Hills Judicial District (having waived a jury trial) under a misdemeanor complaint which charged him with lewdly keeping for sale obscene and indecent books, and with writing, composing and publishing an obscene advertisement of them, in violation of the California Penal Code. The conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Los Angeles.\n6\n We noted probable jurisdiction.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe dispositive question is whether obscenity is utterance within the area of protected speech and press.\n8\n Although this is the first time the question has been squarely presented to this Court, either under the First Amendment or under the Fourteenth Amendment, expressions found in numerous opinions indicate that this Court has always assumed that obscenity is not protected by the freedoms of speech and press.

Illinois, \n343 \nU.S. 250, 266\n.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe guaranties of freedom of expression\n10\n in effect in 10 of the 14 States which by 1792 had ratified the Constitution, gave no absolute protection for every utterance. Thirteen of the 14 States provided for the prosecution of libel,\n11\n and all of those States made either blasphemy or profanity, or both, statutory crimes.\n12\n As early as \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n 1712, Massachusetts made it criminal to publish \"any filthy, obscene, or profane song, pamphlet, libel or mock sermon\" in imitation or mimicking of religious services. Acts and Laws of the Province of Mass. Bay, c. CV, 8 (1712), Mass. Bay Colony Charters & Laws 399 (1814). Thus, profanity and obscenity were related offenses.\n\nIn light of this history, it is apparent that the unconditional phrasing of the First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance. This phrasing did not prevent this Court from concluding that libelous utterances are not within the area of constitutionally protected speech. Beauharnais v. Illinois, \n343 \nU.S. 250, 266\n. At the time of the adoption of the First Amendment, obscenity law was not as fully developed as libel law, but there is sufficiently contemporaneous evidence to show that obscenity, too, was outside the protection intended for speech and press.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe protection given speech and press was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people. This objective was made explicit as early as 1774 in a letter of the Continental Congress to the inhabitants of Quebec:\n\n \"The last right we shall mention, regards the freedom of the press. The importance of this consists, besides the advancement of truth, science, morality, and arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on the administration of Government, its ready communication of thoughts between subjects, and its consequential promotion of union among them, whereby oppressive officers are shamed or intimidated, into more honourable and just modes of conducting affairs.\" 1 Journals of the Continental Congress 108 (1774).\n\n\n All ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance - unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion - have the full protection of the guaranties, unless excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests.\n14\n But implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance. This rejection for \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 485]\n\u00a0\n that reason is mirrored in the universal judgment that obscenity should be restrained, reflected in the international agreement of over 50 nations,\n15\n in the obscenity laws of all of the 48 States,\n16\n and in the 20 obscenity laws enacted by the Congress from 1842 to 1956.\n17\n This is the same judgment expressed by this Court in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, \n315 \nU.S. 568, 571\n-572:\n\n \". . . There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene . . . . It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality. . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n We hold that obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.\n\nIt is strenuously urged that these obscenity statutes offend the constitutional guaranties because they punish \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 486]\n\u00a0\n incitation to impure sexual thoughts, not shown to be related to any overt antisocial conduct which is or may be incited in the persons stimulated to such thoughts. In Roth, the trial judge instructed the jury: \"The words `obscene, lewd and lascivious' as used in the law, signify that form of immorality which has relation to sexual impurity and has a tendency to excite lustful thoughts.\" (Emphasis added.) In Alberts, the trial judge applied the test laid down in People v. Wepplo, 78 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 959, 178 P.2d 853, namely, whether the material has \"a substantial tendency to deprave or corrupt its readers by inciting lascivious thoughts or arousing lustful desires.\" (Emphasis added.) It is insisted that the constitutional guaranties are violated because convictions may be had without proof either that obscene material will perceptibly create a clear and present danger of antisocial conduct,\n18\n or will probably induce its recipients to such conduct.\n19\n But, in light of our holding that obscenity is not protected speech, the complete answer to this argument is in the holding of this Court in Beauharnais v. Illinois, supra, at 266:\n\n \"Libelous utterances not being within the area of constitutionally protected speech, it is unnecessary, either for us or for the State courts, to consider the issues behind the phrase `clear and present danger.' Certainly no one would contend that obscene speech, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 487]\n\u00a0\n for example, may be punished only upon a showing of such circumstances. Libel, as we have seen, is in the same class.\"\n\n\n However, sex and obscenity are not synonymous. Obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.\n20\n The portrayal of sex, e. g., in art, literature and scientific works,\n21\n is not itself sufficient reason to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press. Sex, a great and mysterious motive force in human life, has indisputably been a subject of absorbing interest to mankind through the ages; it is one of the vital problems of human interest and public concern. As to all such problems, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 488]\n\u00a0\n this Court said in Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 101\n-102:\n\n \"The freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the Constitution embraces at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern without previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment. The exigencies of the colonial period and the efforts to secure freedom from oppressive administration developed a broadened conception of these liberties as adequate to supply the public need for information and education with respect to the significant issues of the times. . . . Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n The fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well-being of our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth.\n22\n Ceaseless vigilance is the watchword to prevent their erosion by Congress or by the States. The door barring federal and state intrusion into this area cannot be left ajar; it must be kept tightly closed and opened only the slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment upon more important interests.\n23\n It is therefore vital that the standards for judging obscenity safeguard the protection of freedom of speech and press for material which does not treat sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.\n\nThe early leading standard of obscenity allowed material to be judged merely by the effect of an isolated \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 489]\n\u00a0\n excerpt upon particularly susceptible persons. Regina v. Hicklin, 1868. L. R. 3 Q. B. 360.\n24\n Some American courts adopted this standard\n25\n but later decisions have rejected it and substituted this test: whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\n26\n The Hicklin test, judging obscenity by the effect of isolated passages upon the most susceptible persons, might well encompass material legitimately treating with sex, and so it must be rejected as unconstitutionally restrictive of the freedoms of speech and press. On the other hand, the substituted standard provides safeguards adequate to withstand the charge of constitutional infirmity.\n\nBoth trial courts below sufficiently followed the proper standard. Both courts used the proper definition of obscenity. In addition, in the Alberts case, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, the trial judge indicated that, as the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 490]\n\u00a0\n trier of facts, he was judging each item as a whole as it would affect the normal person,\n27\n and in Roth, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:\n\n \". . . The test is not whether it would arouse sexual desires or sexual impure thoughts in those comprising a particular segment of the community, the young, the immature or the highly prudish or would leave another segment, the scientific or highly educated or the so-called worldly-wise and sophisticated indifferent and unmoved. . . .\n\n\n \"The test in each case is the effect of the book, picture or publication considered as a whole, not upon any particular class, but upon all those whom it is likely to reach. In other words, you determine its impact upon the average person in the community. The books, pictures and circulars must be judged as a whole, in their entire context, and you are not to consider detached or separate portions in reaching a conclusion. You judge the circulars, pictures and publications which have been put in evidence by present-day standards of the community. You may ask yourselves does it offend the common conscience of the community by present-day standards.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"In this case, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you and you alone are the exclusive judges of what the common conscience of the community is, and in determining that conscience you are to consider the community as a whole, young and old, educated and uneducated, the religious and the irreligious - men, women and children.\" \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 491]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n It is argued that the statutes do not provide reasonably ascertainable standards of guilt and therefore violate the constitutional requirements of due process. Winters v. New York, \n333 \nU.S. 507\n. The federal obscenity statute makes punishable the mailing of material that is \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy . . . or other publication of an indecent character.\"\n28\n The California statute makes punishable, inter alia, the keeping for sale or advertising material that is \"obscene or indecent.\" The thrust of the argument is that these words are not sufficiently precise because they do not mean the same thing to all people, all the time, everywhere.\n\nMany decisions have recognized that these terms of obscenity statutes are not precise.\n29\n This Court, however, has consistently held that lack of precision is not itself offensive to the requirements of due process. \". . . [T]he Constitution does not require impossible standards\"; all that is required is that the language \"conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. . . .\" United States v. Petrillo, \n332 \nU.S. 1, 7\n-8. These words, applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, already discussed, give adequate warning of the conduct proscribed and mark \". . . boundaries sufficiently distinct for judges and juries fairly to administer the law . . . . That there may be marginal cases in which it is difficult to determine the side of the line on \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 492]\n\u00a0\n which a particular fact situation falls is no sufficient reason to hold the language too ambiguous to define a criminal offense. . . .\" Id., at 7. See also United States v. Harriss, \n347 \nU.S. 612, 624\n, n. 15; Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 337, 340\n; United States v. Ragen, \n314 \nU.S. 513, 523\n-524; United States v. Wurzbach, \n280 \nU.S. 396\n; Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497\n; Fox v. Washington, \n236 \nU.S. 273\n; Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373\n.\n30\n\u00a0\n\nIn summary, then, we hold that these statutes, applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, do not offend constitutional safeguards against convictions based upon protected material, or fail to give men in acting adequate notice of what is prohibited.\n\nRoth's argument that the federal obscenity statute unconstitutionally encroaches upon the powers reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the States and to the people to punish speech and press where offensive to decency and morality is hinged upon his contention that obscenity is expression not excepted from the sweep of the provision of the First Amendment that \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) That argument falls in light of our holding that obscenity is not expression protected by the First Amendment.\n31\n We \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 493]\n\u00a0\n therefore hold that the federal obscenity statute punishing the use of the mails for obscene material is a proper exercise of the postal power delegated to Congress by Art. I, 8, cl. 7.\n32\n In United Public Workers v. Mitchell, \n330 \nU.S. 75, 95\n-96, this Court said:\n\n \". . . The powers granted by the Constitution to the Federal Government are subtracted from the totality of sovereignty originally in the states and the people. Therefore, when objection is made that the exercise of a federal power infringes upon rights reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, the inquiry must be directed toward the granted power under which the action of the Union was taken. If granted power is found, necessarily the objection of invasion of those rights, reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, must fail. . . .\"\n\n\n Alberts argues that because his was a mail-order business, the California statute is repugnant to Art. I, 8, cl. 7, under which the Congress allegedly pre-empted the regulatory field by enacting the federal obscenity statute punishing the mailing or advertising by mail of obscene material. The federal statute deals only with actual \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 494]\n\u00a0\n mailing; it does not eliminate the power of the state to punish \"keeping for sale\" or \"advertising\" obscene material. The state statute in no way imposes a burden or interferes with the federal postal functions. \". . . The decided cases which indicate the limits of state regulatory power in relation to the federal mail service involve situations where state regulation involved a direct, physical interference with federal activities under the postal power or some direct, immediate burden on the performance of the postal functions. . . .\" Railway Mail Assn. v. Corsi, \n326 \nU.S. 88, 96\n.\n\nThe judgments are\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The federal obscenity statute provided, in pertinent part: \"Every obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy book, pamphlet, picture, paper, letter, writing, print, or other publication of an indecent character; and - .  .  .  .  . \"Every written or printed card, letter, circular, book, pamphlet, advertisement, or notice of any kind giving information, directly or indirectly, where, or how, or from whom, or by what means any of such mentioned matters, articles, or things may be obtained or made, . . . whether sealed or unsealed . . . .  .  .  .  . \"Is declared to be nonmailable matter and shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier. \"Whoever knowingly deposits for mailing or delivery, anything declared by this section to be nonmailable, or knowingly takes the same from the mails for the purpose of circulating or disposing thereof, or of aiding in the circulation or disposition thereof, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\" 18 U.S.C. 1461.

United States, \n165 \nU.S. 486, 499\n-500.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] For the same reason, we reject, in this case, the argument that there is greater latitude for state action under the word \"liberty\" under the Fourteenth Amendment than is allowed to Congress by the language of the First Amendment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] In Public Clearing House v. Coyne, \n194 \nU.S. 497, 506\n-508, this Court said: \"The constitutional principles underlying the administration of the Post Office Department were discussed in the opinion of the court in Ex parte Jackson, \n96 \nU.S. 727\n, in which we held that the power vested in Congress to establish post offices and post roads embraced the regulation of the entire postal system of the country; that Congress might designate what might be carried in the mails and what excluded . . . . It may . . . refuse to include in its mails such printed matter or merchandise as may seem objectionable to it upon the ground of public policy . . . . For more than thirty years not only has the transmission of obscene matter been prohibited, but it has been made a crime, punishable by fine or imprisonment, for a person to deposit such matter in the mails. The constitutionality of this law we believe has never been attacked. . . .\"\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, concurring in the result.\n\nI agree with the result reached by the Court in these cases, but, because we are operating in a field of expression and because broad language used here may eventually be applied to the arts and sciences and freedom of communication generally, I would limit our decision to the facts before us and to the validity of the statutes in question as applied.\n\nAppellant Alberts was charged with wailfully, unlawfully and lewdly disseminating obscene matter. Obscenity has been construed by the California courts to mean having a substantial tendency to corrupt by arousing lustful desires. People v. Wepplo, 78 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 959, 178 P.2d 853. Petitioner Roth was indicted for unlawfully, wailfully and knowingly mailing obscene material that was calculated to corrupt and debauch the minds and morals of those to whom it was sent. Each was accorded all the protections of a criminal trial. Among other things, they contend that the statutes under which they were convicted violate the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech, press and communication. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 495]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThat there is a social problem presented by obscenity is attested by the expression of the legislatures of the forty-eight States as well as the Congress. To recognize the existence of a problem, however, does not require that we sustain any and all measures adopted to meet that problem. The history of the application of laws designed to suppress the obscene demonstrates convincingly that the power of government can be invoked under them against great art or literature, scientific treatises, or works exciting social controversy. Mistakes of the past prove that there is a strong countervailing interest to be considered in the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe line dividing the salacious or pornographic from literature or science is not straight and unwavering. Present laws depend largely upon the effect that the materials may have upon those who receive them. It is manifest that the same object may have a different impact, varying according to the part of the community it reached. But there is more to these cases. It is not the book that is on trial; it is a person. The conduct of the defendant is the central issue, not the obscenity of a book or picture. The nature of the materials is, of course, relevant as an attribute of the defendant's conduct, but the materials are thus placed in context from which they draw color and character. A wholly different result might be reached in a different setting.\n\nThe personal element in these cases is seen most strongly in the requirement of scienter. Under the California law, the prohibited activity must be done \"wailfully and lewdly.\" The federal statute limits the crime to acts done \"knowingly.\" In his charge to the jury, the district judge stated that the matter must be \"calculated\" to corrupt or debauch. The defendants in both these cases were engaged in the business of purveying textual or \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 496]\n\u00a0\n graphic matter openly advertised to appeal to the erotic interest of their customers. They were plainly engaged in the commercial exploitation of the morbid and shameful craving for materials with prurient effect. I believe that the State and Federal Governments can constitutionally punish such conduct. That is all that these cases present to us, and that is all we need to decide.\n\nI agree with the Court's decision in its rejection of the other contentions raised by these defendants.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the result in No. 61, and dissenting in No. 582.\n\nI regret not to be able to join the Court's opinion. I cannot do so because I find lurking beneath its disarming generalizations a number of problems which not only leave me with serious misgivings as to the future effect of today's decisions, but which also, in my view, call for different results in these two cases.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nMy basic difficulties with the Court's opinion are threefold. First, the opinion paints with such a broad brush that I fear it may result in a loosening of the tight reins which state and federal courts should hold upon the enforcement of obscenity statutes. Second, the Court fails to discriminate between the different factors which, in my opinion, are involved in the constitutional adjudication of state and federal obscenity cases. Third, relevant distinctions between the two obscenity statutes here involved, and the Court's own definition of \"obscenity,\" are ignored.\n\nIn final analysis, the problem presented by these cases is how far, and on what terms, the state and federal governments have power to punish individuals for disseminating books considered to be undesirable because of their \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 497]\n\u00a0\n nature or supposed deleterious effect upon human conduct. Proceeding from the premise that \"no issue is presented in either case, concerning the obscenity of the material involved,\" the Court finds the \"dispositive question\" to be \"whether obscenity is utterance within the area of protected speech and press,\" and then holds that \"obscenity\" is not so protected because it is \"utterly without redeeming social importance.\" This sweeping formula appears to me to beg the very question before us. The Court seems to assume that \"obscenity\" is a peculiar genus of \"speech and press,\" which is as distinct, recognizable, and classifiable as poison ivy is among other plants. On this basis the constitutional question before us simply becomes, as the Court says, whether \"obscenity,\" as an abstraction, is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and the question whether a particular book may be suppressed becomes a mere matter of classification, of \"fact,\" to be entrusted to a fact-finder and insulated from independent constitutional judgment. But surely the problem cannot be solved in such a generalized fashion. Every communication has an individuality and \"value\" of its own. The suppression of a particular writing or other tangible form of expression is, therefore, an individual matter, and in the nature of things every such suppression raises an individual constitutional problem, in which a reviewing court must determine for itself whether the attacked expression is suppressable within constitutional standards. Since those standards do not readily lend themselves to generalized definitions, the constitutional problem in the last analysis becomes one of particularized judgments which appellate courts must make for themselves.\n\nI do not think that reviewing courts can escape this responsibility by saying that the trier of the facts, be it a jury or a judge, has labeled the questioned matter as \"obscene,\" for, if \"obscenity\" is to be suppressed, the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 498]\n\u00a0\n question whether a particular work is of that character involves not really an issue of fact but a question of constitutional judgment of the most sensitive and delicate kind. Many juries might find that Joyce's \"Ulysses\" or Bocaccio's \"Decameron\" was obscene, and yet the conviction of a defendant for selling either book would raise, for me, the gravest constitutional problems, for no such verdict could convince me, without more, that these books are \"utterly without redeeming social importance.\" In short, I do not understand how the Court can resolve the constitutional problems now before it without making its own independent judgment upon the character of the material upon which these convictions were based. I am very much afraid that the broad manner in which the Court has decided these cases will tend to obscure the peculiar responsibilities resting on state and federal courts in this field and encourage them to rely on easy labeling and jury verdicts as a substitute for facing up to the tough individual problems of constitutional judgment involved in every obscenity case.\n\nMy second reason for dissatisfaction with the Court's opinion is that the broad strides with which the Court has proceeded has led it to brush aside with perfunctory ease the vital constitutional considerations which, in my opinion, differentiate these two cases. It does not seem to matter to the Court that in one case we balance the power of a State in this field against the restrictions of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in the other the power of the Federal Government against the limitations of the First Amendment. I deal with this subject more particularly later.\n\nThirdly, the Court has not been bothered by the fact that the two cases involve different statutes. In California the book must have a \"tendency to deprave or corrupt its readers\"; under the federal statute it must tend \"to stir sexual impulses and lead to sexually impure \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 499]\n\u00a0\n thoughts.\"\n1\n The two statutes do not seem to me to present the same problems. Yet the Court compounds confusion when it superimposes on these two statutory definitions a third, drawn from the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 6: \"A thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest.\" The bland assurance that this definition is the same as the ones with which we deal flies in the face of the authors' express rejection of the \"deprave and corrupt\" and \"sexual thoughts\" tests:\n\n\"Obscenity [in the Tentative Draft] is defined in terms of material which appeals predominantly to prurient interest in sexual matters and which goes beyond customary freedom of expression in these matters. We reject the prevailing test of tendency to arouse lustful thoughts or desires because it is \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 500]\n\u00a0\n unrealistically broad for a society that plainly tolerates a great deal of erotic interest in literature, advertising, and art, and because regulation of thought or desire, unconnected with overt misbehavior, raises the most acute constitutional as well as practical difficulties. We likewise reject the common definition of obscene as that which `tends to corrupt or debase.' If this means anything different from tendency to arouse lustful thought and desire, it suggests that change of character or actual misbehavior follows from contact with obscenity. Evidence of such consequences is lacking . . . . On the other hand, `appeal to prurient interest' refers to qualities of the material itself: the capacity to attract individuals eager for a forbidden look . . . .\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n As this passage makes clear, there is a significant distinction between the definitions used in the prosecutions before us, and the American Law Institute formula. If, therefore, the latter is the correct standard, as my Brother BRENNAN elsewhere intimates,\n3\n then these convictions should surely be reversed. Instead, the Court merely assimilates the various tests into one indiscriminate potpourri.\n\nI now pass to the consideration of the two cases before us.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nI concur in the judgment of the Court in No. 61, Alberts v. California.\n\nThe question in this case is whether the defendant was deprived of liberty without due process of law when he was convicted for selling certain materials found by the judge to be obscene because they would have a \"tendency \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 501]\n\u00a0\n to deprave or corrupt its readers by exciting lascivious thoughts or arousing lustful desire.\"\n\nIn judging the constitutionality of this conviction, we should remember that our function in reviewing state judgments under the Fourteenth Amendment is a narrow one. We do not decide whether the policy of the State is wise, or whether it is based on assumptions scientifically substantiated. We can inquire only whether the state action so subverts the fundamental liberties implicit in the Due Process Clause that it cannot be sustained as a rational exercise of power. See Jackson, J., dissenting in Beauharnais v. Illinois, \n343 \nU.S. 250, 287\n. The States' power to make printed words criminal is, of course, confined by the Fourteenth Amendment, but only insofar as such power is inconsistent with our concepts of \"ordered liberty.\" Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 324\n-325.\n\nWhat, then, is the purpose of this California statute? Clearly the state legislature has made the judgment that printed words can \"deprave or corrupt\" the reader - that words can incite to antisocial or immoral action. The assumption seems to be that the distribution of certain types of literature will induce criminal or immoral sexual conduct. It is well known, of course, that the validity of this assumption is a matter of dispute among critics, sociologists, psychiatrists, and penologists. There is a large school of thought, particularly in the scientific community, which denies any causal connection between the reading of pornography and immorality, crime, or delinquency. Others disagree. Clearly it is not our function to decide this question. That function belongs to the state legislature. Nothing in the Constitution requires California to accept as truth the most advanced and sophisticated psychiatric opinion. It seems to me clear that it is not irrational, in our present state of knowledge, to consider that pornography can induce a type of sexual conduct which a State may deem obnoxious to the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 502]\n\u00a0\n moral fabric of society. In fact the very division of opinion on the subject counsels us to respect the choice made by the State.\n\nFurthermore, even assuming that pornography cannot be deemed ever to cause, in an immediate sense, criminal sexual conduct, other interests within the proper cognizance of the States may be protected by the prohibition placed on such materials. The State can reasonably draw the inference that over a long period of time the indiscriminate dissemination of materials, the essential character of which is to degrade sex, will have an eroding effect on moral standards. And the State has a legitimate interest in protecting the privacy of the home against invasion of unsolicited obscenity.\n\nAbove all stands the realization that we deal here with an area where knowledge is small, data are insufficient, and experts are divided. Since the domain of sexual morality is pre-eminently a matter of state concern, this Court should be slow to interfere with state legislation calculated to protect that morality. It seems to me that nothing in the broad and flexible command of the Due Process Clause forbids California to prosecute one who sells books whose dominant tendency might be to \"deprave or corrupt\" a reader. I agree with the Court, of course, that the books must be judged as a whole and in relation to the normal adult reader.\n\nWhat has been said, however, does not dispose of the case. It still remains for us to decide whether the state court's determination that this material should be suppressed is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment; and that, of course, presents a federal question as to which we, and not the state court, have the ultimate responsibility. And so, in the final analysis, I concur in the judgment because, upon an independent perusal of the material involved, and in light of the considerations discussed \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 503]\n\u00a0\n above, I cannot say that its suppression would so interfere with the communication of \"ideas\" in any proper sense of that term that it would offend the Due Process Clause. I therefore agree with the Court that appellant's conviction must be affirmed.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nI dissent in No. 582, Roth v. United States.\n\nWe are faced here with the question whether the federal obscenity statute, as construed and applied in this case, violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. To me, this question is of quite a different order than one where we are dealing with state legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment. I do not think it follows that state and federal powers in this area are the same, and that just because the State may suppress a particular utterance, it is automatically permissible for the Federal Government to do the same. I agree with Mr. Justice Jackson that the historical evidence does not bear out the claim that the Fourteenth Amendment \"incorporates\" the First in any literal sense. See Beauharnais v. Illinois, supra. But laying aside any consequences which might flow from that conclusion, cf. Mr. Justice Holmes in Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 672\n,\n4\n I prefer to rest my views about this case on broader and less abstract grounds.\n\nThe Constitution differentiates between those areas of human conduct subject to the regulation of the States and those subject to the powers of the Federal Government. The substantive powers of the two governments, in many \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 504]\n\u00a0\n instances, are distinct. And in every case where we are called upon to balance the interest in free expression against other interests, it seems to me important that we should keep in the forefront the question of whether those other interests are state or federal. Since under our constitutional scheme the two are not necessarily equivalent, the balancing process must needs often produce different results. Whether a particular limitation on speech or press is to be upheld because it subserves a paramount governmental interest must, to a large extent, I think, depend on whether that government has, under the Constitution, a direct substantive interest, that is, the power to act, in the particular area involved.\n\nThe Federal Government has, for example, power to restrict seditious speech directed against it, because that Government certainly has the substantive authority to protect itself against revolution. Cf. Pennsylvania v. Nelson, \n350 \nU.S. 497\n. But in dealing with obscenity we are faced with the converse situation, for the interests which obscenity statutes purportedly protect are primarily entrusted to the care, not of the Federal Government, but of the States. Congress has no substantive power over sexual morality. Such powers as the Federal Government has in this field are but incidental to its other powers, here the postal power, and are not of the same nature as those possessed by the States, which bear direct responsibility for the protection of the local moral fabric.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 505]\n\u00a0\n What Mr. Justice Jackson said in Beauharnais, supra, \n343 \nU.S., at 294\n-295, about criminal libel is equally true of obscenity:\n\n \"The inappropriateness of a single standard for restricting State and Nation is indicated by the disparity between their functions and duties in relation to those freedoms. Criminality of defamation is predicated upon power either to protect the private right to enjoy integrity of reputation or the public right to tranquillity. Neither of these are objects of federal cognizance except when necessary to the accomplishment of some delegated power . . . . When the Federal Government puts liberty of press in one scale, it has a very limited duty to personal reputation or local tranquillity to weigh against it in the other. But state action affecting speech or press can and should be weighed against and reconciled with these conflicting social interests.\"\n\n\n Not only is the federal interest in protecting the Nation against pornography attenuated, but the dangers of federal censorship in this field are far greater than anything the States may do. It has often been said that one of the great strengths of our federal system is that we have, in the forty-eight States, forty-eight experimental social laboratories. \"State statutory law reflects predominantly this capacity of a legislature to introduce novel techniques of social control. The federal system has the immense advantage of providing forty-eight separate centers for such experimentation.\"\n6\n Different States will have different attitudes toward the same work of literature. The same book which is freely read in one State might be \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 506]\n\u00a0\n classed as obscene in another.\n7\n And it seems to me that no overwhelming danger to our freedom to experiment and to gratify our tastes in literature is likely to result from the suppression of a borderline book in one of the States, so long as there is no uniform nation-wide suppression of the book, and so long as other States are free to experiment with the same or bolder books.\n\nQuite a different situation is presented, however, where the Federal Government imposes the ban. The danger is perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" goes so far beyond the acceptable standards of candor that it will be deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. The prerogative of the States to differ on their ideas of morality will be destroyed, the ability of States to experiment will be stunted. The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so seems to me to be intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.\n\nI judge this case, then, in view of what I think is the attenuated federal interest in this field, in view of the very real danger of a deadening uniformity which can result from nation-wide federal censorship, and in view of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 507]\n\u00a0\n fact that the constitutionality of this conviction must be weighed against the First and not the Fourteenth Amendment. So viewed, I do not think that this conviction can be upheld. The petitioner was convicted under a statute which, under the judge's charge,\n8\n makes it criminal to sell books which \"tend to stir sexual impulses and lead to sexually impure thoughts.\" I cannot agree that any book which tends to stir sexual impulses and lead to sexually impure thoughts necessarily is \"utterly without redeeming social importance\". Not only did this charge fail to measure up to the standards which I understand the Court to approve, but as far as I can see, much of the great literature of the world could lead to conviction under such a view of the statute. Moreover, in no event do I think that the limited federal interest in this area can extend to mere \"thoughts.\" The Federal Government has no business, whether under the postal or commerce power, to bar the sale of books because they might lead to any kind of \"thoughts.\"\n9\n\u00a0\n\nIt is no answer to say, as the Court does, that obscenity is not protected speech. The point is that this statute, as here construed, defines obscenity so widely that it encompasses matters which might very well be protected speech. I do not think that the federal statute can be constitutionally construed to reach other than what the Government has termed as \"hard-core\" pornography. Nor do I think the statute can fairly be read as directed \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 508]\n\u00a0\n only at persons who are engaged in the business of catering to the prurient minded, even though their wares fall short of hard-core pornography. Such a statute would raise constitutional questions of a different order. That being so, and since in my opinion the material here involved cannot be said to be hard-core pornography, I would reverse this case with instructions to dismiss the indictment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In Alberts v. California, the state definition of \"obscenity\" is, of course, binding on us. The definition there used derives from People v. Wepplo, 78 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 959, 178 P.2d 853, the question being whether the material has \"a substantive tendency to deprave or corrupt its readers by exciting lascivious thoughts or arousing lustful desire.\" In Roth v. United States, our grant of certiorari was limited to the question of the constitutionality of the statute, and did not encompass the correctness of the definition of \"obscenity\" adopted by the trial judge as a matter of statutory construction. We must therefore assume that the trial judge correctly defined that term, and deal with the constitutionality of the statute as construed and applied in this case. The two definitions do not seem to me synonymous. Under the federal definition it is enough if the jury finds that the book as a whole leads to certain thoughts. In California, the further inference must be drawn that such thoughts will have a substantive \"tendency to deprave or corrupt\" - i. e., that the thoughts induced by the material will affect character and action.

Thoughts and desires not manifested in overt antisocial behavior are generally regarded as the exclusive concern of the individual and his spiritual advisors.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\nWhen we sustain these convictions, we make the legality of a publication turn on the purity of thought which a book or tract instills in the mind of the reader. I do not think we can approve that standard and be faithful to the command of the First Amendment, which by its terms is a restraint on Congress and which by the Fourteenth is a restraint on the States.\n\nIn the Roth case the trial judge charged the jury that the statutory words \"obscene, lewd and lascivious\" describe \"that form of immorality which has relation to sexual impurity and has a tendency to excite lustful thoughts.\" He stated that the term \"filthy\" in the statute pertains \"to that sort of treatment of sexual matters in such a vulgar and indecent way, so that it tends to arouse a feeling of disgust and revulsion.\" He went on to say that the material \"must be calculated to corrupt and debauch the minds and morals\" of \"the average person in the community,\" not those of any particular class. \"You judge the circulars, pictures and publications which have been put in evidence by present-day standards of the community. You may ask yourselves does it offend the common conscience of the community by present-day standards.\"\n\nThe trial judge who, sitting without a jury, heard the Alberts case and the appellate court that sustained the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 509]\n\u00a0\n judgment of conviction, took California's definition of \"obscenity\" from People v. Wepplo, 78 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 959, 961, 178 P.2d 853, 855. That case held that a book is obscene \"if it has a substantial tendency to deprave or corrupt its readers by inciting lascivious thoughts or arousing lustful desire.\"\n\nBy these standards punishment is inflicted for thoughts provoked, not for overt acts nor antisocial conduct. This test cannot be squared with our decisions under the First Amendment. Even the ill-starred Dennis case conceded that speech to be punishable must have some relation to action which could be penalized by government. Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494, 502\n-511. Cf. Chafee, The Blessings of Liberty (1956), p. 69. This issue cannot be avoided by saying that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment. The question remains, what is the constitutional test of obscenity?\n\nThe tests by which these convictions were obtained require only the arousing of sexual thoughts. Yet the arousing of sexual thoughts and desires happens every day in normal life in dozens of ways. Nearly 30 years ago a questionnaire sent to college and normal school women graduates asked what things were most stimulating sexually. Of 409 replies, 9 said \"music\"; 18 said \"pictures\"; 29 said \"dancing\"; 40 said \"drama\"; 95 said \"books\"; and 218 said \"man.\" Alpert, Judicial Censorship of Obscene Literature, 52 Harv. L. Rev. 40, 73.\n\nThe test of obscenity the Court endorses today gives the censor free range over a vast domain. To allow the State to step in and punish mere speech or publication that the judge or the jury thinks has an undesirable impact on thoughts but that is not shown to be a part of unlawful action is drastically to curtail the First Amendment. As recently stated by two of our outstanding authorities on obscenity, \"The danger of influencing a change in the current moral standards of the community, or of shocking \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 510]\n\u00a0\n or offending readers, or of stimulating sex thoughts or desires apart from objective conduct, can never justify the losses to society that result from interference with literary freedom.\" Lockhart & McClure, Literature, The Law of Obscenity, and the Constitution, 38 Minn. L. Rev. 295, 387.\n\nIf we were certain that impurity of sexual thoughts impelled to action, we would be on less dangerous ground in punishing the distributors of this sex literature. But it is by no means clear that obscene literature, as so defined, is a significant factor in influencing substantial deviations from the community standards.\n\n\"There are a number of reasons for real and substantial doubts as to the soundness of that hypothesis. (1) Scientific studies of juvenile delinquency demonstrate that those who get into trouble, and are the greatest concern of the advocates of censorship, are far less inclined to read than those who do not become delinquent. The delinquents are generally the adventurous type, who have little use for reading and other non-active entertainment. Thus, even assuming that reading sometimes has an adverse effect upon moral conduct, the effect is not likely to be substantial, for those who are susceptible seldom read. (2) Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck, who are among the country's leading authorities on the treatment and causes of juvenile delinquency, have recently published the results of a ten year study of its causes. They exhaustively studied approximately 90 factors and influences that might lead to or explain juvenile delinquency, but the Gluecks gave no consideration to the type of reading material, if any, read by the delinquents. This is, of course, consistent with their finding that delinquents read very little. When those who know so much about the problem of delinquency among youth - the very \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 511]\n\u00a0\n group about whom the advocates of censorship are most concerned - conclude that what delinquents read has so little effect upon their conduct that it is not worth investigating in an exhaustive study of causes, there is good reason for serious doubt concerning the basic hypothesis on which obscenity censorship is defended. (3) The many other influences in society that stimulate sexual desire are so much more frequent in their influence, and so much more potent in their effect, that the influence of reading is likely, at most, to be relatively insignificant in the composite of forces that lead an individual into conduct deviating from the community sex standards. The Kinsey studies show the minor degree to which literature serves as a potent sexual stimulant. And the studies demonstrating that sex knowledge seldom results from reading indicates [sic] the relative unimportance of literature in sex thoughts as compared with other factors in society.\" Lockhart & McClure, op. cit. supra, pp. 385-386.\n\n\n The absence of dependable information on the effect of obscene literature on human conduct should make us wary. It should put us on the side of protecting society's interest in literature, except and unless it can be said that the particular publication has an impact on action that the government can control.\n\nAs noted, the trial judge in the Roth case charged the jury in the alternative that the federal obscenity statute outlaws literature dealing with sex which offends \"the common conscience of the community.\" That standard is, in my view, more inimical still to freedom of expression.\n\nThe standard of what offends \"the common conscience of the community\" conflicts, in my judgment, with the command of the First Amendment that \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 512]\n\u00a0\n of the press.\" Certainly that standard would not be an acceptable one if religion, economics, politics or philosophy were involved. How does it become a constitutional standard when literature treating with sex is concerned?\n\nAny test that turns on what is offensive to the community's standards is too loose, too capricious, too destructive of freedom of expression to be squared with the First Amendment. Under that test, juries can censor, suppress, and punish what they don't like, provided the matter relates to \"sexual impurity\" or has a tendency \"to excite lustful thoughts.\" This is community censorship in one of its worst forms. It creates a regime where in the battle between the literati and the Philistines, the Philistines are certain to win. If experience in this field teaches anything, it is that \"censorship of obscenity has almost always been both irrational and indiscriminate.\" Lockhart & McClure, op. cit. supra, at 371. The test adopted here accentuates that trend.\n\nI assume there is nothing in the Constitution which forbids Congress from using its power over the mails to proscribe conduct on the grounds of good morals. No one would suggest that the First Amendment permits nudity in public places, adultery, and other phases of sexual misconduct.\n\nI can understand (and at times even sympathize) with programs of civic groups and church groups to protect and defend the existing moral standards of the community. I can understand the motives of the Anthony Comstocks who would impose Victorian standards on the community. When speech alone is involved, I do not think that government, consistently with the First Amendment, can become the sponsor of any of these movements. I do not think that government, consistently with the First Amendment, can throw its weight behind one school or another. Government should be \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 513]\n\u00a0\n concerned with antisocial conduct, not with utterances. Thus, if the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech and press is to mean anything in this field, it must allow protests even against the moral code that the standard of the day sets for the community. In other words, literature should not be suppressed merely because it offends the moral code of the censor.\n\nThe legality of a publication in this country should never be allowed to turn either on the purity of thought which it instills in the mind of the reader or on the degree to which it offends the community conscience. By either test the role of the censor is exalted, and society's values in literary freedom are sacrificed.\n\nThe Court today suggests a third standard. It defines obscene material as that \"which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.\"\n*\n Like the standards applied by the trial judges below, that standard does not require any nexus between the literature which is prohibited and action which the legislature can regulate or prohibit. Under the First Amendment, that standard is no more valid than those which the courts below adopted.\n\nI do not think that the problem can be resolved by the Court's statement that \"obscenity is not expression protected \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 514]\n\u00a0\n by the First Amendment.\" With the exception of Beauharnais v. Illinois, \n343 \nU.S. 250\n, none of our cases has resolved problems of free speech and free press by placing any form of expression beyond the pale of the absolute prohibition of the First Amendment. Unlike the law of libel, wrongfully relied on in Beauharnais, there is no special historical evidence that literature dealing with sex was intended to be treated in a special manner by those who drafted the First Amendment. In fact, the first reported court decision in this country involving obscene literature was in 1821. Lockhart & McClure, op. cit. supra, at 324, n. 200. I reject too the implication that problems of freedom of speech and of the press are to be resolved by weighing against the values of free expression, the judgment of the Court that a particular form of that expression has \"no redeeming social importance.\" The First Amendment, its prohibition in terms absolute, was designed to preclude courts as well as legislatures from weighing the values of speech against silence. The First Amendment puts free speech in the preferred position.\n\nFreedom of expression can be suppressed if, and to the extent that, it is so closely brigaded with illegal action as to be an inseparable part of it. Giboney v. Empire Storage Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490, 498\n; Labor Board v. Virginia Power Co., \n314 \nU.S. 469, 477\n-478. As a people, we cannot afford to relax that standard. For the test that suppresses a cheap tract today can suppress a literary gem tomorrow. All it need do is to incite a lascivious thought or arouse a lustful desire. The list of books that judges or juries can place in that category is endless.\n\nI would give the broad sweep of the First Amendment full support. I have the same confidence in the ability of our people to reject noxious literature as I have in their capacity to sort out the true from the false in theology, economics, politics, or any other field.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The definition of obscenity which the Court adopts seems in substance to be that adopted by those who drafted the A. L. I., Model Penal Code. 207.10 (2) (Tentative Draft No. 6, 1957). \"Obscenity is defined in terms of material which appeals predominantly to prurient interest in sexual matters and which goes beyond customary freedom of expression in these matters. We reject the prevailing tests of tendency to arouse lustful thoughts or desires because it is unrealistically broad for a society that plainly tolerates a great deal of erotic interest in literature, advertising, and art, and because regulation of thought or desire, unconnected with overt misbehavior, raises the most acute constitutional as well as practical difficulties.\" Id., at 10. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 476, 515]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROVIARO v. UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 58\nArgued: December 11, 1956Decided: March 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was convicted in a Federal District Court for violating 21 U.S.C. 174, by knowingly possessing and transporting heroin imported unlawfully. In the face of repeated demands by petitioner for disclosure, the trial court sustained the Government's refusal to disclose the identity of an undercover informer who had taken a material part in bringing about petitioner's possession of the drugs, had been present with petitioner at the occurrence of the alleged crime, and might have been a material witness as to whether petitioner knowingly transported the drugs as charged. Held: In the circumstances of this case, failure of the court to require disclosure of the identity of the informer was reversible error. Pp. 54-66.\n\n (a) Where disclosure of an informer's identity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair trial, the Government's privilege to withhold disclosure of the informer's identity must give way. Pp. 60-62.\n\n\n (b) However, no fixed rule is justifiable. The public interest in protecting the flow of information to the Government must be balanced against the individual's right to prepare his defense. Whether nondisclosure is erroneous depends on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer's testimony, and other relevant factors. P. 62.\n\n\n (c) In this case, the informer was not expressly mentioned in the relevant charge of the indictment; but the charge, viewed in connection with the evidence introduced at his trial, is so closely related to the informer as to make his identity and testimony highly material. Pp. 62-63.\n\n\n (d) The provision of the statute authorizing a conviction when the Government has proved that the accused possessed narcotics - unless he explains or justifies such possession - emphasizes petitioner's vital need for access to any material witness. P. 63. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 54]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (e) The circumstances of this case demonstrate that the informer's possible testimony was highly relevant and might have been helpful to the defense. Pp. 63-65.\n\n\n (f) On the record in this case, it cannot be assumed that the informer was known to petitioner and available to him as a witness, nor that the informer had died before the trial. P. 60, n. 8.\n\n\n (g) The trial court erred also in denying, prior to the trial, petitioner's motion for a bill of particulars, insofar as it requested the informer's identity and address, particularly because Count 1 of the indictment charged an unlawful sale of heroin to the informer. P. 65, n. 15.\n\n\n 229 F.2d 812, reversed and remanded.\n\nMaurice J. Walsh argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nJames W. Knapp argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and Julia P. Cooper.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case concerns a conviction for violation of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, as amended.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 55]\n\u00a0\n The principal issue is whether the United States District Court committed reversible error when it allowed the Government to refuse to disclose the identity of an undercover employee who had taken a material part in bringing about the possession of certain drugs by the accused, had been present with the accused at the occurrence of the alleged crime, and might be a material witness as to whether the accused knowingly transported the drugs as charged. For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that, under the circumstances here present, this was reversible error.\n\nIn 1955, in the Northern District of Illinois, petitioner, Albert Roviaro, was indicted on two counts by a federal grand jury. The first count charged that on August 12, 1954, at Chicago, Illinois, he sold heroin to one \"John Doe\" in violation of 26 U.S.C. 2554 (a). The second charged that on the same date and in the same city he \"did then and there fraudulently and knowingly receive, conceal, buy and facilitate the transportation and concealment after importation of . . . heroin, knowing the same to be imported into the United States contrary to law; in violation of Section 174, Title 21, United States Code.\"\n\nBefore trial, petitioner moved for a bill of particulars requesting, among other things, the name, address and occupation of \"John Doe.\" The Government objected on the ground that John Doe was an informer and that his identity was privileged. The motion was denied.\n\nPetitioner, who was represented by counsel, waived a jury and was tried by the District Court. During the trial John Doe's part in the charged transaction was described by government witnesses, and counsel for petitioner, in cross-examining them, sought repeatedly to learn John Doe's identity. The court declined to permit this cross-examination and John Doe was not produced, identified, or otherwise made available. Petitioner was \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 56]\n\u00a0\n found guilty on both counts and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and a fine of $5 on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.\n2\n The Court of Appeals sustained the conviction, holding that the concurrent sentence was supported by the conviction on Count 2 and that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying petitioner's requests for disclosure of Doe's identity. 229 F.2d 812. We granted certiorari, \n351 \nU.S. 936\n, in order to pass upon the propriety of the nondisclosure of the informer's identity and to consider an alleged conflict with Portomene v. United States, 221 F.2d 582; United States v. Conforti, 200 F.2d 365; and Sorrentino v. United States, 163 F.2d 627.\n\nAt the trial, the Government relied on the testimony of two federal narcotics agents, Durham and Fields, and two Chicago police officers, Bryson and Sims, each of whom knew petitioner by sight. On the night of August 12, 1954, these four officers met at 75th Street and Prairie Avenue in Chicago with an informer described only as John Doe.\n3\n Doe and his Cadillac car were searched and no narcotics were found. Bryson secreted himself in the trunk of Doe's Cadillac, taking with him a device with which to raise the trunk lid from the inside. Doe then drove the Cadillac to 70th Place and St. Lawrence Avenue, followed by Durham in one government car and Field and Sims in another. After an hour's wait, at about 11 o'clock, petitioner arrived in a Pontiac, accompanied by an unidentified \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 57]\n\u00a0\n man. Petitioner immediately entered Doe's Cadillac, taking a front seat beside Doe. They then proceeded by a circuitous route to 74th Street near Champlain Avenue. Both government cars trailed the Cadillac but only the one driven by Durham managed to follow it to 74th Street. When the Cadillac came to a stop on 74th Street, Durham stepped out of his car onto the sidewalk and saw petitioner alight from the Cadillac about 100 feet away. Durham saw petitioner walk a few feet to a nearby tree, pick up a small package, return to the open right front door of the Cadillac, make a motion as if depositing the package in the car, and then wave to Doe and walk away. Durham went immediately to the Cadillac and recovered a package from the floor. He signaled to Bryson to come out of the trunk and then walked down the street in time to see petitioner re-enter the Pontiac, parked nearby, and ride away.\n\nMeanwhile, Bryson, concealed in the trunk of the Cadillac, had heard a conversation between John Doe and petitioner after the latter had entered the car. He heard petitioner greet John Doe and direct him where to drive. At one point, petitioner admonished him to pull over to the curb, cut the motor, and turn out the lights so as to lose a \"tail.\" He then told him to continue \"further down.\" Petitioner asked about money Doe owed him. He advised Doe that he had brought him \"three pieces this time.\" When Bryson heard Doe being ordered to stop the car, he raised the lid of the trunk slightly. After the car stopped, he saw petitioner walk to a tree, pick up a package, and return toward the car. He heard petitioner say, \"Here it is,\" and \"I'll call you in a couple of days.\" Shortly thereafter he heard Durham's signal to come out and emerged from the trunk to find Durham holding a small package found to contain three glassine envelopes containing a white powder. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA field test of the powder having indicated that it contained an opium derivative, the officers, at about 12:30 a.m., arrested petitioner at his home and took him, along with Doe, to Chicago police headquarters. There petitioner was confronted with Doe, who denied that he knew or had ever seen petitioner.\n4\n Subsequent chemical analysis revealed that the powder contained heroin.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nPetitioner contends that the trial court erred in upholding the right of the Government to withhold the identity of John Doe. He argues that Doe was an active participant in the illegal activity charged and that, therefore, the Government could not withhold his identity, his whereabouts, and whether he was alive or dead at the time of trial.\n5\n The Government does not defend the nondisclosure of Doe's identity with respect to Count 1, which charged a sale of heroin to John Doe, but it attempts to sustain the judgment on the basis of the conviction \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 59]\n\u00a0\n on Count 2, charging illegal transportation of narcotics.\n6\n It argues that the conviction on Count 2 may properly be upheld since the identity of the informer, in the circumstances of this case, has no real bearing on that charge and is therefore privileged.\n\nWhat is usually referred to as the informer's privilege is in reality the Government's privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law. Scher v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 251, 254\n; In re Quarles and Butler, \n158 \nU.S. 532\n; Vogel v. Gruaz, \n110 \nU.S. 311, 316\n. The purpose of the privilege is the furtherance and protection of the public interest in effective law enforcement. The privilege recognizes the obligation of citizens to communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law-enforcement officials and, by preserving their anonymity, encourages them to perform that obligation. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 60]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe scope of the privilege is limited by its underlying purpose. Thus, where the disclosure of the contents of a communication will not tend to reveal the identity of an informer, the contents are not privileged.\n7\n Likewise, once the identity of the informer has been disclosed to those who would have cause to resent the communication, the privilege is no longer applicable.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nA further limitation on the applicability of the privilege arises from the fundamental requirements of fairness. Where the disclosure of an informer's identity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 61]\n\u00a0\n to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way.\n9\n In these situations the trial court may require disclosure and, if the Government withholds the information, dismiss the action.\n10\n Most of the federal cases involving this limitation on the scope of the informer's privilege have arisen where the legality of a search without a warrant is in issue and the communications of an informer are claimed to establish probable cause. In these cases the Government has been required to disclose the identity of the informant unless there was sufficient evidence apart from his confidential communication.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThree recent cases in the Courts of Appeals have involved the identical problem raised here - the Government's right to withhold the identity of an informer who helped to set up the commission of the crime and who was present at its occurrence. Portomene v. United States, 221 F.2d 582; United States v. Conforti, 200 F.2d 365; Sorrentino v. United States, 163 F.2d 627. In each case it was stated that the identity of such an informer must be disclosed whenever the informer's testimony \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 62]\n\u00a0\n may be relevant and helpful to the accused's defense.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nWe believe that no fixed rule with respect to disclosure is justifiable. The problem is one that calls for balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual's right to prepare his defense. Whether a proper balance renders nondisclosure erroneous must depend on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer's testimony, and other relevant factors.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe materiality of John Doe's possible testimony must be determined by reference to the offense charged in Count 2 and the evidence relating to that count. The \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 63]\n\u00a0\n charge is in the language of the statute. It does not charge mere possession; it charges that petitioner did \"fraudulently and knowingly receive, conceal, buy and facilitate the transportation and concealment after importation of . . . heroin, knowing the same to be imported into the United States contrary to law . . . .\" While John Doe is not expressly mentioned, this charge, when viewed in connection with the evidence introduced at the trial, is so closely related to John Doe as to make his identity and testimony highly material.\n\nIt is true that the last sentence of subdivision (c) of 2 authorizes a conviction when the Government has proved that the accused possessed narcotics, unless the accused explains or justifies such possession.\n13\n But this statutory presumption does not reduce the offense to one of mere possession or shift the burden of proof; it merely places on the accused, at a certain point, the burden of going forward with his defense.\n14\n The fact that petitioner here was faced with the burden of explaining or justifying his alleged possession of the heroin emphasizes his vital need for access to any material witness. Otherwise, the burden of going forward might become unduly heavy.\n\nThe circumstances of this case demonstrate that John Doe's possible testimony was highly relevant and might \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 64]\n\u00a0\n have been helpful to the defense. So far as petitioner knew, he and John Doe were alone and unobserved during the crucial occurrence for which he was indicted. Unless petitioner waived his constitutional right not to take the stand in his own defense, John Doe was his one material witness. Petitioner's opportunity to cross-examine Police Officer Bryson and Federal Narcotics Agent Durham was hardly a substitute for an opportunity to examine the man who had been nearest to him and took part in the transaction. Doe had helped to set up the criminal occurrence and had played a prominent part in it. His testimony might have disclosed an entrapment. He might have thrown doubt upon petitioner's identity or on the identity of the package. He was the only witness who might have testified to petitioner's possible lack of knowledge of the contents of the package that he \"transported\" from the tree to John Doe's car. The desirability of calling John Doe as a witness, or at least interviewing him in preparation for trial, was a matter for the accused rather than the Government to decide.\n\nFinally, the Government's use against petitioner of his conversation with John Doe while riding in Doe's car particularly emphasizes the unfairness of the nondisclosure in this case. The only person, other than petitioner himself, who could controvert, explain or amplify Bryson's report of this important conversation was John Doe. Contradiction or amplification might have borne upon petitioner's knowledge of the contents of the package or might have tended to show an entrapment.\n\nThis is a case where the Government's informer was the sole participant, other than the accused, in the transaction charged. The informer was the only witness in a position to amplify or contradict the testimony of government witnesses. Moreover, a government witness testified that Doe denied knowing petitioner or ever having \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 65]\n\u00a0\n seen him before. We conclude that, under these circumstances, the trial court committed prejudicial error in permitting the Government to withhold the identity of its undercover employee in the face of repeated demands by the accused for his disclosure.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner also presents a claim of error arising out of a controversy over the correctness of an entry, made on the envelope containing the heroin, to the effect that the heroin had been found by Bryson. The undisputed testimony of the officers was that the heroin had been found by Durham and handed by him to Bryson who, in turn, handed it to Fields who made the erroneous entry. On the basis of this discrepancy, petitioner sought to obtain Durham's written report to the Federal Narcotics Bureau concerning the case. Although this discrepancy dealt with the relatively minor matter of who had first found the package, it also reflected upon the credibility of Durham and Fields, two of the Government's principal witnesses. However, in view of the decision we have reached on other grounds, we deem it unnecessary to determine whether the denial of this request, even if erroneous, was prejudicial to petitioner. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 66]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK and MR.

In either situation, whatever privilege the Government might have had would have ceased to exist, since the purpose of the privilege is to maintain the Government's channels of communication by shielding the identity of an informer from those who would have cause to resent his conduct. The Government suggests that if petitioner knew John Doe's identity, the court's failure to require disclosure would not be prejudicial even if erroneous. See Sorrentino v. United States, 163 F.2d 627. However, any indications that petitioner, at the time of the trial, was aware of John Doe's identity are contradicted by the testimony of Officer Bryson that John Doe at police headquarters denied knowing, or ever having seen, petitioner. The trial court made no factual finding that petitioner knew Doe's identity. On this record we cannot assume that John Doe was known to petitioner, and, if alive, available to him as a witness. Nor can we conclude that John Doe died before the trial.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See, e. g., Scher v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 251\n; Wilson v. United States, 59 F.2d 390; Centoamore v. Nebraska, 105 Neb. 452, 181 N. W. 182. Early decisions established that the scope of the privilege was in the discretion of the trial judge. Disclosure was compelled when he found it \"material to the ends of justice . . . .\" Regina v. Richardson, 3 F. & F. 693, 694 (1863). See also, Marks v. Beyfus, L. R. 25 Q. B. D. 494, 498 (1890). In the Scher case, supra, at 254, this Court said that \"public policy forbids disclosure of an informer's identity unless essential to the defense, as, for example, where this turns upon an officer's good faith.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See United States v.

Agents overheard the informer make arrangements with the accused, saw the informer meet the accused and a package transferred, and then received from the informer a package containing counterfeit money. The Seventh Circuit stated that the accused would have been entitled to disclosure of the informer's identity if a proper demand had been made at the trial.\n\nIn the Sorrentino case, supra, the accused was charged with both sale and possession of narcotics. Government agents saw the accused go into a house with the informer after arrangements for a sale had been overheard, and the informer later turned over narcotics to the agents. The Ninth Circuit stated that the accused was entitled to disclosure under these circumstances, but the conviction was affirmed on the ground that the record demonstrated that the accused knew the identity of the informer.\n\nSee also, Crosby v. Georgia, 90 Ga. App. 63, 82 S. E. 2d 38.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See n. 1, supra, where the material part of the statutory provision is quoted in full.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Casey v.

He argues that its failure to do so here entitles him to an acquittal. That contention, however, has been decided against petitioner in the cases cited above.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Thus far we have dealt largely with the trial court's refusal, at the trial, to require disclosure of the informer's identity. In view of the Government's exclusive reliance here upon Count 2, we have considered this question only with respect to that count. However, we think that the court erred also in denying, prior to the trial, petitioner's motion for a bill of particulars, insofar as it requested John Doe's identity and address. Since Count 1 was then before the court and expressly charged petitioner with a sale of heroin to John Doe, it was evident from the face of the indictment that Doe was a participant in and a material witness to that sale. Accordingly, when his name and address were thus requested, the Government should have been required to supply that information or suffer dismissal of that count.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nIt is with regret that I dissent from the opinion of the Court, not because I am alone, but for the reason that I have been unable to convince the majority of the unsoundness of its conclusion on the facts here and the destructive effect which that conclusion will have on the enforcement of the narcotic laws. The short of it is that the conviction of a self-confessed dope peddler is reversed because the Government refused to furnish the name of its informant whose identity the undisputed evidence indicated was well known to the peddler. Yet the Court reverses on the ground of \"unfairness\" because of the Government's failure to perform this fruitless gesture. In my view this does violence to the common understanding of what is fair and just.\n\nFirst, it is well to remember that the illegal traffic in narcotic drugs poses a most serious social problem. One need only read the newspapers to gauge its enormity. No crime leads more directly to the commission of other offenses. Moreover, it is a most difficult crime to detect and prove. Because drugs come in small pills or powder and are readily packaged in capsules or glassine containers, they may be easily concealed. They can be carried on the person or even in the body crevasses where detection is almost impossible. Enforcement is, therefore, most difficult without the use of \"stool pigeons\" or informants. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 67]\n\u00a0\n Their use has long had the approval of the courts. To give them protection governments have always followed a policy of nondisclosure of their identities. Experience teaches that once this policy is relaxed - even though the informant be dead - its effectiveness is destroyed. Once an informant is known the drug traffickers are quick to retaliate. Dead men tell no tales. The old penalty of tongue removal, once visited upon the informer Larunda, has been found obsolete.\n\nOf course where enforcement of a nondisclosure policy deprives an accused of a fair trial it must either be relaxed or the prosecution must be foregone. The Government is fully aware of this dilemma and solves it every day by foregoing prosecutions in many cases where evidence essential to the defense would require disclosure. But this is not such a case.\n\nIn note 8 of the majority opinion, ante, p. 60, the Court makes much of testimony of a police officer that the informant, while at the police station, \"denied knowing, or ever having seen, petitioner.\" I submit that this testimony is taken out of its proper setting. The informant was in custody when petitioner was arrested and the two were taken to the police station where each was kept in custody overnight. There, while in custody, they were interrogated together about the occurrences leading up to the arrests. The federal officer present at the time was questioned at the trial in regard to informant's answers at the station:\n\n  \"Q. As a matter of fact, [the informant] said he did not have a transaction with him, didn't he, in Roviaro's presence?\n\n\n \"A. Do you want the entire conversation?\n\n\n \"Q. Isn't what I asked you a fact?\n\n\n \"A. No, sir. He didn't deny it. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 68]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"Q. Didn't [the informant] say he didn't even know him?\n\n\n \"A. Yes, sir; at first he did.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n In proper context this merely shows that the informant was carrying out a pretense that he too was arrested, was involved, and was not \"squealing.\" In fact, officer Bryson attempted in his testimony to explain the \"purpose\" of the informant in so answering but was prevented by petitioner's counsel.\n\nMoreover, the uncontradicted evidence is that the petitioner knew the informant and had associated with him for some time. Two officers testified that they had seen petitioner on June 22, 1954, enter the informant's car on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Another saw informant and petitioner enter the latter's home together on June 28, only six weeks prior to the events in question here. Further testimony shows that the informant was indebted to the petitioner, that the petitioner had telephoned several times to informant's home and \"at the place,\" that petitioner was going to call again in a couple of days after the date of his arrest, and that he entered informant's car on the night of the arrest and drove around with him for several miles. The Court asserts that the conversation between the informant and petitioner while on this ride \"emphasizes the unfairness of the nondisclosure in this case.\" But if we limit the officer's testimony to the statements of petitioner alone, the testimony would prove the intimacy of the acquaintance between petitioner and the informant. It would show that petitioner directed the informant to the cache and admonished him to turn out the car lights because of a \"tail\"; that petitioner knew \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 69]\n\u00a0\n how to reach informant by telephone and had tried to phone him; that he had brought him \"three pieces this time,\" indicating prior sales; that informant was indebted to him; that when they approached the cache he directed the informant to stop the car; and that finally when he returned with the narcotics, petitioner said \"Here it is, I'll call you in a couple of days.\" All of this testimony was admissible against petitioner whether the informant was available or not or whether he was dead or alive. It proves beyond question that the two were closely acquainted. For the Court to conclude in the face of such a record that petitioner did not know the informant is to me fantastic.\n\nBut this is not all. The petitioner has not mentioned a single substantial ground essential to his defense which would make it necessary for the Government to name the informer. The Court mentions that there might have been entrapment. Petitioner not only failed to claim entrapment but his counsel appears to have rejected any suggestion of it in open court. I submit the Court should not raise it for him here. It should be noted that petitioner's counsel stated in open court that petitioner knew the informant and believed he was dead.\n2\n Were there \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 70]\n\u00a0\n necessity to establish informant's identity or, if dead, his death, petitioner could easily have done so.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nIn truth, it appears that petitioner hoped that the Government would not furnish the name for, if the informant was dead as he believed, petitioner's ground was cut from under him. If the informant was living he knew that even though his testimony was favorable it would not be sufficient to overcome the presumption of the statute. In fact, a casual reading of the record paints a picture of one vainly engaging in trial tactics rather than searching for real defenses - shadowboxing with the prosecution in a baseless attempt to get a name that he already had but in reality hoping to get a reversible error that was nowhere else in sight. We should not encourage such tactics.\n\nIn light of these facts the rule announced by the Court in note 8 of the opinion should be applied, i. e., that the trial \"court's failure to require disclosure would not be prejudicial even if erroneous. See Sorrentino v. United States, 163 F.2d 627.\"\n\nThe position of the Court is that since the trial judge made no finding that petitioner knew the informant, the Government cannot successfully assert harmless error. It is true that the Court made no finding other than that of guilt. But this general finding is entitled to the support of every reasonable presumption. It would be reasonable to assume that the trial judge declined to order the disclosure because petitioner's counsel had said in open court that he knew the identity of the informant. Furthermore, petitioner has made no showing of how he \n\n[353 \nU.S. 53, 71]\n\u00a0\n was harmed by the nondisclosure - indeed he introduced no evidence of anything.\n\nI come now to the necessary proof required for a finding of guilt under Count 2. All that is necessary here is proof of possession of unstamped narcotics, such as heroin. The direct, uncontroverted evidence of possession, as well as transportation, is in the record. Two officers, one a local policeman and the other a regular federal narcotics agent, saw petitioner when he had in his hand a package containing heroin. The package was unstamped. A third officer saw petitioner leave the scene of his crime, get into his car, and ride away. The identification by each of the three is positive and stands uncontradicted. Under the Narcotic Drugs Act, 65 Stat. 767, 21 U.S.C. 174, this alone is prima facie evidence of guilt. Petitioner did not rebut it. In this connection it is well to point out petitioner's statement soon after his arrest. The officers asked him: \"Are you going to take this [rap] by yourself or are you going to name your connection?\" Petitioner replied that they were wasting their time - \"There's no use asking me about anybody else. . . . I don't want to get anybody else in trouble. You got me. I've stood up twice before and I can stand up again. Besides that, you've got to convict me anyhow.\" (Emphasis added.) In view of this, I submit that there is no question of guilt involved here.\n\nFeeling as I do that the opinion of the Court seriously jeopardizes the privilege of the Government in cases involving informers, that their use in narcotic cases is an absolute necessity in the proper administration of the narcotic laws, and that the disclosure required here today is not only unessential to the petitioner's defense but on the other hand undermines a long-standing policy necessary to the successful enforcement of the narcotic laws, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] On petitioner's objection this testimony was subsequently stricken. However, police officer Bryson during cross-examination provided substantially this same testimony and the inadvertence of the Government in failing to object permitted it to stand.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The record discloses the following colloquy between petitioner's counsel, Mr. Walsh, and the court:\n\n\"Mr. Walsh: Your Honor, this is the point, actually: He has testified that John Doe [the informant] was present at 11th and State Street with the Defendant.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner is an alien who has been ordered deported by virtue of 22 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 987, 1006,\n1\n for past membership in the Communist Party. He attacks the judgment below on the ground - the only claim we need to consider - that he was not a \"member\" of the Communist Party within the scope of that section.\n\nPetitioner is an alien who entered the United States in 1914 and, except for a short interval in Canada, has resided here continuously. The finding of \"membership\" by the hearing officer rested on petitioner's own testimony. He stated that he joined the Communist Party in \"the spring or summer of 1935,\" paid dues, \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 117]\n\u00a0\n attended meetings, and remained a member \"until I got arrested [in deportation proceedings] and that was at the end of 1935. When I was arrested, I finished the Communist Party membership . . . .\" At a later point in his testimony, petitioner stated that he was probably a member for approximately one year.\n\nHe then explained his reasons for joining the Communist Party:\n\n \"The purpose was probably this - it seemed to me that it came hand in hand - the Communist Party and the fight for bread. It seemed to me like this - let's put it this way - that the Communist Party and the Workers' Alliance had one aim - to get something to eat for the people. I didn't know it was against the law for aliens to join the Communist Party and the Workers' Alliance. . . .\"\n\n\n In response to a question whether his joining the Communist Party was \"motivated by dissatisfaction in living under a democracy,\" the following colloquy took place:\n\n \"A. No, not by that. Just a matter of having no jobs at that time. Everybody around me had the idea that we had to fight for something to eat and clothes and shelter. We were not thinking then - anyways the fellows around me, of overthrowing anything. We wanted something to eat and something to crawl into.\n\n\n \"Q. You say `fight for something to eat and crawl into.' What do you mean by that term?\n\n\n \"A. We had to go and ask those who had it - that was the courthouse at that time. We petitioned city, state and national government. We did and we succeeded. We finally got unemployment laws and a certain budget. Even at the few communist meetings I attended, nothing was ever said about overthrowing \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 118]\n\u00a0\n anything. All they talked about was fighting for the daily needs. That is why we never thought much of joining those parties in those days.\"\n\n\n The other activity bearing on petitioner's membership in the Communist Party was discussed in the following colloquy:\n\n \"Q. Were you an active worker in the Communist Party?\n\n\n \"A. The only active work I did was running the bookstore for a while.\n\n\n  .  .  . .  .\n\n\n \"Q. What sort of bookstore was it?\n\n\n \"A. Oh, all kinds of literature - all kinds of writers in the whole world - Strachey, Marx, Lenin's writing and others. Socialism and all that stuff.\n\n\n \"Q. Did you own the bookstore?\n\n\n \"A. No. I didn't get a penny there.\n\n\n \"Q. What was the arrangement there?\n\n\n \"A. I was kind of a salesman in there, but the Communist Party ran it.\n\n\n \"Q. You secured this employment through your membership in the Communist Party?\n\n\n \"A. Yes.\n\n\n \"Q. Was this store an official outlet for communist literature?\n\n\n \"A. Yes.\"\n\n\n Petitioner testified that he never advocated change of government by force or violence and he also gave his unilluminating understanding of, and beliefs about, the principles of communism. His account of the circumstances and motives that led him to join the Communist Party stood unchallenged and was evidently accepted at face value.\n\nThis testimony was all given during an examination of petitioner by the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 119]\n\u00a0\n in 1947. At the hearing below, in 1951, petitioner refused to answer whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party on the ground that the answers might incriminate him. The hearing officer found, from the evidence in the record, that petitioner \"was a member of the Communist Party of the United States in 1935.\" On appeal, to both the Assistant Commissioner, Adjudications Division of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and subsequently the Board of Immigration Appeals, this finding was held supported by the record. Petitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus from the District Court for the District of Minnesota. Both the District Court and, on appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the evidence produced at the hearing was sufficient to sustain the finding that petitioner was a \"member\" of the Communist Party. 228 F.2d 109. As the case involves an application of Galvan v. Press, \n347 \nU.S. 522\n, we granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 993\n.\n\nThe authority for the order deporting petitioner derives from the Internal Security Act of 1950, as amended by the Act of March 28, 1951, 65 Stat. 28. As indicated, its evidentiary support rests entirely on petitioner's testimony before an immigration inspector in 1947. The transcript of that hearing was the foundation of the administrative proceedings that resulted in the order now under review. The adequacy of that testimony to sustain the order must be judged by the Internal Security Act of 1950, which was amended by 1 of the Act of March 28, 1951, 65 Stat. 28, set forth in the margin.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 120]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs pointed out in Galvan v. Press, supra, at 527, the legislative history of this amendatory statute shows that the three specified qualifications are not to be applied as narrow exceptions but are to be considered as illustrative of the spirit in which the rigorous provisions regarding deportability of 22 (2) are to be construed. There must be a substantial basis for finding that an alien committed himself to the Communist Party in consciousness that he was \"joining an organization known as the Communist Party which operates as a distinct and active political organization . . . .\" \n347 \nU.S., at 528\n.\n\nBearing in mind the solidity of proof that is required for a judgment entailing the consequences of deportation, particularly in the case of an old man who has lived in this country for forty years, cf. Ng Fung Ho v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, we cannot say that the unchallenged account given by petitioner of his relations to the Communist Party establishes the kind of meaningful association required by the alleviating Amendment of 1951 as expounded by its sponsor, Senator McCarran, and his legislative collaborator, Senator Ferguson. (See 97 Cong. Rec. 2368 and 2387.) All that the Immigration authorities went on is what the petitioner himself said, for his truthfulness was not called into question. From his own testimony in 1947, which is all there is, the dominating impulse to his \"affiliation\" with the Communist Party may well have been wholly devoid of any \"political\" implications. To be sure, he was a \"salesman\" in a Communist book store, but he \"didn't get a penny there.\" \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 121]\n\u00a0\n Presumably he had to live on something and further inquiry might have elicited that he was getting the necessities of life for his work in the book store. Nor is there a hint in the record that this was not a bona fide book shop.\n\nAccordingly, we are of the opinion that the record before us is all too insubstantial to support the order of deportation. The differences on the facts between Galvan v. Press, supra, and this case are too obvious to be detailed.\n\n     Judgment reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That section amended the Act of October 16, 1918, 40 Stat. 1012, as amended, to provide:\n\n\"[Sec. 1] That any alien who is a member of any one of the following classes shall be excluded from admission into the United States:\n\n .  .   .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"(2) Aliens who, at any time, shall be or shall have been members of any of the following classes:\n\n .  .   .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"(C) Aliens who are members of or affiliated with (i) the Communist Party of the United States . . . .\n\n .  .   .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"SEC. 4. (a) Any alien who was at the time of entering the United States, or has been at any time thereafter, . . . a member of any one of the classes of aliens enumerated in section 1 (2) of this Act, shall, upon the warrant of the Attorney General, be taken into custody and deported in the manner provided in the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917. The provisions of this section shall be applicable to the classes of aliens mentioned in this Act, irrespective of the time of their entry into the United States.\"\n\n\n The substance of the relevant portion of this provision was incorporated in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 205, 8 U.S.C. 1251 (a) (6) (C).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Attorney General is hereby authorized and directed to provide by regulations that the terms `members of' and `affiliated with' where used in the Act of October 16, 1918, as amended, shall include only membership or affiliation which is or was voluntary, and shall not include membership or affiliation which is or was solely (a) when under \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 120]\n\u00a0\n sixteen years of age, (b) by operation of law, or (c) for purposes of obtaining employment, food rations, or other essentials of living, and where necessary for such purposes.\" See 16 Fed. Reg. 2907. These three exclusions from the substantive provision were, so far as deportations are concerned, repealed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 280; however, as the text of this opinion makes clear, we are not deciding this case on the basis of (c), supra.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON, MR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nI regret my inability to join the Court's opinion, for its effort to find a way out from the rigors of a severe statute has alluring appeal. The difficulty is that in order to reach its result the Court has had to take impermissible liberties with the statute and the record upon which this case is based.\n\nSection 22 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, under which these proceedings were brought, provides for the deportation of aliens who at the time of entry into the United States, or thereafter, were \"members of or affiliated with . . . the Communist Party of the United States . . . .\"\n1\n In this case there is no dispute that the petitioner was a dues-paying member of the Communist Party for about a year after he entered the United States. The Court, however, finds the record insufficient to establish that petitioner's membership was \"the kind of meaningful association required by the alleviating Amendment of 1951,\" and suggests that \"the dominating impulse to his `affiliation' with the Communist Party may well have been wholly devoid of any `political' implications.\" \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 122]\n\u00a0\n This holding is derived from the Act of March 28, 1951, which amended the Internal Security Act by exempting from the broad sweep of the membership provision those persons who joined the Party \"(a) when under sixteen years of age, (b) by operation of law, or (c) for purposes of obtaining employment, food rations, or other essentials of living, and where necessary for such purposes.\"\n2\n The Court does not rely here upon any of these exemptions as such, but rests its decision on its finding in Galvan v. Press, \n347 \nU.S. 522, 527\n, that the legislative discussion of these exemptions indicates that the membership provision of the 1950 Act should be read benignly.\n\nThe Court's holding as to the insufficiency of this record may be interpreted in one of two ways, either (a) that petitioner was not shown to have joined the Communist Party conscious of its character as a political organization, or (b) that if he did so join, his membership was nonetheless excusable under the 1950 Act because it was predominantly motivated by economic necessity.\n\nUnder either view of the Court's opinion I think that the setting aside of this deportation order cannot be reconciled with the holding in Galvan v. Press, supra. There the Court, in rejecting the contention that the statute should be interpreted as not reaching persons who joined or remained members of the Communist Party without knowledge of its tenets of force and violence,\n3\n said, p. 528: \"It is enough that the alien joined the Party, aware that he was joining an organization known as the Communist Party which operates as a distinct and active political organization, and that he did so of his own free will.\" I need not retrace the reasoning which \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 123]\n\u00a0\n inescapably led the Court to that decision,\n4\n save to note one point not alluded to in the Galvan opinion, namely, that the ameliorating amendment of the 1951 Act, on whose \"spirit\" the Court here relies, was motivated solely by the problems of aliens who were being excluded from entry into the United States because they had joined totalitarian organizations in foreign countries.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 124]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the first possible view of the Court's opinion it is plain that the petitioner is deportable, for in my judgment the record leaves no room for the conclusion that he was \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 125]\n\u00a0\n unaware that the Communist Party was \"a distinct and active political organization.\" The petitioner has freely admitted that he was a member of the Party for about a year; that he paid Party dues; that he attended Party meetings; and that he worked, without pay, in the Party bookstore, which he recognized as \"an official outlet for communist literature.\" Beyond this, petitioner's testimony betrayed considerable, albeit rudimentary, knowledge of Communist history and philosophy. To be sure, he disclaimed belief in the forcible overthrow of government, but that, as Galvan holds, is immaterial under this statute.\n\nPerhaps it should be added that I do not understand the Court to suggest that, although petitioner joined the Communist Party aware that it was a political organization, his activities in the Party were too slight to constitute him a \"member\" within the meaning of the 1950 Act. The Court's reaffirmation of the Galvan definition of membership would seem to preclude such an interpretation of the opinion. Moreover, that interpretation would do violence to the sweeping and unequivocal language of the Act itself.\n\nThe Court says that the \"differences on the facts between Galvan v. Press . . . and this case are too obvious to be detailed.\" But, in respect to the crucial question whether conscious membership in the Communist Party as a political organization was sufficiently shown, I submit that this record is at least as strong as that in Galvan. A \"detailing\" of the record before us will demonstrate this, and I have therefore liberally quoted from it in the Appendix to this opinion, post, p. 127.\n\nThe second possible ground of the Court's decision is equally foreclosed by Galvan. For if the record shows, as I believe it plainly does, that the petitioner joined the Communist Party of the United States of his own free will, and knowing it to be \"a distinct and active political \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 126]\n\u00a0\n organization,\" the 1950 Act makes his economic motives for joining just as irrelevant as the absence of proof that he did not believe in the violent overthrow of government.\n\nThe Court's action in this case calls to mind what Mr. Justice Cardozo said in Anderson v. Wilson, \n289 \nU.S. 20, 27\n: \"We do not pause to consider whether a statute differently conceived and framed would yield results more consonant with fairness and reason. We take the statute as we find it.\" Again, with specific reference to the statute here involved, this Court said in Galvan, p. 528: \"A fair reading of the legislation requires that this scope [see ante, p. 122] be given to what Congress enacted in 1950, however severe the consequences and whatever view one may have of the wisdom of the means which Congress employed to meet its desired end.\" I fear that the Court has departed from those wise precepts in this instance.\n\nMy view of this case would require us to deal with petitioner's contention that the statute, as applied to him, is unconstitutional. Since the Court does not reach that question, no extended discussion of it seems appropriate in a dissenting opinion. It is enough to say that I regard petitioner's constitutional argument foreclosed by Galvan v. Press, supra, Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, \n342 \nU.S. 580\n, and by the considerations and long line of authorities to which those cases refer. Whatever may be the scope of the limitations of the Fifth Amendment upon the deportation power (see Galvan, at pp. 530-531) - a question as to which I reserve the right to speak when occasion arises - I think that there is no constitutional bar to the statute as applied in this case.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons I would affirm the judgment below. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 127]\n\u00a0\n\n\n  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE    HARLAN, DISSENTING.\n\n\n   EXCERPTS FROM THE RECORD.\n\n\n After being warned of his rights, petitioner went on to say:\n\n \"I told you just now. I don't want to give testimony whatsoever on that Communist stuff again. That is finished for me as far as I am concerned. I am telling you that I have been working here 32 years - since 1914, and you can ask me what kind of work you are doing, how much wages you are getting, does your boss like you, but I don't want to be asked anything else about politics because I am not interested. I am too old to be interested. I am not interested whether the Republicans get in office, or the Democrats, or the Communists, or the Socialists. I do not want anything else to be asked because I don't want to be in this country. I am just in this country for the people's benefit. I am working and paying taxes all the time for them. Why should I go through this and get trapped through your questioning? I do not want to be asked anything about politics. It is 10 years ago now. I don't care what they have in their minds. I don't want to answer any trapping questions. If they don't want me in this country, they can take me and ship me any time.\"\n\n\n Thereafter the following occurred, omitting certain portions of the record of no significance here and the testimony already quoted by the Court that related to petitioner's disclaimer of belief in the forcible overthrow of government:\n\n \"Q. Are you a member of any organizations or societies of any kind at the present time? \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 128]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"A. Yes, I belong to the A. F. L. Local No. 665, Miscellaneous Hotel & Restaurant Workers.\n\n\n \"Q. To what organizations have you belonged in the past?\n\n\n \"A. In the past, the Workers' Alliance, the Communist Party.\n\n\n \"Q. When did you join the Workers' Alliance?\n\n\n \"A. In the spring or summer of 1935, I joined both the Workers' Alliance and the Communist Party.\n\n\n \"Q. Where did you join these organizations?\n\n\n \"A. In Minneapolis.\n\n\n \"Q. Did you hold any office in either of these organizations?\n\n\n \"A. Not in the Communist Party but in the Workers' Alliance, I was on the Executive Board, and once in a while I was secretary for some local.\n\n\n \"Q. What - the purpose of your joining the Communist Party at that time?\n\n\n \"A. We had no books then, just paid dues, and somebody collected.\n\n\n \"Q. Did you carry a party dues book at that time?\n\n\n \"A. No, but in the Workers' Alliance we had dues books.\n\n\n \"Q. Did you carry a Communist Party card at that time?\n\n\n \"A. I don't think we had cards at all.\n\n\n \"Q. For how long were you a member of the Communist Party?\n\n\n \"A. From then on until I got arrested and that was at the end of 1935. When I was arrested, I finished the Communist Party membership, but I stayed in the Workers' Alliance.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Q. What were your political beliefs at the time you joined the Communist Party? \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 129]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"A. My political beliefs were always somewhat for the benefit of most of the people - always for the benefit to help most of the people.\n\n\n \"Q. Apparently you were a member of the Communist Party for approximately one year. Is that correct?\n\n\n \"A. Yes, probably something like that.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Q. What is your opinion of a revolution, such as occurred in Russia when the Communists obtained power?\n\n\n \"A. What is my opinion of the Russian revolution  - that is about it. As much as I know about it, the Russian revolution, in my opinion, is this. It seemed that at the end of the war of 1914, the Russian middle-class especially and the Russian soldiers were sick and tired of being double-crossed and betrayed by their generals and what not (they went in with the Germans). Russian soldiers spilled their blood running against the Germans without ammunition, and there was chaos in the country. I said middle-class  - that they organized and succeeded in over-throwing that particular leadership which was headed by the Czar. But this is my opinion. This was under the leadership of Kerensky. Seemingly, Lenin and his followers which represented more the lower peasant and factory workers, were not satisfied with this set-up, and kept on working for another revolution which finally overthrew the whole upper class in the fall of 1918, and so divorced themselves for the first time in world's history, economically and politically, from the rest of the world. That is the way I see it. That is my opinion on that.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Q. Do you feel that your beliefs in government have changed during the past ten years, that is, since \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 130]\n\u00a0\n you terminated membership in the Communist Party?\n\n\n \"A. Yes, it has changed to that extent - that I began thinking for myself instead of following somebody else telling me things. I found that nothing can be broken over a knee, and that any government that exists today has a right to exist as it is - by the power of the majority of a nation's people. Nobody in the world can say there are no changes. We must always consider changes. They can be made when the people see that it is the right time for it, and at that time they will have their representatives which will take care of it. I am absolutely against sudden dictatorship and overthrow of government.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Q. What is your opinion as to whether communism was the cause or outgrowth of the Russian revolution?\n\n\n \"A. Communism did not start the revolution. The middle-class started the revolution. Lenin got hold of it. Communism was the result of the revolution.\n\n\n \"Q. Were you an organizer for the Communist Party?\n\n\n \"A. No.\n\n\n \"Q. What is your personal belief as to the principles of communism?\n\n\n \"A. What is communism? That is a good question. My belief is a different thing than communism is. According to Marx and Lenin and as I have seen the Communists working, since I knew of them, they are aiming, more or less, with forever methods to set up an economic system to get the people out of a monopoly control on to their own economic feet. That is the way I see them working now.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 64 Stat. 987, 1006, 1008.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 65 Stat. 28.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"It must be concluded, therefore, that support, or even demonstrated knowledge, of the Communist Party's advocacy of violence was not intended to be a prerequisite to deportation.\" \n347 \nU.S., at 528\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The result reached in Galvan was thoroughly consistent both with the judicial and administrative decisions interpreting the predecessors of the 1950 Act, and with the purpose of that Act to \"strengthen\" the provisions of the law relating \"to the exclusion and deportation . . . of subversive aliens.\" See H. R. Rep. No. 3112, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 54. Compare the exhaustive treatment in Latva v. Nicolls, 106 F. Supp. 658, where Judge Wyzanski reached the same conclusion as to the meaning of the 1950 Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This conclusion is compelled by the legislative history. The House of Representatives Report on the bill embodying the amendment stated:\n\n\"The attention of the Committees on the Judiciary of both Houses has been directed to the increasing number of cases in which nonimmigrant and immigrant visas have been withheld or admission into this country denied to aliens on the basis of regulations issued pursuant to the act of October 16, 1918, as amended. The majority of the cases brought to the attention of the committees involve spouses of servicemen, close relatives of American citizens, permanent residents previously admitted into the United States and returning from abroad to their unrelinquished domiciles with appropriate documentation, such as reentry permits, etc.\n\n\n\"The reason most frequently given for the denial of visas or the denial of admission appears to be the applicant's past membership of [sic], or affiliation with, certain totalitarian youth, national labor, or professional student, or similar organizations, or the alien's service in the German or Italian Armies, or his involuntary membership in totalitarian parties or their affiliates and auxiliaries, including those cases where it was shown that such membership or affiliation occurred by operation of law or edict, or for purposes of obtaining or preserving employment, food rations, or other essentials of living.\n\n.  .  .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"The bill makes clear the intent of Congress that aliens who are, or were, voluntary members of . . . totalitarian parties or organizations are to be excluded, but aliens who were involuntary members \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 124]\n\u00a0\n . . . are not to be considered ipso facto as members of, or affiliated with, the . . . organizations within the meaning of the act of October 16, 1918, as amended.\" H. R. Rep. No. 118, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1-2. (Italics added.)\n\n\n The debates on the floor of both Houses of Congress provide additional evidence on this score. In the Senate, where the major discussion took place, every specific reference to the scope of the proposed amendment discloses that its purpose was to assist individuals who were being denied admission into the United States because of their prior membership in totalitarian organizations in their homeland. For example, Senator Smith inquired at one point: \"Would the pending bill exclude, for instance, a Ukrainian who lived in the Soviet Union and who was forced to belong to a Kulak farm cooperative in order to obtain work? Would such a man be excluded?\" 97 Cong. Rec. 2369. And Senator McCarran, the chief author of the amendment, described its three subsections in revealing detail. With respect to each he emphasized that many \"spouses of members of the United States Armed Forces\" were included. The first class, he said, consisted of persons \"who during infancy where [sic] members of the Hitler Youth, Fascist Youth, and similar organizations where the child's education and welfare were made dependent upon membership . . . .\" The second class embraced \"aliens who unwittingly, and without their knowledge or consent, were impressed into the various labor fronts and professional unions and organizations; aliens who served in the German and Italian Armies; and aliens who . . . by law or decree became members of or affiliated with subsidiary totalitarian organizations.\" And the third class, as described by Senator McCarran, consisted of \"aliens who were forced to become members of totalitarian organizations in order to obtain food ration cards, housing, employment, and other essentials of living.\" 97 Cong. Rec. 2370-2371.\n\nThe inference that Congress intended to aid only persons being denied admission to the United States rather than persons subject to deportation for membership which took place in this country is substantially reinforced by the fact that when the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 repealed the ameliorating amendment, 66 Stat. 163, 280, its substance was re-enacted as far as exclusions were concerned, 66 Stat. 186, but not with respect to deportation. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 115, 131]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nS.

With him on the brief were J. Blanc Monroe and Monte M. Lemann.\n\nDaniel James filed a brief for Middle South Utilities, Inc., respondent.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nOn January 29, 1953, the Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to 11 (b) (1) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 820, 15 U.S.C. 79k (b) (1), issued a notice and order for hearing directed \n\n[353 \nU.S. 368, 369]\n\u00a0\n to Middle South Utilities, Inc., and its subsidiary, Louisiana Power & Light Company, upon the matter of \"[w]hether Middle South and Louisiana [Power] should be required to take action to dispose of the gas utility assets and non-utility assets of Louisiana [Power] and, if so, what terms and conditions should be imposed in connection therewith.\" A copy of that notice and order for hearing was served upon those companies and also upon the Louisiana Public Service Commission by registered mail.\n\nA full hearing was conducted by the S. E. C. at which Middle South and Louisiana Power appeared, adduced evidence, and presented arguments in support of their position that they should be permitted to retain Louisiana Power's gas properties as an additional integrated public utility system under the proviso to 11 (b) (1) of the Act. The Louisiana Public Service Commission did not appear in that proceeding. On March 20, 1953, the S. E. C. issued its opinion, findings and order directing Middle South and Louisiana Power to divest themselves of all the non-electric assets of Louisiana Power \"in any appropriate manner not in contravention of the applicable provisions of the Act,\" which gave them one year for compliance under the provisions of 11 (c) of the Act, 49 Stat. 821, 15 U.S.C. 79k (c). No petition to review that order was ever filed, and it ceased to be subject to judicial review with the expiration of the 60 days allowed to petition for that purpose by 24 (a) of the Act, 49 Stat. 834, 15 U.S.C. 79x (a), on May 19, 1953.\n\nThereafter, pursuant to 11 (c) of the Act, the S. E. C. extended the time for compliance with its order to March 20, 1955. On November 10, 1954, Louisiana Power and its newly organized wholly owned subsidiary, Louisiana Gas Service Corp., filed a joint \"application-declaration\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 368, 370]\n\u00a0\n with the S. E. C., proposing the transfer by Louisiana Power of all its non-electric properties to Louisiana Gas as a step in compliance with the divestment order of March 20, 1953, and expressing the intention of Louisiana Power to effect divestment of the common stock of Louisiana Gas within 18 months from the date the latter might begin operations. Thereupon, the S. E. C. issued a notice advising interested persons, including the Louisiana Public Service Commission, of the filing of the \"application-declaration\" mentioned, and that they might request a hearing on that proposal. By telegram of December 22, 1954, the Louisiana Commission requested the S. E. C. to grant a hearing upon that \"application-declaration\" and to reopen the 11 (b) (1) proceeding which had resulted in the divestment order of March 20, 1953. On December 27, 1954, it filed with the S. E. C. a formal petition accordingly, which it supplemented on January 3, 1955. Also, at the suggestion of the S. E. C., the Louisiana Commission submitted an offer of proof and a brief in support of its petition to reopen the divestment proceeding. The offer of proof did not indicate any change in conditions since the divestment order of March 20, 1953, but, rather, complained that the evidence in that proceeding had been incomplete and that the S. E. C. had acted, in part, upon an erroneous conception of the law. The S. E. C. heard oral argument upon the Louisiana Commission's petition to reopen. Thereafter, on September 13, 1955, it found that there were \"no grounds for questioning . . . [its] earlier conclusion and no changed circumstances justifying a modification\" of its divestment order of March 20, 1953, and it denied the petition to reopen that proceeding.\n\nThe Louisiana Commission then filed a petition in the Court of Appeals to review the order of September 13, 1955, denying its petition to reopen, and also therein \n\n[353 \nU.S. 368, 371]\n\u00a0\n stated that it sought review of the divestment order of March 20, 1953. The S. E. C. moved the Court of Appeals to dismiss the petition for review upon the ground that the order of September 13, 1955, was not judicially reviewable and that the petition for review was in essence an attempt to appeal from the divestment order of March 20, 1953, long after the time allowed by law to do so had expired. The Court of Appeals held that the order of September 13, 1955, was reviewable, and it set aside that order. It also held that legal determinations made by the S. E. C. in its divestment order of March 20, 1953, were erroneous, and it, in effect, set aside that order too. 235 F.2d 167. We granted certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 924\n.\n\nThe conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the order of September 13, 1955, was subject to judicial review was rested upon the last two sentences of 11 (b) of the Act, 49 Stat. 820, 15 U.S.C. 79k (b), reading: \"The Commission may by order revoke or modify any order previously made under this subsection, if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, it finds that the conditions upon which the order was predicated do not exist. Any order made under this subsection shall be subject to judicial review as provided in section 79x of this title.\" It held that the Securities and Exchange Commission's order of September 13, 1955, denying the Louisiana Commission's petition to reopen the divestment proceeding was an \"order\" specifically made subject to judicial review by the quoted language.\n\nWe take a different view. We hold that the orders made judicially reviewable by the quoted language are the directory orders mentioned in, and authorized by, subsection (b) of 11 of the Act, and orders which may \"revoke or modify\" any such order previously made under that subsection, and that the quoted language does not include an order merely denying a petition to reopen \n\n[353 \nU.S. 368, 372]\n\u00a0\n 11 (b) proceedings. It follows that the Securities and Exchange Commission's order of September 13, 1955, denying the Louisiana Commission's petition to reopen the divestment proceeding was not an order which was subject to judicial review, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals must accordingly be reversed.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE CLARK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 368, 373]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAN DIEGO UNIONS v.

Petitioner unions asked respondents to sign a labor contract including a union shop provision, though the unions had not been selected by a majority of respondents' employees as their bargaining agents. Respondents refused to sign and the unions commenced peaceful picketing and secondary pressure to enforce their demand.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nRespondents are a partnership, operating two retail lumber yards in San Diego County, California. In the year before this proceeding began they purchased more than $250,000 worth of material from outside of California for resale at retail. Petitioner unions asked them to sign a contract including a union shop provision. Respondents refused on the ground that it would be a violation of the National Labor Relations Act to sign such a contract before a majority of their employees had selected a union as their collective bargaining agent. The unions commenced peaceful picketing to enforce their demand. About a week later respondents filed suit in the Superior Court for an injunction and damages, alleging that they were in interstate commerce and that the contract sought by the unions would violate the Act.\n1\n On the same day respondents filed with the National Labor Relations Board's regional office a petition asking that the question of the representation of their employees be resolved. The Regional Director dismissed the petition. The unions nevertheless pressed their claim that the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 26, 28]\n\u00a0\n National Board had exclusive jurisdiction.\n2\n After a hearing the Superior Court entered an order enjoining the unions from picketing or exerting secondary pressure in support of their demand for a union shop agreement unless and until one or another of the unions had been designated as the collective bargaining representative of respondents' employees. It also awarded respondents $1,000 damages. The California Supreme Court affirmed.\n3\n We granted certiorari. \n351 \nU.S. 923\n. Recognizing that respondents' business affected interstate commerce, it concluded that the Board's declination, in pursuance of its announced jurisdictional policy, to handle respondents' representation petition left the state courts free to act.\n4\n On the merits the court said:\n\n \"The assertion of economic pressure to compel an  employer to sign the type of agreement here involved  is an unfair labor practice under section 8 (b) (2) of  the [National Labor Relations] act. . . . Concerted  labor activities for such a purpose thus were  unlawful under the federal statute, and for that reason  were not privileged under the California law.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n What we have said in Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board, ante, p. 1, and Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Fairlawn Meats, Inc., ante, p. 20, is applicable here, and those cases control this one in its major aspects. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 26, 29]\n\u00a0\n Respondents, however, argue that the award of damages must be sustained under United Construction Workers v. Laburnum Construction Corp., \n347 \nU.S. 656\n. We do not reach this question. The California Supreme Court leaves us in doubt, but its opinion indicates that it felt bound to \"apply\" or in some sense follow federal law in this case. There is, of course, no such compulsion. Laburnum sustained an award of damages under state tort law for violent conduct. We cannot know that the California court would have interpreted its own state law to allow an award of damages in this different situation. We therefore vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Supreme Court of California for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion and the opinions in Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board, supra, and Amalgamated Meat Cutters v.

Certain shippers, receivers, and an association of manufacturers of finished granite products had testified that the existing rail service was satisfactory for the transportation of carload shipments but entirely inadequate for less-than-carload shipments, not only from the standpoint of cost but also and primarily from a service standpoint. The Commission based its denial of the application on the grounds that the rail service was \"reasonably adequate,\" that the main purpose of these witnesses in supporting the application was to obtain lower rates rather than improved service and that this was not a proper basis for a grant of authority. It failed to evaluate the \"inherent advantages\" of the proposed motor service, including whatever benefit might be determined to exist from the standpoint of rates, and its findings as to the adequacy of the rail service were not sufficient to provide a basis for determining whether its decision comported with the National Transportation Policy.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe issue in this case is whether the Interstate Commerce Commission adequately and correctly applied the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 85]\n\u00a0\n standards of the National Transportation Policy in denying a motor carrier's application to provide service between points now served exclusively by rail. The applicant, A. W. Schaffer, a common carrier by motor doing business as Schaffer Transportation Co., holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing him to transport granite from Grant County, South Dakota, to points in 15 States. In the present application he sought additional authority under 207 (a) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1940,\n1\n to transport granite from Grant County to various new points as well as authority to transport from points in Vermont to several States in the Midwest and South.\n2\n From all that appears in the Commission's report, rail service is currently the only mode of transportation available to shippers of granite between the points sought to be served by Schaffer.\n\nThe evidence adduced to demonstrate the need for Schaffer's service came from three shippers, six receivers \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 86]\n\u00a0\n and an association composed primarily of Vermont manufacturers of finished granite products. Their evidence, as summarized in the report of Division 5 of the Commission, disclosed the following advantages to be gained from motor carrier service:\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\"They all agree that [existing rail] service, in the main, is satisfactory for the transportation of carload shipments but entirely inadequate for the transportation of less-than-carload shipments, not only from the standpoint of cost, but also and primarily from a service standpoint. In this respect, the record shows that on movements of small shipments the supporting witnesses have experienced delays, damage to their merchandise, and have been hampered to some degree by the lack or insufficiency of rail sidings. In many instances, they have been asked by customers to furnish delivery by motor carrier but because of the lack of such service they have been unable to comply with these requests. Moreover, and no less important from a business point of view, the shippers are faced with the competitive disadvantage of having to compete with producers of granite at other locations which have truck delivery available. Then, too, the lack of truck service has impeded shippers' ability to increase their sales and expand their markets in this area. By use of the proposed service, certain other benefits also would accrue to the shippers or dealers. For example, the latter would be able to maintain lower inventories, receive their freight faster and more frequently, and thus, be able better to meet erection deadlines, \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 87]\n\u00a0\n especially during the peak seasons. Furthermore, the amount of crating now necessary would be reduced with resultant savings in time and money.\"\n\n\n Relying on these factors, Division 5 approved the application, but the full Commission reconsidered the application on the same record, and, with four Commissioners dissenting, ordered it denied. A. W. Schaffer Extension - Granite, 63 M. C. C. 247. Schaffer brought an action before a statutory three-judge court under 49 U.S.C. 305 (g) to set the order aside. The District Court denied relief and ordered the complaint dismissed. 139 F. Supp. 444. The case is here on direct appeal.\n4\n 28 U.S.C. 1253, 2101 (b). We noted probable jurisdiction. \n352 \nU.S. 923\n.\n\nThe National Transportation Policy,\n5\n formulated by Congress, specifies in its terms that it is to govern the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 88]\n\u00a0\n Commission in the administration and enforcement of all provisions of the Act, and this Court has made it clear that this policy is the yardstick by which the correctness of the Commission's actions will be measured. Dixie Carriers, Inc. v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 56\n; Eastern-Central Motor Carriers Assn. v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 194\n; McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 67\n. Of course, the Commission possesses a \"wide range of discretionary authority\" in determining whether the public interest warrants certification of any particular proposed service. United States v. Detroit & Cleveland Navigation Co., \n326 \nU.S. 236, 241\n; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Parker, \n326 \nU.S. 60\n. But that discretion must be exercised in conformity with the declared policies of the Congress. To see whether those policies have been implemented we look to the Commission's own summary of the evidence, and particularly to the findings, formal or otherwise, which the Commission has made. Just as we would overstep our duty by undertaking to evaluate the evidence according to our own notions of the public interest, we would shirk our duty were we summarily to approve the Commission's evaluation of the record without determining that the agency's evaluation had been made in accordance with the mandate of Congress.\n\nThe Commission denied Schaffer's application on the following basis:\n\n \"On the foregoing facts, we are unable to conclude that the public convenience and necessity require the proposed operation. It is seen that for one reason or another the supporting witnesses find fault with the presently utilized rail service. Actually, however, \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 89]\n\u00a0\n the evidence warrants the conclusion that the witnesses are reasonably satisfied with rail service except for the one complaint that all share, namely, that rail service is too slow. Nevertheless, it is the practice for the Vermont shippers to hold finished granite until they can accumulate a pool-car load in order that the shipments may move at the lower pool-car rate. This practice is followed with the knowledge and consent of the consignees, and the sole purpose therein is to take advantage of the lower rail rate. Less-than-carload rail service, while not as expeditious as the proposed service, is fairly good, but because of the higher rate involved this service is seldom used by the supporting witnesses. The testimony of the South Dakota shipper also indicates that its support of the application is largely motivated by anticipated cheaper transportation.\n\n\n \"We have carefully considered applicant's arguments to the contrary, but are forced to conclude that the service presently available is reasonably adequate. The evidence indicates that the witnesses' main purpose in supporting the application is to obtain lower rates rather than improved service. It is well established that this is not a proper basis for a grant of authority, and the application, therefore, must be denied.\"\n\n\n Viewing these conclusions in light of the National Transportation Policy we find at the outset that there has been no evaluation made of the \"inherent advantages\" of the motor service proposed by the applicant. That policy requires the Commission to administer the Act so as to \"recognize and preserve the inherent advantages\" of each mode of transportation. Dixie Carriers, Inc. v. United States, supra; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Mechling, \n330 \nU.S. 567\n. When a motor carrier seeks to offer service where only rail transportation is presently \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 90]\n\u00a0\n authorized, the inherent advantages of the proposed service are a critical factor which the Commission must assess. How significant these advantages are in a given factual context and what need exists for a service that can supply these advantages are considerations for the Commission.\n\nRather than evaluate the benefit that Schaffer's proposed motor service might bring to the public, the Commission cast its first principal conclusion in terms of the adequacy of existing rail service, finding that service to be \"reasonably adequate.\" Yet the Commission itself has previously stated: \"That a particular point has adequate rail service is not a sufficient reason for denial of a certificate [to a motor carrier].\" Bowles Common Carrier Application, 1 M. C. C. 589, 591. Of course, adequacy of rail service is a relevant consideration, but as the Commission recognized in Metler Extension - Crude Sulphur, 62 M. C. C. 143, 148, \"relative or comparative adequacy\" of the existing service is the significant consideration when the interests of competition are being reconciled with the policy of maintaining a sound transportation system. The record here does not disclose the factors the Commission compared in concluding that existing rail service is \"reasonably adequate.\" For example, the Commission has not determined whether there are benefits that motor service would provide which are not now being provided by the rail carriers, whether certification of a motor carrier would be \"unduly prejudicial\"\n6\n to the existing carriers, and whether on balance the public interest would be better served by additional competitive service. To reject a motor carrier's application on the bare conclusion that existing rail service can move the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 91]\n\u00a0\n available traffic, without regard to the inherent advantages of the proposed service, would give one mode of transportation unwarranted protection from competition from others. As the report of Division 5 emphasizes, \"[N]o carrier is entitled to protection from competition in the continuance of a service that fails to meet a public need, nor, by the same token, should the public be deprived of a new and improved service because it may divert some traffic from other carriers.\"\n\nThe Commission's second basic conclusion from the record was that the main purpose of the witnesses in supporting the application was the prospect of obtaining lower rates. For this reason the Commission discounted the testimony of these witnesses, apparently without even evaluating the claimed advantages of the proposed service other than reduced rates. We think this approach runs counter to the National Transportation Policy. The ability of one mode of transportation to operate with a rate lower than competing types of transportation is precisely the sort of \"inherent advantage\" that the congressional policy requires the Commission to recognize. Dixie Carriers, Inc. v. United States, supra. The Commission asserts that it has always considered rates irrelevant in certification proceedings under 207 (a), yet, with but one exception, it relies on administrative decisions involving applications by a carrier to provide service to an area already served by the same mode of transportation.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 92]\n\u00a0\n Those decisions are entirely different from the situation presented here, where a motor carrier seeks to compete for traffic now handled exclusively by rail service. In these circumstances a rate benefit attributable to differences between the two modes of transportation is an \"inherent advantage\" of the competing type of carrier and cannot be ignored by the Commission.\n\nSince the Commission has failed to evaluate the benefits that Schaffer's proposed service would provide the public, including whatever benefit may be determined to exist from the standpoint of rates, and since the findings as to the adequacy of rail service do not provide this Court with a basis for determining whether the Commission's decision comports with the National Transportation Policy, that decision must be set aside, and the Commission must proceed further in light of what we have said.\n\nWe do not minimize the complexity of the task the Commission faces in evaluating and balancing the numerous considerations that collectively determine where the public interest lies in a particular situation. And we do not suggest that the National Transportation Policy is a set of self-executing principles that inevitably point the way to a clear result in each case. On the contrary, those principles overlap and may conflict, and, where this occurs, resolution is the task of the agency that is expert in the field. But there is here no indication in the Commission's findings of a conflict of policies. Shippers and receivers now served exclusively by rail have testified to the advantages they would gain from a proposed motor carrier service. There is no finding that the authorization of the proposed service would impair the sound operation of the carriers already certificated. Nor has the Commission properly evaluated the advantages urged by the supporting witnesses to determine whether the standard of public convenience and necessity has been met. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 93]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to set aside the Commission's order and remand the cause to the Commission for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 551, as amended, 54 Stat. 923, 49 U.S.C. 307 (a). Section 207 (a) of the Act provides:\n\n\"(a) Subject to section 210, a certificate shall be issued to any qualified applicant therefor, authorizing the whole or any part of the operations covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing, and able properly to perform the service proposed and to conform to the provisions of this part and the requirements, rules, and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and that the proposed service, to the extent to be authorized by the certificate, is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity; otherwise such application shall be denied . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A portion of the requested East-bound authority was opposed by a motor carrier already certificated to serve points in five of the Eastern States. This portion of the requested authority was denied by Division 5 of the Commission and is no longer in issue as Schaffer did not seek reconsideration. With this exception, the requested authority was opposed solely by railroads which presently serve the points involved.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Whether these advantages demonstrate that the public convenience and necessity required Schaffer's proposed service is not for us to say. We take note of them only to indicate that some showing of need was established.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The American Trucking Associations, Inc., was a plaintiff below and is an appellant here. The United States supported the ICC's order in the District Court but has since concluded \"on further analysis\" that the order is erroneous; the United States therefore opposed in this Court the Commission's motion to affirm and both filed a brief and presented oral argument in support of appellants.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.\n\nThe Transportation Act of 1940 (amending the Interstate Commerce Act) grants to the Interstate Commerce Commission powers and imposes limitations upon their exercise in terms of greatly varying degrees of definiteness. As a consequence, the range of discretion left to the Commission and, correspondingly, the scope of judicial review of Commission orders greatly vary. Thus, our decision this day in Nos. 6 and 8, American Trucking Associations v. United States, post, p. 141, is a striking illustration of the difference between the limitation to which the Commission is subjected in a proceeding under 5 (2) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 5 (2) (b), and the requirements of 207 of that Act, as amended by 49 Stat. 551, 49 U.S.C. 307, although both relate to motor carrier service by railroads. The Commission's power to grant relief under the undefined terms of the long-and-short-haul clause of 4 of that Act, as amended by the Mann-Elkins Act of June 18, 1910, 36 Stat. 539, 547, see Intermountain Rate Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 476\n, was modified by the specific requirements which Congress wrote into the long-and-short-haul clause in 6 of the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 904, 49 U.S.C. 4 (1). In short, some rules dealing with the regulation of surface transportation are narrowly specific, leaving practically no scope for discretion in their application by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Other provisions are expressed \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 94]\n\u00a0\n in terms which necessarily leave considerable scope in the evaluation of their implied ingredients, while still others are of such breadth as to leave even wider opportunity for an exercise of judgment by the Commission not to be displaced by a court's independent judgment under the guise of judicial review.\n\nIn the case before us, the Interstate Commerce Commission denied an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity under 207 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended. On review of this denial, the three-judge District Court sustained the Commission. This Court reverses the District Court on the ground that the Commission has failed to enforce the National Transportation Policy in 1 of the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 899, 49 U.S.C., at p. 7107. The very name of these introductory recitals to the Transportation Act illumines their legal significance: \"All of the provisions of this Act shall be administered and enforced with a view to carrying out the above declaration of policy.\" Congress thus conveyed to the Commission a most generalized point of view for carrying out its manifold, complicated and frequently elusive duties. In the very nature of things this Policy is unlike a more or less specific rule affording more or less defined criteria for application in a particular case. Still less does it afford concrete, definable criteria for judicial overturning of the Commission's conscientious attempt to translate such Policy into concreteness in a particular case.\n\nNo doubt the Commission is under obligation to heed what was declared to be \"the national transportation policy of the Congress,\" namely, \"to provide for fair and impartial regulation of all modes of transportation subject to the provisions of this Act, so administered as to recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of each.\" Surely these are not mechanical or self-defining standards. They inevitably imply the widest areas for judgment \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 95]\n\u00a0\n to be exercised, as the Commission has sought to exercise it, with the massive experience which must be attributed to it in this particular case. It is because I find myself regretfully in disagreement with my brethren regarding the nature and scope of the problem of judicial review in a case like this that I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\nIt is, however, pertinent to add that the Court's decision may serve a useful purpose if it will lead the Interstate Commerce Commission, despite its enormous volume of business, to a more detailed and illuminating formulation of the reasons for the judgment that it reaches even in that class of cases where Congress has relied on the Commission's discretion in enforcing the most broadly expressed congressional policy. Since the orders in such cases also fall under judicial scrutiny, it is desirable to insist upon precision in the findings and the reasons for the Commission's action. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 83, 96]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHWARE v.

Petitioner made a strong showing of good moral character, except that it appeared that from 1933 to 1937 he had used certain aliases, that he had been arrested (but never tried or convicted) on several occasions prior to 1940, and that from 1932 to 1940 he was a member of the Communist Party.

Pp. 233-247.\n\n (a) A State cannot exclude a person from the practice of law or from any other occupation in a manner or for reasons that contravene the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 238-239.\n\n\n (b) A State can require high standards of qualifications, such as good moral character or proficiency in its law, before it admits an applicant to the bar; but any qualification must have a rational connection with the applicant's fitness or capacity to practice law. P. 239.\n\n\n (c) Even in applying permissible standards, officers of the State cannot exclude an applicant when there is no basis for their finding that he fails to meet these standards, or when their action is invidiously discriminatory. P. 239.\n\n\n (d) Whether the practice of law is a \"right\" or a \"privilege\" need not here be determined; it is not a matter of the State's grace, and a person cannot be barred except for valid reasons. P. 239, n. 5.\n\n\n (e) Petitioner's use from 1934 to 1937 of certain aliases, for purposes which were not wrong and not to cheat or defraud, does \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 233]\n\u00a0\n not support an inference of bad moral character more than 20 years later. Pp. 240-241.\n\n\n (f) The arrests of petitioner are insufficient to support a finding that he had bad moral character at the time he applied to take the bar examination. Pp. 241-243.\n\n\n (g) Petitioner's membership in the Communist Party from 1932 to 1940 does not justify an inference that he presently has bad moral character. Pp. 243-246.\n\n\n (h) The use of aliases, the arrests, and former membership in the Communist Party do not in combination warrant exclusion of petitioner from the practice of law. P. 246.\n\n\n (i) In the light of petitioner's forceful showing of good moral character, the evidence upon which the State relies cannot be said to raise substantial doubts as to his present good moral character. P. 246.\n\n\n 60 N. M. 304, 291 P.2d 607, reversed and remanded.\n\nHerbert Monte Levy argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nWilliam A. Sloan and Fred M. Standley, Attorney General of New Mexico, argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented is whether petitioner, Rudolph Schware, has been denied a license to practice law in New Mexico in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nNew Mexico has a system for the licensing of persons to practice law similar to that in effect in most States.\n1\n A Board of Bar Examiners determines if candidates for admission to the bar have the necessary qualifications. When the Board concludes that an applicant qualifies \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 234]\n\u00a0\n it recommends to the State Supreme Court that he be admitted. If the court accepts the recommendation, the applicant is entitled to practice law upon taking an oath to support the constitutions and laws of the United States and New Mexico. An applicant must pass a bar examination before the Board will give him its recommendation. The Board can refuse to permit him to take this examination unless he demonstrates that he has \"good moral character.\"\n\nIn December 1953, on the eve of his graduation from the University of New Mexico School of Law, Schware filed an application with the Board of Bar Examiners requesting that he be permitted to take the bar examination scheduled for February 1954. His application was submitted on a form prescribed by the Board that required answers to a large number of questions. From the record, it appears that he answered these questions in detail. Among other things, he disclosed that he had used certain aliases between 1933 and 1937 and that he had been arrested on several occasions prior to 1940. When he appeared to take the examination, the Board informed him that he could not do so. He later requested a formal hearing on the denial of his application. The Board granted his request. At the hearing the Board told him for the first time why it had refused to permit him to take the bar examination. It gave him a copy of the minutes of the meeting at which it had voted to deny his application. These minutes read:\n\n  \"No. 1309, Rudolph Schware. It is moved by  Board Member Frank Andrews that the application  of Rudolph Schware to take the bar examination be  denied for the reason that, taking into consideration  the use of aliases by the applicant, his former connection  with subversive organizations, and his record  of arrests, he has failed to satisfy the Board as to the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 235]\n\u00a0\n  requisite moral character for admission to the Bar  of New Mexico. Whereupon said motion is duly  seconded by Board Member Ross L. Malone, and  unanimously passed.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n At the hearing petitioner called his wife, the rabbi of his synagogue, a local attorney and the secretary to the dean of the law school to testify about his character.\n3\n He took the stand himself and was thoroughly examined under oath by the Board. His counsel introduced a series of letters that petitioner had written his wife from 1944 through 1946 while he was on duty in the Army. Letters were also introduced from every member of petitioner's law school graduating class except one who did not comment. And all of his law school professors who were then available wrote in regard to his moral \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 236]\n\u00a0\n character. The Board called no witnesses and introduced no evidence.\n\nThe record of the formal hearing shows the following facts relevant to Schware's moral character. He was born in a poor section of New York City in 1914 and grew up in a neighborhood inhabited primarily by recent immigrants. His father was an immigrant and like many of his neighbors had a difficult time providing for his family. Schware took a job when he was nine years old and throughout the remainder of school worked to help provide necessary income for his family. After 1929, the economic condition of the Schware family and their neighbors, as well as millions of others, was greatly worsened. Schware was then at a formative stage in high school. He was interested in and enthusiastic for socialism and trade-unionism as was his father. In 1932, despairing at what he considered lack of vigor in the socialist movement at a time when the country was in the depths of the great depression, he joined the Young Communist League.\n4\n At this time he was 18 years old and in the final year of high school.\n\nFrom the time he left school until 1940 Schware, like many others, was periodically unemployed. He worked at a great variety of temporary and ill-paying jobs. In 1933, he found work in a glove factory and there he participated in a successful effort to unionize the employees. Since these workers were principally Italian, Schware assumed the name Rudolph Di Caprio to forestall the effects of anti-Jewish prejudice against him, not only in securing and retaining a job but in assisting in the organization of his fellow employees. In 1934 he went to California where he secured work on the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 237]\n\u00a0\n docks. He testified that he continued to use the name Rudolph Di Caprio because Jews were discriminated against in employment for this work. Wherever Schware was employed he was an active advocate of labor organization. In 1934 he took part in the great maritime strikes on the west coast which were bitterly fought on both sides. While on strike in San Pedro, California, he was arrested twice on \"suspicion of criminal syndicalism.\" He was never formally charged nor tried and was released in each instance after being held for a brief period. He testified that the San Pedro police in a series of mass arrests jailed large numbers of the strikers.\n\nAt the time of his father's death in 1937 Schware left the Communist Party but later he rejoined. In 1940 he was arrested and indicted for violating the Neutrality Act of 1917. He was charged with attempting to induce men to volunteer for duty on the side of the Loyalist Government in the Spanish Civil War. Before his case came to trial the charges were dismissed and he was released. Later in 1940 he quit the Communist Party. The Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of 1939 had greatly disillusioned him and this disillusionment was made complete as he came to believe that certain leaders in the Party were acting to advance their own selfish interests rather than the interests of the working class which they purported to represent.\n\nIn 1944 Schware entered the armed forces of the United States. While in the service he volunteered for duty as a paratrooper and was sent to New Guinea. While serving in the Army here and abroad he wrote a number of letters to his wife. These letters show a desire to serve his country and demonstrate faith in a free democratic society. They reveal serious thoughts about religion which later led him and his wife to associate themselves with a synagogue when he returned to civilian \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 238]\n\u00a0\n life. He was honorably discharged from the Army in 1946.\n\nAfter finishing college, he entered the University of New Mexico law school in 1950. At the beginning he went to the dean and told him of his past activities and his association with the Communist Party during the depression and asked for advice. The dean told him to remain in school and put behind him what had happened years before. While studying law Schware operated a business in order to support his wife and two children and to pay the expenses of a professional education. During his three years at the law school his conduct was exemplary.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the Board reaffirmed its decision denying Schware the right to take the bar examination. He appealed to the New Mexico Supreme Court. That court upheld the denial with one justice dissenting. 60 N. M. 304, 291 P.2d 607. In denying a motion for rehearing the court stated that:\n\n\"[Schware's membership in the Communist Party], together with his other former actions in the use of aliases and record of arrests, and his present attitude toward those matters, were the considerations upon which [we approved the denial of his application].\"\n\n\n Schware then petitioned this Court to review his case alleging that he had been denied an opportunity to qualify for the practice of law contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We granted certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 821\n. Cf. In re Summers, \n325 \nU.S. 561, 562\n, 564-569. And see Konigsberg v. State Bar of California, post, p. 252, decided this day.\n\nA State cannot exclude a person from the practice of law or from any other occupation in a manner or for reasons that contravene the Due Process or Equal Protection \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 239]\n\u00a0\n Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n5\n Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114\n. Cf. Slochower v. Board of Education, \n350 \nU.S. 551\n; Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n. And see Ex parte Secombe, 19 How. 9, 13. A State can require high standards of qualification, such as good moral character or proficiency in its law, before it admits an applicant to the bar, but any qualification must have a rational connection with the applicant's fitness or capacity to practice law. Douglas v. Noble, \n261 \nU.S. 165\n; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 319-320. Cf. Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n. Obviously an applicant could not be excluded merely because he was a Republican or a Negro or a member of a particular church. Even in applying permissible standards, officers of a State cannot exclude an applicant when there is no basis for their finding that he fails to meet these standards, or when their action is invidiously discriminatory. Cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n.\n\nHere the State concedes that Schware is fully qualified to take the examination in all respects other than good moral character. Therefore the question is whether the Supreme Court of New Mexico on the record before us could reasonably find that he had not shown good moral character.\n\nThere is nothing in the record which suggests that Schware has engaged in any conduct during the past 15 years which reflects adversely on his character. The New Mexico Supreme Court recognized that he \"presently \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 240]\n\u00a0\n enjoys good repute among his teachers, his fellow students and associates and in his synagogue.\" Schware's professors, his fellow students, his business associates and the rabbi of the synagogue of which he and his family are members, all gave testimony that he is a good man, a man who is imbued with a sense of deep responsibility for his family, who is trustworthy, who respects the rights and beliefs of others. From the record it appears he is a man of religious conviction and is training his children in the beliefs and practices of his faith. A solicitude for others is demonstrated by the fact that he regularly read the Bible to an illiterate soldier while in the Army and law to a blind student while at the University of New Mexico law school. His industry is depicted by the fact that he supported his wife and two children and paid for a costly professional education by operating a business separately while studying law. He demonstrated candor by informing the Board of his personal history and by going to the dean of the law school and disclosing his past. The undisputed evidence in the record shows Schware to be a man of high ideals with a deep sense of social justice. Not a single witness testified that he was not a man of good character.\n\nDespite Schware's showing of good character, the Board and court below thought there were certain facts in the record which raised substantial doubts about his moral fitness to practice law.\n\n(1) Aliases. - From 1934 to 1937 Schware used certain aliases. He testified that these aliases were adopted so he could secure a job in businesses which discriminated against Jews in their employment practices and so that he could more effectively organize non-Jewish employees at plants where he worked. Of course it is wrong to use an alias when it is done to cheat or defraud another but it can hardly be said that Schware's attempt to forestall anti-Semitism in securing employment or organizing \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 241]\n\u00a0\n his fellow workers was wrong. He did give an assumed name to police in 1934 when he was picked up in a mass arrest during a labor dispute. He said he did this so he would not be fired as a striker. This is certainly not enough evidence to support an inference that petitioner has bad moral character more than 20 years later.\n\n(2) Arrests. - In response to the questions on the Board's application form Schware stated that he had been arrested on several occasions:\n\n1. In 1934, while he was participating in a bitter labor dispute in the California shipyards, petitioner was arrested at least two times on \"suspicion of criminal syndicalism.\" After being held for a brief period he was released without formal charges being filed against him. He was never indicted nor convicted for any offense in connection with these arrests.\n\nThe mere fact that a man has been arrested has very little, if any, probative value in showing that he has engaged in any misconduct.\n6\n An arrest shows nothing more than that someone probably suspected the person apprehended of an offense. When formal charges are not filed against the arrested person and he is released without trial, whatever probative force the arrest may have had is normally dissipated. Moreover here, the special facts surrounding the 1934 arrests are relevant in shedding light on their present significance. Apparently great numbers of strikers were picked up by police in a series of arrests during the strike at San Pedro and many of these were charged with \"criminal syndicalism.\"\n7\n The California syndicalism \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 242]\n\u00a0\n statutes in effect in 1934 were very broad and vague.\n8\n There is nothing in the record which indicates why Schware was arrested on \"suspicion\" that he had violated this statute. There is no suggestion that he was using force or violence in an attempt to overthrow the state or national government. Again it should be emphasized that these arrests were made more than 20 years ago and petitioner was never formally charged nor tried for any offense related to them.\n\n2. In 1940 Schware was arrested for violating the Neutrality Act of 1917 which makes it unlawful for a person within the United States to join or to hire or retain another to join the army of any foreign state.\n9\n He was indicted but before the case came to trial the prosecution dropped the charges. He had been charged with recruiting persons to go overseas to aid the Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War. Schware testified that he was unaware of this old law at the time. From the facts in the record it is not clear that he was guilty of its violation.\n10\n But even if it be assumed that the law was violated, it does not seem that such an offense indicated moral turpitude - even in 1940. Many persons in this country actively supported the Spanish Loyalist Government. During the prelude to World War II many idealistic young men volunteered to help causes they believed right. It is commonly known that a number of Americans \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 243]\n\u00a0\n joined air squadrons and helped defend China and Great Britain prior to this country's entry into the war. There is no record that any of these volunteers were prosecuted under the Neutrality Act. Few Americans would have regarded their conduct as evidence of moral turpitude. In determining whether a person's character is good the nature of the offense which he has committed must be taken into account.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nIn summary, these arrests are wholly insufficient to support a finding that Schware had bad moral character at the time he applied to take the bar examination.\n12\n They all occurred many years ago and in no case was he ever tried or convicted for the offense for which he was arrested.\n\n(3) Membership in the Communist Party. - Schware admitted that he was a member of the Communist Party from 1932 to 1940. Apparently the Supreme Court of New Mexico placed heavy emphasis on this past membership in denying his application.\n13\n It stated:\n\n \"We believe one who has knowingly given his loyalties to [the Communist Party] for six to seven \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 244]\n\u00a0\n years during a period of responsible adulthood is a person of questionable character.\" 60 N. M., at 319, 291 P.2d, at 617.\n\n\n The court assumed that in the 1930's when petitioner was a member of the Communist Party, it was dominated by a foreign power and was dedicated to the violent overthrow of the Government and that every member was aware of this. It based this assumption primarily on a view of the nature and purposes of the Communist Party as of 1950 expressed in a concurring opinion in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382, 422\n. However that view did not purport to be a factual finding in that case and obviously it cannot be used as a substitute for evidence in this case to show that petitioner participated in any illegal activity or did anything morally reprehensible as a member of that Party. During the period when Schware was a member, the Communist Party was a lawful political party with candidates on the ballot in most States.\n14\n There is nothing in the record that gives any indication that his association with that Party was anything more than a political faith in a political party. That faith may have been unorthodox. But as counsel for New Mexico said in his brief, \"Mere unorthodoxy [in the field of political and social ideas] does not as a matter of fair and logical inference, negative `good moral character.'\"\n15\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 245]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSchware joined the Communist Party when he was a young man during the midst of this country's greatest depression. Apparently many thousands of other Americans joined him in this step.\n16\n During the depression when millions were unemployed and our economic system was paralyzed many turned to the Communist Party out of desperation or hope. It proposed a radical solution to the grave economic crisis. Later the rise of fascism as a menace to democracy spurred others who feared this form of tyranny to align with the Communist Party.\n17\n After 1935, that Party advocated a \"Popular Front\" of \"all democratic parties against fascism.\" Its platform and slogans stressed full employment, racial equality and various other political and economic changes.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nDuring the depression Schware was led to believe that drastic changes needed to be made in the existing economic system. There is nothing in the record, however, which indicates that he ever engaged in any actions to \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 246]\n\u00a0\n overthrow the Government of the United States or of any State by force or violence, or that he even advocated such actions. Assuming that some members of the Communist Party during the period from 1932 to 1940 had illegal aims and engaged in illegal activities, it cannot automatically be inferred that all members shared their evil purposes or participated in their illegal conduct. As this Court declared in Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183, 191\n: \"Indiscriminate classification of innocent with knowing activity must fall as an assertion of arbitrary power.\" Cf. Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, \n341 \nU.S. 123, 136\n.\n19\n And finally, there is no suggestion that Schware was affiliated with the Communist Party after 1940 - more than 15 years ago. We conclude that his past membership in the Communist Party does not justify an inference that he presently has bad moral character.\n\nThe State contends that even though the use of aliases, the arrests, and the membership in the Communist Party would not justify exclusion of petitioner from the New Mexico bar if each stood alone, when all three are combined his exclusion was not unwarranted. We cannot accept this contention. In the light of petitioner's forceful showing of good moral character, the evidence upon which the State relies - the arrests for offenses for which petitioner was neither tried nor convicted, the use of an assumed name many years ago, and membership in the Communist Party during the 1930's - cannot be said to raise substantial doubts about his present good moral character. There is no evidence in the record which \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 247]\n\u00a0\n rationally justifies a finding that Schware was morally unfit to practice law.\n20\n\u00a0\n\nOn the record before us we hold that the State of New Mexico deprived petitioner of due process in denying him the opportunity to qualify for the practice of law. The judgment below is reversed and the case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Generally, see N. M. Stat. Ann., 1953, 18-1-8 and the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar appended thereto.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Apparently the Board had received confidential information that Schware had once been a member of the Communist Party. The Board's application form did not request disclosure of such information and so Schware did not mention it in his application. At the hearing he testified at length about his membership. The Board refused to let petitioner see the confidential information against him, although it appears that its initial denial of his application was partially based on this information. While this secret evidence was not made a part of the record of the hearing, counsel for petitioner contends that the Board was influenced by it in adhering to its view that petitioner was not qualified. In the New Mexico Supreme Court the members of the majority did not look at the confidential information. And while that court passed on petitioner's qualifications in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, the majority placed considerable reliance on the Board's recommendations. Therefore, petitioner contends, the Board's use of confidential information deprived him of procedural due process. Cf. Goldsmith v. United States Bd. of Tax Appeals, \n270 \nU.S. 117\n; Bratton v. Chandler, \n260 \nU.S. 110\n; Minkoff v. Payne, 93 U.S. App. D.C. 123, 210 F.2d 689, 691; In re Carter, 89 U.S. App. D.C. 310, 192 F.2d 15, cert. denied, \n342 \nU.S. 862\n. We find it unnecessary to consider this contention.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The dean was on sabbatical leave and not available.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] At times during 1932 more than 12,060,000 of the nation's 51,000,000 working persons were unemployed. Statistical Abstract of the United States (1956) 197.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] We need not enter into a discussion whether the practice of law is a \"right\" or \"privilege.\" Regardless of how the State's grant of permission to engage in this occupation is characterized, it is sufficient to say that a person cannot be prevented from practicing except for valid reasons. Certainly the practice of law is not a matter of the State's grace. Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 379.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Arrest, by itself, is not considered competent evidence at either a criminal or civil trial to prove that a person did certain prohibited acts. Cf. Wigmore, Evidence, 980a.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Petitioner testified that during a two-month period about 2,000 persons were arrested in connection with the strike. Generally, for criticism of these arrests and the conduct of the police during these and related strikes see S. Rep. No. 1150, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 35, 131, 133-141.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] \"The term `criminal syndicalism' as used in this act is hereby defined as any doctrine or precept advocating, teaching or aiding and abetting the commission of crime, sabotage (which word is hereby defined as meaning wilful and malicious physical damage or injury to physical property), or unlawful acts of force and violence or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing a change in industrial ownership or control, or effecting any political change.\" Cal. Stat. 1919, c. 188, 1. See also De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353\n, where application of a similar statute was held unconstitutional.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 40 Stat. 39, now 18 U.S.C. 959 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See Kiker, J. (dissenting), 60 N. M. 304, 321, 291 P.2d 607, 618.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] For example, New Mexico makes conviction of a felony or a misdemeanor grounds for disbarment only if it involves moral turpitude. N. M. Stat. Ann., 1953, 18-1-17 (1). Compare In re Burch, 73 Ohio App. 97, 54 N. E. 2d 803, where, in a disbarment proceeding, conviction for violation of a federal statute for failing to register as an agent of the German Government in 1941 was held not to evidence moral turpitude.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] In 1941 Schware was arrested by police in Texas while driving a friend's car to the west coast. Apparently the police suspected the car was stolen. After a brief delay they became convinced that the car was rightfully in petitioner's possession and he was allowed to go on his way. This detention offers no proof of bad moral character and the State does not rely on it here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Petitioner argues that a State constitutionally cannot consider his membership in a lawful political party in determining whether he is qualified for admission to the bar. He contends that a denial based on such membership abridges the right of free political association \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 244]\n\u00a0\n guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Because of our disposition of this case, we find it unnecessary to pass on this contention.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] For example in 1936 its presidential nominee was on the ballot in 35 States, including New Mexico.

The bar has not enjoyed prerogatives; it has been entrusted with anxious responsibilities. One does not have to inhale the self-adulatory bombast of after-dinner speeches to affirm that all the interests of man that are comprised under the constitutional guarantees given to \"life, liberty and property\" are in the professional keeping of lawyers. It is a fair characterization of the lawyer's responsibility in our society that he stands \"as a shield,\" to quote Devlin, J., in defense of right and to ward off wrong. From a profession charged with such responsibilities there must be exacted those qualities of truth-speaking, of a high sense of honor, of granite discretion, of the strictest observance of fiduciary responsibility, that have, throughout the centuries, been compendiously described as \"moral character.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 248]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrom the thirteenth century to this day, in England the profession itself has determined who should enter it. In the United States the courts exercise ultimate control. But while we have nothing comparable to the Inns of Court, with us too the profession itself, through appropriate committees, has long had a vital interest, as a sifting agency, in determining the fitness, and above all the moral fitness, of those who are certified to be entrusted with the fate of clients. With us too the requisite \"moral character\" has been the historic unquestioned prerequisite of fitness. Admission to practice in a State and before its courts necessarily belongs to that State. Of course, legislation laying down general conditions of an arbitrary or discriminatory character may, like other legislation, fall afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277. A very different question is presented when this Court is asked to review the exercise of judgment in refusing admission to the bar in an individual case, such as we have here.\n\nIt is beyond this Court's function to act as overseer of a particular result of the procedure established by a particular State for admission to its bar. No doubt satisfaction of the requirement of moral character involves an exercise of delicate judgment on the part of those who reach a conclusion, having heard and seen the applicant for admission, a judgment of which it may be said as it was of \"many honest and sensible judgments\" in a different context that it expresses \"an intuition of experience which outruns analysis and sums up many unnamed and tangled impressions; impressions which may lie beneath consciousness without losing their worth.\" Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Babcock, \n204 \nU.S. 585, 598\n. Especially in this realm it is not our business to substitute our judgment for the State's judgment - for it is the State in all the panoply of its powers that is under review when the action of its Supreme Court is under review. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 249]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor is the division of power between this Court and that of the States in such matters altered by the fact that the judgment here challenged involves the application of a conception like that of \"moral character,\" which has shadowy rather than precise bounds. It cannot be that that conception - moral character - has now been found to be so indefinite, because necessarily implicating what are called subjective factors, that the States may no longer exact it from those who are to carry on \"the public profession of the law.\" (See Elihu Root, in 2 A. B. A. J. 736.) To a wide and deep extent, the law depends upon the disciplined standards of the profession and belief in the integrity of the courts. We cannot fail to accord such confidence to the state process, and we must attribute to its courts the exercise of a fair and not a biased judgment in passing upon the applications of those seeking entry into the profession.\n\nBut judicial action, even in an individual case, may have been based on avowed considerations that are inadmissible in that they violate the requirements of due process. Refusal to allow a man to qualify himself for the profession on a wholly arbitrary standard or on a consideration that offends the dictates of reason offends the Due Process Clause. Such is the case here.\n\nLiving under hard circumstances, the petitioner, while still in his teens, encountered the confusions and dislocations of the great depression. By one of those chance occurrences that not infrequently determine the action of youth, petitioner joined the Young Communist League toward the end of his high-school days. That association led to membership in the Communist Party, which he retained until the Hitler-Stalin Pact began a disaffection that was completed by his break with the Party in 1940. After 1940, the record of his life, including three years of honorable service in the army, establishes that these early associations, and the outlook they reflected, had \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 250]\n\u00a0\n been entirely left behind.\n*\n After his war service, three years as a small businessman, and one year at Western Michigan College, petitioner resolved on becoming a lawyer. And so in 1950, at the age of 36, he enrolled in the University of New Mexico Law School and made full disclosure of his early Communist career to its Dean. These are the facts that, taken together with the use of aliases and arrests without conviction or even prosecution, both in his early years, led the Supreme Court of New Mexico, in an original proceeding before it after adverse action by the Board of Bar Examiners, to deny petitioner's application to take the bar examination.\n\nFor me, the controlling element in determining whether such denial offended the Due Process Clause is the significance that the New Mexico Supreme Court accorded the early Communist affiliations. In its original opinion and in its opinion on rehearing, the court thus reiterated its legal position:\n\n  \"We believe one who has knowingly given his  loyalties to such a program and belief for six to seven  years during a period of responsible adulthood is a  person of questionable character.\" 60 N. M. 304,  319, 339, 291 P.2d 607, 617, 630.\n\n\n Since the New Mexico Supreme Court unequivocally held this to be a factor without which, on a fair reading of its opinion, it would not have denied the application, the conclusion that it drew from all the factors in necessary combination must fall if it drew an unwarranted legal conclusion from petitioner's early Communist affiliation. Not unnaturally the New Mexico Supreme Court evidently \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 251]\n\u00a0\n assumed that use of aliases in the pre-1940 period, several unprosecuted arrests, and what it deemed \"his present attitude toward those matters,\" 60 N. M., at 339, 291 P.2d, at 630 (as drawn from the printed record and not on the basis of having given the petitioner a hearing before the court) precluded denial of his application on these factors alone.\n\nThis brings me to the inference that the court drew from petitioner's early, pre-1940 affiliations. To hold, as the court did, that Communist affiliation for six to seven years up to 1940, fifteen years prior to the court's assessment of it, in and of itself made the petitioner \"a person of questionable character\" is so dogmatic an inference as to be wholly unwarranted. History overwhelmingly establishes that many youths like the petitioner were drawn by the mirage of communism during the depression era, only to have their eyes later opened to reality. Such experiences no doubt may disclose a woolly mind or naive notions regarding the problems of society. But facts of history that we would be arbitrary in rejecting bar the presumption, let alone an irrebuttable presumption, that response to foolish, baseless hopes regarding the betterment of society made those who had entertained them but who later undoubtedly came to their senses and their sense of responsibility \"questionable characters.\" Since the Supreme Court of New Mexico as a matter of law took a contrary view of such a situation in denying petitioner's application, it denied him due process of law.\n\nI therefore concur in the judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The only bit of evidence that may be adduced to the contrary is a single phrase in a letter to his wife in 1944. To give it an unfavorable and disqualifying significance in the entire context of the letter is to draw so strained a meaning as to be inadmissibly unreasonable. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 232, 252]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSENKO v. LACROSSE DREDGING CORP.(1957)\nNo. 62\nArgued: December 12, 1956Decided: February 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was employed by respondent in dredging operations. The dredge was anchored to the shore at all times during petitioner's employment and was seldom in transit. Petitioner was injured in the course of his employment while ashore, and brought an action in a state court to recover damages under the Jones Act. Petitioner's evidence tended to show that he was employed almost solely on the dredge, that his duty was primarily to maintain the dredge during its anchorage and for its future trips, and that he would have a significant navigational function when the dredge was in transit. The jury returned a verdict for petitioner and judgment was entered in his favor. Held: There was sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury's finding that petitioner was a \"member of a crew\" entitled to maintain the action under the Jones Act. Pp. 370-374.\n\n (a) The fact that the dredge in this case was connected to the shore is not controlling; nor is the fact that the injury occurred on land. P. 373.\n\n\n (b) In an action under the Jones Act, the finding of a jury that the claimant was a \"member of a crew\" is final if it has a reasonable basis, whether or not the appellate court agrees with the jury's estimate. Pp. 373-374.\n\n\n 7 Ill. App. 2d 307, 129 N. E. 2d 454, reversed and remanded.\n\nGeorge J. Moran argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Stanley M. Rosenblum.\n\nStuart B. Bradley argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Henry Driemeyer and Robert Broderick.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner was employed by respondent to assist with dredging operations being conducted by respondent in a slough dug to by-pass a rocky section of the Mississippi \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 371]\n\u00a0\n River. His work was that of a handyman; it included the carrying and storing of supplies, and the general maintenance of a dredge. He was injured by the explosion of a coal stove while placing signal lanterns from the dredge in a shed on the neighboring bank. He filed this suit under the Jones Act in the City Court of Granite City, Illinois, to recover damages for his injuries. The Act provides a cause of action for \"any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment.\" 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. 688. This Court, however, has held that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act of March 4, 1927, 44 Stat. 1424, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., restricts the benefits of the Jones Act to \"members of a crew of a vessel.\" Swanson v. Marra Bros., Inc., \n328 \nU.S. 1\n. To recover, therefore, petitioner had to be a member of a crew, as that term is used in the Longshoremen's Act, at the time of his injury.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict for petitioner and judgment was entered in his favor. On appeal, the Fourth District Appellate Court of the State of Illinois held that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding that petitioner was a member of a crew.\n1\n Accordingly, it reversed the trial court and entered judgment for respondent. Senko v. LaCrosse Dredging Corp., 7 Ill. App. 2d 307, 129 N. E. 2d 454. The Illinois Supreme Court denied a petition for an appeal. We granted certiorari. \n351 \nU.S. 949\n.\n\nIn South Chicago Co. v. Bassett, \n309 \nU.S. 251\n, we said that whether or not an employee is \"`a member of a crew' turns on questions of fact\" and that, if a finding on this question has evidence to support it, the finding is conclusive. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 372]\n\u00a0\n Id., at 257-258.\n2\n The sole question presented here, therefore, is whether there is an evidentiary basis for the jury's finding that petitioner was a member of a crew at the time of his injury. This finding was made under specific instructions not objected to here.\n\nThe appellate court characterized petitioner as\n\n \"an employee whose principal duty is to load supplies  on a vessel at anchor, and to perform incidental  tasks of a common labor character . . . .\" 7 Ill.  App. 2d, at 313, 129 N. E. 2d, at 457.\n\n\n They also noted that petitioner lived ashore and was not aboard except when the vessel was anchored. The court concluded that petitioner was not \"naturally and primarily on board to aid in navigation\" and could not \"maintain an action under the Jones Act.\" 7 Ill. App. 2d, at 313-314, 129 N. E. 2d, at 457.\n\nIt is true that the dredge was anchored to the shore at the time of petitioner's injury and during all the time petitioner worked for respondent. It is also true that this dredge, like most dredges, was not frequently in transit. We believe, however, that there is sufficient evidence in the record for the jury to decide that petitioner was permanently attached to and employed by the dredge as a member of its crew.\n\nPetitioner's witnesses testified that he was known as a \"deckhand\" among rivermen. They said that he was hired to clean and take care of the deck, splice rope, stow supplies, and, in general, to keep the dredge \"in shape.\" This testimony indicated that substantially all of petitioner's duties were performed on or for the dredge. A normal inference is that petitioner was responsible for \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 373]\n\u00a0\n its seaworthiness. If the dredge leaked, for example, the jury could suppose that his job would be to repair the leak. Furthermore, a witness testified that a usual duty of one holding petitioner's job was to take soundings and clean navigation lights when the dredge was in transit. 7 Ill. App. 2d, at 310, 129 N. E. 2d, at 455-456. Here again, the jury could reasonably have believed that petitioner would have these responsibilities in the event that this dredge were moved. Whether petitioner would be a member of the dredge's crew while taking soundings during a trip is certainly a jury question. If he were a member during travel, he would not necessarily lack that status during anchorage. Even a transoceanic liner may be confined to berth for lengthy periods, and while there the ship is kept in repair by its \"crew\". There can be no doubt that a member of its crew would be covered by the Jones Act during this period, even though the ship was never in transit during his employment. In short, the duties of a man during a vessel's travel are relevant in determining whether he is a \"member of a crew\" while the vessel is anchored. Thus, the fact that this dredge was connected to the shore cannot be controlling.\n\nThe fact that petitioner's injury occurred on land is not material. Admiralty jurisdiction and the coverage of the Jones Act depends only on a finding that the injured was \"an employee of the vessel, engaged in the course of his employment\" at the time of his injury. Swanson v. Marra Bros., Inc., \n328 \nU.S. 1, 4\n, citing O'Donnell v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., \n318 \nU.S. 36\n.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nAs we have said before, this Court does not normally sit to re-examine a finding of the type that was made below. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 374]\n\u00a0\n We believe, however, that our decision in South Chicago Co. v. Bassett, supra, has not been fully understood. Our holding there that the determination of whether an injured person was a \"member of a crew\" is to be left to the finder of fact meant that juries have the same discretion they have in finding negligence or any other fact. The essence of this discretion is that a jury's decision is final if it has a reasonable basis, whether or not the appellate court agrees with the jury's estimate.\n\nBecause there was testimony introduced by petitioner tending to show that he was employed almost solely on the dredge, that his duty was primarily to maintain the dredge during its anchorage and for its future trips, and that he would have a significant navigational function when the dredge was put in transit, we hold there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that petitioner was a member of the dredge's crew. Cf. Gianfala v. Texas Co., \n350 \nU.S. 879\n, reversing 222 F.2d 382. Accordingly, we reverse the decision below.\n\nRespondent, on its appeal from the trial court's judgment, raised two questions which the appellate court did not reach because of its disposition of the case.\n4\n So that these issues may be reviewed, we remand the case to that court.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Although two other grounds were advanced on appeal, only this one was considered. See n. 4, infra. No question has been raised at any time as to whether the dredge involved here had the status of a \"vessel\" at the time of petitioner's injury.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The finder of fact in the Bassett case was a commissioner, but that holding applies with equal force to this case in which the finder was a jury.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"The admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States shall extend to and include all cases of damage or injury, to person or property, caused by a vessel on navigable water, notwithstanding that such damage or injury be done or consummated on land.\" 62 Stat. 496, 46 U.S.C. 740.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"2, the dredge was not operating in navigable waters; and 3, there was no evidence of negligence on its part and no basis to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\" 7 Ill. App. 2d, at 309, 129 N. E. 2d, at 455.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.\n\nIn my opinion the court below properly dismissed the complaint because the evidence shows affirmatively that \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 375]\n\u00a0\n petitioner was not a member of a \"crew of a vessel,\"\n1\n as that term has heretofore been used by the courts, or indeed according to any commonly understood meaning of the expression. Since the passage of the Longshoremen's Act in 1927,\n2\n such membership has been a prerequisite to the right to sue under the Jones Act.\n3\n Swanson v. Marra Bros., \n328 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\nAccording to past decisions, to be a \"member of a crew\" an individual must have some connection, more or less permanent, with a ship and a ship's company.\n4\n More particularly, this Court has said that he must be \"naturally and primarily on board to aid in . . . navigation,\" as distinguished from those \"serving on vessels, to be sure, but [whose] service was that of laborers, of the sort performed by longshoremen and harbor workers.\" Congress intended to remove from the coverage of the Jones Act \"all those various sorts of longshoremen and harbor workers who were performing labor on a vessel.\" South Chicago Coal & Dock Co. v. Bassett, \n309 \nU.S. 251, 260\n, 257.\n\nPetitioner's relationship to this dredge met none of these requirements. He was simply an ordinary laborer, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 376]\n\u00a0\n a member of the Common Laborers' Union. Temporarily unemployed, he applied to his union, which sent him to respondent as a laborer. Respondent was a contractor on the canal-digging project, and employed a construction gang on shore under the supervision of a foreman. This foreman assigned Senko to take the job of \"deckhand\" or \"laborer\" on respondent's dredge, the James Wilkinson, a craft which, though afloat, served as a stationary earth-removing machine. His duties there were miscellaneous, consisting of serving as assistant and handy-man to the team of men operating the earthremoving pumps. He carried supplies from shore to dredge and back, cleaned up the dredge, filled the water cooler, and did errands on shore. He worked an eight-hour shift, was paid by the hour, and received premium pay for overtime. He lived at home, drove to work every day, and brought his own meals. He did not belong to the National Maritime Union or any other seamen's organization. He was subject to the discipline and supervision not of officers of a vessel but of the labor foreman in charge of the construction project, who worked on shore. At any time Senko could have been shifted to a job on shore by the foreman and replaced with one of the shore laborers; in other words, his connection was not with the vessel but with the construction gang. He had no duties connected with navigation; in fact he had never been on the dredge when it was pushed from one location to another, and never even saw it moved.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to indicate that petitioner was responsible for the seaworthiness of the dredge, or that he ever performed or was qualified to perform any duties of that type. True, he cleaned lights, but these were not \"navigation\" lights, as the dredge did not carry the latter except when under tow. In effect he cleaned lanterns and placed them when the construction work continued at night. Again, he took \"soundings,\" but in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 377]\n\u00a0\n spite of the maritime flavor of the phrase, the facts permit no salty inference, since the soundings were taken not in aid of navigation (the dredge being completely stationary at such times), but only to measure the amount of silt pumped from the canal. All this means is that Senko occasionally measured the work-progress on an earth-removal project, a task about as nautical as measuring the depth of a natural swimming pool under construction in marshy ground.\n\nI do not think that these facts permit a finding that petitioner was a \"member of a crew,\" more or less permanently connected with a ship's company and on board \"naturally and primarily\" in aid of navigation. His nexus was not with a ship's company but with a construction crew on shore. He signed no papers to join the vessel and his employment was governed by no \"articles\"; he was merely assigned by the Laborers' Union \"pusher\" to this particular task on an earth-removing project. His boss was not a ship's officer but a construction superintendent whose office was on land. In fact the record is bare of any of the things which common sense demands of a \"ship's company.\" There was no captain, no master, no mate, no ship's papers or ship's discipline, no log, no galley, no watches to stand. And to say that Senko's job was naturally and primarily in aid of navigation can be done, it seems to me, only at the cost of removing from those words all semblance of content. Not only did Senko have nothing to do with navigation, but he did not \"aid\" navigation in the sense of helping to maintain the vessel or its crew in a condition to navigate.\n5\n He was \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 378]\n\u00a0\n simply a handy-man and assistant for a crew of men operating an earth-removing machine which happened to be afloat and which, occasionally and always in Senko's absence, was pushed from place to place.\n\nThe fact that it was a jury that found Senko to be \"a member of a crew\" does not relieve us of the responsibility for seeing to it that what is in effect a jurisdictional requirement of the Jones Act is obeyed. This Court has more than once reviewed similar determinations of other fact-finding bodies, and set them aside when satisfied that they did not meet the requirements of the Jones Act or Longshoremen's Act. Cantey v. McLain Line, Inc., \n312 \nU.S. 667\n; Norton v. Warner Co., \n321 \nU.S. 565\n; Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., \n342 \nU.S. 187\n. The reason is, of course, as the Court said in the Norton case, supra, that \"where Congress has provided that those basic rights [conferred by the Jones Act] shall not be withheld from a class or classes of maritime employees it is our duty on judicial review to respect the command and not permit the exemption [arising from the Longshoremen's Act] to be narrowed whether by administrative construction or otherwise.\" \n321 \nU.S., at 571\n.\n6\n I cannot see why this same sound reasoning should not apply in reverse, that is, where Congress has provided that a right shall be withheld from a certain class, and where that class has been narrowed by the \"construction\" of some fact-finding body. Nor, I submit, should it make any difference that such a body is a jury.\n7\n A jury's verdict \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 379]\n\u00a0\n casts no such spell as should lead the Court to permit it to rob this restriction of the Jones Act of meaningful significance. This, in my opinion, is what today's decision permits.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nI would affirm the decision of the court below. This would not leave petitioner without a remedy. He has already applied for and secured workmen's compensation under the Illinois Workmen's Compensation Act. This is the relief which Congress intended him to have, and I would not add to it another remedy denied by Congress.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is assumed that this dredge may properly be regarded as a \"vessel.\" And, with the Court, I do not reach the question of whether the swampy land in which the dredge was operating could be deemed \"navigable water,\" an additional factor conditioning the applicability of the Jones Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 46 U.S.C. 688.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Warner v. Goltra, \n293 \nU.S. 155\n; South Chicago Coal & Dock Co. v. Bassett, \n309 \nU.S. 251\n; Norton v. Warner Co., \n321 \nU.S. 565\n; Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., \n342 \nU.S. 187\n; The Bound Brook, 146 F. 160, 164; The Buena Ventura, 243 F. 797; Seneca Washed Gravel Corp. v. McManigal, 65 F.2d 779; De Wald v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 71 F.2d 810; Diomede v. Lowe, 87 F.2d 296; Moore Dry Dock Co. v. Pillsbury, 100 F.2d 245; Wilkes v. Mississippi River Sand & Gravel Co., 202 F.2d 383, 388.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] I do not, of course, contend that men such as ship's cooks cannot be members of a crew merely because their actual jobs have nothing to do with making the vessel move. The vital distinction is that such men do contribute to the functioning of the vessel as a vessel - as a means of transport on water. Not so Senko, whose duties had absolutely nothing to do with the dredge in its aspects as a vessel.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is worth noting that in Norton, where the Court reversed a determination by a Commissioner that a bargeman in general charge of a barge was not a member of a crew, all of the factors on which the Court relied are conspicuously absent here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Certainly South Chicago Coal & Dock Co. v. Bassett, supra, upon which the Court relies, does not suggest that a jury's verdict on this issue is to be accorded some special sanctity. That case simply held that a District Court could not grant a trial de novo on an issue \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 379]\n\u00a0\n within the primary jurisdiction of the Administrator, under the Longshoremen's Act. There is no comparable fact-finding procedure under the Jones Act. Moreover, despite the fact that the Longshoremen's Act gave the Administrator \"full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of\" claims under the Act, this Court did in fact examine the Administrator's determination that the plaintiff there was not a member of a crew, and sustained it only after concluding that it was supported by the evidence. Further, the Court's citation of Bassett in Cantey v. McLain Line, Inc., supra, would seem in context to imply that the Court regarded the result in Bassett as reflecting its own independent determination as to the status of the petitioner there, rather than as a decision passing merely on the scope of judicial review to be accorded to the determination of the Administrator. And, if that be so, Bassett should surely control the result here, since if the Bassett petitioner was as a matter of law not a \"member of a crew,\" a fortiori, Senko was not.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Gianfala v. Texas Co., \n350 \nU.S. 879\n, should not be regarded as an obstacle to reaching what, in my view, is plainly the right result here. The petitioner in Gianfala at least played a part in the operation of moving the barge, and thus arguably was performing a function \"in aid of\" navigation. Moreover, the per curiam order in Gianfala, entered solely on the basis of the petition for certiorari, without the benefit of an opposing brief or oral argument, can scarcely be regarded as a precedent of much significance. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 370, 380]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSERVICE v. DULLES(1957)\nNo. 407\nArgued: Decided: June 17, 1957\n\n\n\n\n This suit was brought by petitioner, a Foreign Service Officer, to test the validity of his discharge by the Secretary of State under these circumstances: The State Department's Loyalty Security Board had repeatedly cleared petitioner of charges of being disloyal and a security risk; and its findings had been approved by the Deputy Under Secretary, whose approval of findings favorable to an employee were final under the applicable Regulations. No finding unfavorable to petitioner ever had been made by the Department's Loyalty Security Board or the Deputy Under Secretary, and no recommendation unfavorable to petitioner ever had been made by the Deputy Under Secretary to the Secretary. Nevertheless, the Loyalty Review Board of the Civil Service Commission, on its own motion, conducted its own hearing, found that there was reasonable doubt as to petitioner's loyalty, and advised the Secretary that petitioner \"should be forthwith removed from the rolls of the Department of State.\" Acting solely on the basis of the finding of that Board, and without making any independent determination of his own on the record in the case, the Secretary discharged petitioner on the same day. He based this action on Executive Orders No. 9835 and No. 10241 and 103 of Public Law 188, 82d Congress, commonly known as the McCarran Rider, which authorized the Secretary, \"in his absolute discretion,\" to \"terminate the employment of any officer . . . of the Foreign Service . . . whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.\" Held: Petitioner's discharge was invalid, because it violated Regulations of the Department of State which were binding on the Secretary; and the judgment is reversed.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Doub and Paul A. Sweeney.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn December 14, 1951, petitioner, John S. Service, was discharged by the then Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, from his employment as a Foreign Service Officer in the Foreign Service of the United States. This case brings before us the validity of that discharge.\n\nAt the time of his discharge in 1951, Service had been a Foreign Service Officer for some sixteen years, during ten of which, 1935-1945, he had served in various capacities in China. In April 1945, shortly after his return to this country, Service became involved in the so-called Amerasia investigation through having furnished to one Jaffe, the editor of the Amerasia magazine, copies of certain of his Foreign Service reports. Two months later, Service, Jaffe and others were arrested and charged with violating the Espionage Act,\n1\n but the grand jury, in August 1945, refused to indict Service. He was thereupon restored to active duty in the Foreign Service, from which he had been on leave of absence since his arrest, and returned to duty in the Far East.\n\nFrom then on Service's loyalty and standing as a security risk were under recurrent investigation and review by a number of governmental agencies under the provisions of Executive Order No. 9835,\n2\n establishing the President's Loyalty Program, and otherwise. He was accorded successive \"clearances\" by the State Department \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 366]\n\u00a0\n in each of the years 1945, 1946 and 1947,\n3\n and a fourth clearance in 1949 by that Department's Loyalty Security Board, which, however, was directed by the Loyalty Review Board of the Civil Service Commission, when the case was examined by it on \"post-audit,\"\n4\n to prefer charges against Service and conduct a hearing thereon. This was done, and on October 6, 1950, after extensive hearings, the Department Board concluded that \"reasonable grounds do not exist for belief that . . . Service is disloyal to the Government of the United States . . .,\" and that \". . . he does not constitute a security risk to the Department of State.\" These findings were approved by the Deputy Under Secretary of State, acting pursuant to authority delegated to him by the Secretary.\n5\n Again, however, the Loyalty Review Board, on post-audit, remanded the case to the Department Board for further consideration.\n6\n Such consideration was had, this time under the more stringent loyalty standard established by Executive Order No. 10241,\n7\n amending the earlier Executive Order No. 9835, and again the Department Board, on July 31, 1951, decided favorably to Service. This determination was likewise approved by the Deputy Under Secretary. However, on a further post-audit, the Loyalty Review Board decided to conduct a new hearing itself, which resulted this time in the Board's finding that there was a reasonable doubt as to Service's loyalty, and \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 367]\n\u00a0\n in its advising the Secretary of State, on December 13, 1951, that in the Board's opinion Service \"should be forthwith removed from the rolls of the Department of State\" and that \"the Secretary should approve and adopt the proceedings\" had before the Board.\n8\n On the same \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 368]\n\u00a0\n day the Department notified Service of his discharge, effective at the close of business on the following day.\n\nThe authority and basis upon which the Secretary acted in discharging petitioner are set forth in an affidavit later filed by Mr. Acheson in the present litigation, in which he states:\n\n \"2. On December 13, 1951, I received a letter from the Chairman of the Loyalty Review Board of the Civil Service Commission submitting to me that Board's opinion, dated December 12, 1951, in the case of John S. Service, a Foreign Service officer of the Department of State and the plaintiff in this action.\n\n\n \"3. On that same day I considered what action should be taken in the light of the opinion of the Loyalty Review Board, recognizing that whatever action taken would be of utmost importance to the administration of the Government Employees Loyalty Program. I understood that the responsibility was vested in me to make the necessary determination under both Executive Order No. 9835, as \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 369]\n\u00a0\n amended, and under Section 103 of Public Law 188, 82d Congress, as to what action to take.\n\n\n \"4. Acting in the exercise of the authority vested in me as Secretary of State by Executive Order 9835, as amended by Executive Order 10241, and also by Section 103 of Public Law 188, 82d Congress (65 Stat. 575, 581), I made a determination to terminate the services of Mr. Service as a Foreign Service Officer in the Foreign Service of the United States.\n\n\n \"5. I made that determination solely as the result of the finding of the Loyalty Review Board and as a result of my review of the opinion of that Board. In making this determination, I did not read the testimony taken in the proceedings in Mr. Service's case before the Loyalty Review Board of the Civil Service Commission. I did not make any independent determination of my own as to whether on the evidence submitted before those boards there was reasonable doubt as to Mr. Service's loyalty. I made no independent judgment on the record in this case. There was nothing in the opinion of the Loyalty Review Board which would make it incompatible with the exercise of my responsibilities as Secretary of State to act on it. I deemed it appropriate and advisable to act on the basis of the finding and opinion of the Loyalty Review Board. In determining to terminate the employment of Mr. Service, I did not consider that I was legally bound or required by the opinion of the Loyalty Review Board to take such action. On the contrary, I considered that the opinion of the Loyalty Review Board was merely an advisory recommendation to me and that I was legally free to exercise my own judgment as to whether Mr. Service's employment should be terminated and I did so exercise that judgment.\" \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 370]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Section 103 of Public Law 188, 82d Congress,\n9\n upon which the Secretary thus relied, was the so-called McCarran Rider, first enacted as a rider to the Appropriation Act for 1947, which provided:\n\n \"Notwithstanding the provisions of . . . any other law, the Secretary of State may, in his absolute discretion, . . . terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the Department of State or of the Foreign Service of the United States whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States . . . .\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\n\n Similar provisions were re-enacted in each subsequent appropriation act until 1953.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nAfter an attempt to secure further administrative review of his discharge proved unsuccessful, petitioner brought this action, in which he sought a declaratory judgment that his discharge was invalid; an order directing the respondents to expunge from their records all written statements reflecting that his employment had been terminated because there was a reasonable doubt as to his loyalty; and an order directing the Secretary to reinstate him to his employment and former grade in the Foreign Service, with full restoration of property rights and payment of accumulated salary.\n\nWhile cross-motions for summary judgment were pending before the District Court, this Court rendered its decision in Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331\n, holding that under Executive Order No. 9835, the Loyalty Review Board had no authority to review, on post-audit, determinations favorable to employees made by department or agency \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 371]\n\u00a0\n authorities, or to adjudicate individual cases on its own motion. On the authority of that decision, the District Court declared the finding and opinion of the Loyalty Review Board respecting Service to be a nullity, and directed the Civil Service Commission to expunge from its records the Board's finding that there was reasonable doubt as to his loyalty. But since petitioner's removal rested not only upon Executive Order No. 9835, as amended, but also upon the McCarran Rider, the District Court sustained petitioner's discharge as a valid exercise of the \"absolute discretion\" conferred upon the Secretary by the latter provision, and granted summary judgment in favor of respondents in all other respects.\n12\n The Court of Appeals affirmed, 98 U.S. App. D.C. 268, 235 F.2d 215, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 372]\n\u00a0\n and this Court granted certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 905\n, because of the importance of the questions involved to federal administrators and employees alike.\n\nPetitioner here attacks the validity of the termination of his employment on two separate grounds: First, he contends that the Secretary's exercise of discretion was invalid since the findings and opinion of the Loyalty Review Board, upon which alone the Secretary acted, were void, because they were rendered without jurisdiction\n13\n and were based upon procedures assertedly contrary to due process of law. Even conceding that the Secretary's powers under the McCarran Rider were such that he was not required to state the grounds for his decision, petitioner urges, his decision cannot stand because he did in fact rely upon grounds that are invalid. See Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 80\n; Perkins v. Elg, \n307 \nU.S. 325\n. Second, petitioner contends that the Secretary's action is subject to attack under the principles established by this Court's decision in Accardi v. Shaughnessy, \n347 \nU.S. 260\n, namely, that regulations validly prescribed by a government administrator are binding upon him as well as the citizen, and that this principle holds even when the administrative action under review is discretionary in nature. Regulations relating to \"loyalty and security of employees\" which had been promulgated by the Secretary, petitioner asserts, were intended to govern discharges effected under the McCarran Rider as well as those effected under Executive Order No. 9835, as amended, and because those regulations were violated by the Secretary in this case, so petitioner claims, his dismissal by the Secretary cannot stand. Since, for reasons discussed hereafter, we have concluded that petitioner's second contention must be sustained, we do not reach the first. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 373]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe questions to which we address ourselves therefore are as follows: (1) Were the departmental Regulations here involved applicable to discharges effected under the McCarran Rider? and (2) Were those Regulations violated in this instance? We do not understand the respondents to dispute that the principle of Accardi v. Shaughnessy, supra, is controlling, if we find that the Regulations were indeed applicable and were violated. We might also add that we are not here concerned in any wise with the merits of the Secretary's action in terminating the petitioner's employment.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWe think it is not open to serious question that the departmental Regulations upon which petitioner relies were applicable to McCarran Rider discharges as well as to those effected pursuant to the Loyalty-Security program. The terms of the Regulations, the fact that the Department itself proceeded in this very case under those Regulations down to the point of petitioner's discharge, representations made by the State Department to Congress relating to its practices under the McCarran Rider, and the announced wish of the President to the effect that McCarran Rider authority should be exercised subject to procedural safeguards designed to protect \"the personal liberties of employees,\" all combine to lead to that conclusion. We also think it clear that these Regulations were valid, so far as their validity is put in issue by the respondents in this case.\n\nA. \nThe Regulations.\n\nWhen the Department's proceedings against the petitioner, which resulted in the \"clearances\" of October 6, 1950, and July 31, 1951, were begun, the Regulations in effect were those of March 11, 1949, entitled \"Regulations and Procedures relating to Loyalty and Security of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 374]\n\u00a0\n Employees, U.S. Department of State.\"\n14\n Section 391 stated the \"Authority and General Policy\" of the Regulations in three subsections. Subsection 391.1 stated that it was \"highly important to the interest of the United States that no person be employed in the Department who is disloyal or who constitutes a security risk.\" Subsection 391.2 stated that so far as the Regulations related to the handling of loyalty cases, they were promulgated in accordance with Executive Order No. 9835, which had recognized the \"necessity for removing disloyal employees from the Federal service and for refusing employment therein to disloyal persons,\" and the \"obligation to protect employees and applicants from unfounded accusations of disloyalty.\" Subsection 391.3 referred to the language of the McCarran Rider, noting that the Secretary of State had been granted by Congress the right, in his absolute discretion, \"to terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the Department of State or of the Foreign Service of the United States whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.\" \"In the exercise of this right,\" the subsection concluded, \"the Department will, so far as possible,\n15\n afford its employees the same protection as those provided under the Loyalty Program.\" And, as we shall see hereafter, the Regulations made no provision for action by the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 375]\n\u00a0\n Secretary himself, under the McCarran Rider or otherwise, except following unfavorable action in the employee's case by the Department Loyalty Security Board, after full hearing before that Board on the charges against him, and approval of the Board's action by the Deputy Under Secretary.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nIn May and September 1951, prior to the time of petitioner's discharge, the Regulations were revised, and the amended 391 provided even more explicitly than the original that the procedures and standards established were intended to govern exercise of the authority granted by the McCarran Rider. After stating in the first subsection\n17\n that the Regulations were adopted to implement the Department's policy that \"no person be employed in the Department\n18\n who is disloyal or who constitutes a security risk,\" the section continues in the next two subsections\n19\n to state in effect that the Regulations relating to the handling of loyalty cases were promulgated in accordance with Executive Order No. 9835, and that those relating to security cases were promulgated under \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 376]\n\u00a0\n the authority of the Act of August 26, 1950\n20\n and the McCarran Rider.\n21\n The phrase \"so far as possible,\" in reference to McCarran Rider authority, was deleted. The Regulations thus drew upon all the sources of authority available to the Secretary with reference to such cases, and purported to set forth definitively the procedures and standards to be followed in their handling.\n\nB. \nThe Administrative Proceedings in this Case.\n\nThe administrative proceedings held in petitioner's case were unquestionably conducted on the premise that the Regulations were applicable in this instance. The charges were based on the Regulations, and a copy of the Regulations was sent to Service along with the letter of charges. The hearing was scheduled under 395 of the 1949 Regulations. In its opinion exonerating Service, the Department Board noted, following the Regulations, that \"the issues here are (1) loyalty, and (2) security risk.\" The Board's favorable recommendations came twice before the Deputy Under Secretary for review under 395.6 and 396.7 of these Regulations, and were approved by him. Later, before the Civil Service Commission's Loyalty Review Board, an additional charge was added to the Department's original charges by stipulation of the parties, and the stipulation expressly referred to 392.2 and 393.1a of the Regulations. Indeed, at no time during any of the administrative proceedings \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 377]\n\u00a0\n in this case was there any suggestion that the Regulations were not applicable to the entire proceedings and binding upon all parties to the case.\n\nC. \nThe Department's Representations to Congress.\n\nIn the spring of 1950, the Department of State submitted to an investigating subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a comprehensive report on the procedures and standards used by the Department in dealing with employee loyalty and security problems. After describing the procedures utilized by the Department in the early post-war period, the report continued as follows:\n\n  \". . . The policy of the Department prior to the  passage of the McCarran rider was that if there was  reasonable doubt as to an employee's loyalty, his  employment was required to be terminated. The  McCarran rider freed the hands of the Department  in making this policy effective. Basically any reasonable  doubt of an employee's loyalty if based on  substantial evidence was to be resolved in favor of  the Government. After enactment of the McCarran  rider the Department did not contemplate that the  legislation required or that the people of this country  would countenance the use of `Gestapo' methods or  harassment or persecution of loyal employees who  were American citizens on flimsy evidence or hearsay  and innuendo. The Department proceeded to develop  appropriate procedures designed to implement  fully and properly the authority granted the Department  under the McCarran rider.\n\n\n  \"The McCarran rider . . . was the first of a series  of provisions included in each subsequent appropriation  act which authorized the Secretary of State in  his absolute discretion to `terminate the employment \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 378]\n\u00a0\n  of any officer or employee of the Department of State  or of the Foreign Service of the United States whenever  he shall deem such termination necessary or  advisable in the interests of the United States.'  Accordingly, effective during the 1947 fiscal year, and  each fiscal year thereafter, the Department considered  the McCarran rider as an additional standard  for dealing with security problems in the Department.  . . . In [its] considered view the McCarran  rider was subject to procedural limitations. The  McCarran rider was not interpreted as permitting  reckless discharge or the exercise of arbitrary whims.\n\n\n .   .   .   .  .\n\n\n  \"The President's loyalty order of March 21, 1947,  prescribed a comprehensive set of standards governing  the executive branch as a whole. It was deemed  applicable to the Department of State, as well as to  other agencies. The unique powers conferred on the  Department as a result of continuous reenactment of  the McCarran rider led the Department to promulgate  regulations which would encompass its duties  and powers both under the Executive order and under  the McCarran rider.\"\n22\n\u00a0\n\n\nD. \nThe President's Letter.\n\nThat the policy of the Secretary to subject his plenary powers under the McCarran Rider to procedural limitations was deliberately adopted, and rested on decisions taken at the highest level, is evidenced by a letter dated September 6, 1950, from President Truman to the Secretary of State, which was made a part of the record below. In that letter, the President advised the Secretary that he had just approved H. R. 7786, the General Appropriation Act, 1951, 64 Stat. 595, 768, 1213 of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 379]\n\u00a0\n which re-enacted the McCarran Rider for the current fiscal year. The President continued:\n\n  \"I am sure you will agree that in exercising the  discretion conferred upon you by Section 1213, every  effort should be made to protect the national security  without unduly jeopardizing the personal liberties of  the employees within your jurisdiction. Procedures  designed to accomplish these two objectives are set  forth in Public Law 733, 81st Congress, which authorizes  the summary suspension of civilian officers and  employees of various departments and agencies of  the Government, including the Department of State.\n\n\n  \"In order that officers and employees of the  Department of State may be afforded the same protection  as that afforded by Public Law 733, it is my  desire that you follow the procedures set forth in that  law in carrying out the provisions of section 1213 of  the General Appropriations Act.\"\n\n\n In view of the terms of the Regulations, the course of procedure followed by the Department, and the background materials we have noted, we think that there is no room for doubt that the departmental Regulations for the handling of loyalty and security cases were both intended and considered by the Department to apply in this instance. We cannot accept either of the respondents' present arguments to the contrary. The first argument, as put by the District Court, whose language was adopted by the Court of Appeals,\n23\n is:\n\n  \". . . It was not the intent of Congress that  the Secretary of State bind himself to follow the  provisions of Executive Order 9835 in dismissing  employees under Public Law 188. This power of  summary dismissal would not have been granted the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 380]\n\u00a0\n  Secretary of State by the Congress if the Congress  was satisfied that the interests of this country were  adequately protected by Executive Order 9835.\"\n\n\n We gather from this that the lower courts thought that the Secretary was powerless to bind himself by these Regulations as to McCarran Rider discharges based on loyalty or security grounds. We do not think this is so. Although Congress was advised in unmistakable terms that the Secretary had seen fit to limit by regulations the discretion conferred upon him, see pp. 377-378, supra, it continued to re-enact the McCarran Rider without change for several succeeding years.\n24\n Cf. Labor Board v. Gullett Gin Co., \n340 \nU.S. 361, 366\n; Fleming v. Mohawk Co., \n331 \nU.S. 111, 116\n. Nor do we see any inconsistency between this statute and the effect of the Regulations upon the Secretary under Accardi v. Shaughnessy, \n347 \nU.S. 260\n, already discussed, pp. 372-373, supra. Accardi, indeed, involved statutory authority as broad as that involved here.\n25\n\u00a0\n\nThe respondents' second argument is that the Regulations refer explicitly to discharges based on loyalty and security grounds, but make no reference to discharges \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 381]\n\u00a0\n deemed \"necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States\" - the sole McCarran Rider standard - and hence were not applicable to such discharges. But, as has already been demonstrated, both the Regulations and their historical context show that the Regulations were applicable to McCarran Rider discharges, at least to the extent that they were based on loyalty or security grounds, and we do not see how it could seriously be considered, as the respondents now seem to urge, that Service was not discharged on such grounds. The Secretary's affidavit,\n26\n and also the Department's formal notice to Service of his discharged,\n27\n both of which, among other things, refer to Executive Order No. 9835 as well as to the McCarran Rider as authority for the Secretary's action, unmistakably show that the discharge was based on such grounds. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 382]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe now turn to the question whether the manner of petitioner's discharge was consistent with the Department's Regulations.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nPreliminarily, it must be noted that the parties are in dispute as to which of the two sets of Regulations - those of 1949 or those of 1951 - is applicable to petitioner's case, assuming, as we have held, that one or the other must govern. The departmental proceedings against petitioner were begun and were conducted under the 1949 Regulations. However, prior to petitioner's discharge in December 1951, the revised Regulations of May and September 1951 had become effective, and it is under those Regulations, the respondents say, that Service's discharge must be judged.\n28\n On the other hand, the petitioner contends that the 1949 Regulations remained applicable to his case, since he was not advised of the existence of the 1951 Regulations until after his discharge had been accomplished and the present court proceedings had been commenced.\n29\n However, it is unnecessary for us to make a choice between the two sets of Regulations, for we find the manner in which petitioner was discharged to have been inconsistent with both. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 383]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA. \nThe 1949 Regulations.\n\nIn terms of the 1949 Regulations, the vice we find in petitioner's discharge is that the Secretary had no right to dismiss the petitioner for loyalty or security reasons unless and until the Deputy Under Secretary, acting upon the findings of the Department's Loyalty Security Board, had recommended such dismissal. In other words, the Deputy Under Secretary in this instance having approved the findings of the Loyalty Security Board favorable to petitioner, the Secretary, consistently with these Regulations, could not, without more, dismiss the petitioner.\n\nThe basis for this conclusion will appear from a consideration of the procedural scheme established by the 1949 Regulations relating to loyalty and security cases. In outline that scheme involved the following procedural steps:\n\n (1) The filing of charges, upon notice to the employee involved, accompanied by adequate factual details as to their basis, and a statement as to the employee's work and pay status pending further action.\n30\n\u00a0\n\n\n (2) A hearing on such charges, if requested by the employee, before the Department's Loyalty Security Board, whose determination, together with the record of the hearings, were then to be forwarded to the Deputy Under Secretary for review.\n31\n\u00a0\n\n\n (3) Upon such review the Deputy Under Secretary was empowered (i) to return the case to the Board for further investigation or action; (ii) to decide in favor of the employee, and to so notify him \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 384]\n\u00a0\n in writing; or (iii) to decide against the employee, and to notify him of his right to appeal to the Secretary within 10 days thereafter.\n32\n\u00a0\n\n\n (4) In the event of such an appeal, the Secretary was empowered (i) to decide favorably to the employee, and to so notify him in writing; or (ii) to decide against the employee, and to notify him of such decision, and further, in a loyalty case, of his right to appeal to the Loyalty Review Board within 20 days thereafter.\n33\n\u00a0\n\n\n (5) If, upon such an appeal, the Loyalty Review Board decided adversely to the employee and made an \"advisory\" recommendation to the Secretary that the employee should be removed from employment under the applicable loyalty standards, the Department was to take prompt administrative action to that end. On the other hand if the Board decided favorably to the employee the Secretary was empowered (i) to restore the employee to duty and \"close the case\"; (ii) to permit the employee to resign; or (iii) to terminate his employment under the authority conferred by the McCarran Rider \"or other appropriate authority.\"\n34\n\u00a0\n\n\n From this survey, three things appear as to the handling of loyalty and security cases under the 1949 Regulations which are of significance in this case. First, following the decision of the Deputy Under Secretary upon a determination of the Department Loyalty Security Board, there was to be an appeal to the Secretary only if the Deputy's action had been adverse to the employee. In other words, under these Regulations the action of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 385]\n\u00a0\n Deputy Under Secretary, if favorable to the employee, was to be final, the Secretary reserving to himself power to act further only if his Deputy's action was unfavorable to the employee.\n35\n Second, there was likewise an appeal to the Loyalty Review Board from the Secretary's decision only if his action was adverse to the employee. Again, in other words, a decision of the Secretary favorable to the employee was to be final, and immune from further action by the Loyalty Review Board on post-audit, a rule since confirmed by our decision in Peters v. Hobby, supra. Third, the Secretary reserved the right to deal with such a case under his McCarran Rider authority, outside the Regulations, only in instances where, upon an employee's appeal to the Loyalty Review Board from an unfavorable decision by the Secretary, the decision of that body was favorable to the employee.\n\nGranted, as the respondents argue, that these Regulations gave the petitioner (a) no right of appeal to the Secretary from the Deputy Under Secretary's favorable \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 386]\n\u00a0\n decision, and (b) no right of appeal at all from the action of the Loyalty Review Board, it does not follow, as the respondents then argue, that the Secretary was free to dismiss the petitioner. For, as has already been observed, the Regulations left the Secretary functus officio with respect to such cases once the Deputy Under Secretary had made a determination favorable to the employee. So here when the Deputy Under Secretary approved the Loyalty Security Board's action of July 31, 1951, clearing the petitioner, under these Regulations the case against Service was closed.\n36\n Hence Service's subsequent discharge by the Secretary must be deemed to have been in contravention of these 1949 Regulations.\n37\n The situation under the 1949 Regulations was thus closely analogous to that which obtained in Accardi v. Shaughnessy, supra. There, the Attorney General bound himself not to exercise his discretion until he had received an impartial recommendation from a subordinate board. Here, the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 387]\n\u00a0\n Secretary bound himself not to act at all in cases such as this, except upon appeal by employees from determinations unfavorable to them. We see no relevant ground for distinction.\n\nB. \nThe 1951 Regulations.\n\nA similar conclusion must be reached if the 1951 Regulations are deemed applicable to petitioner's case. Section 393.1 of those Regulations provides:\n\n  \"The standard for removal from employment in  the Department of State under the authority referred  to in section 391.3 shall be that on all the evidence  reasonable grounds exist for belief that the removal  of the officer or employee involved is necessary or  advisable in the interest of national security. The  decision shall be reached after consideration of the  complete file, arguments, briefs, and testimony presented.\"  (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n The \"authority referred to in section 391.3,\" as we have already noted, included the McCarran Rider.\n38\n In light of the former Secretary's affidavit\n39\n there is no room for dispute that no attempt was made to comply with this section of the Regulations,\n40\n as indeed the respondents' brief virtually concedes.\n\nThe respondents argue that this provision was not violated in petitioner's case because \"the only decision to which Section 393.1 relates is that the removal of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 388]\n\u00a0\n officer or employee involved is `necessary or advisable in the interest of national security,'\" the standard laid down in the Act of August 26, 1950,\n41\n and that \"[n]othing in this section purports to prescribe the procedure to be followed in determining that removal is `necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States,'\" the standard contained in the McCarran Rider. But since 391.3, which is incorporated by reference into 393.1, specifically subjected the exercise of the Secretary's McCarran Rider authority, in such cases as this, to the operation of the 1951 Regulations, it seems clear that the necessary effect of 393.1 was to subject the exercise of that authority to the substantive standards prescribed by that section, namely, those established by the Act of August 26, 1950,\n42\n and also to the procedural requirements that such cases must be decided \"on all the evidence\" and \"after consideration of the complete file, arguments, briefs, and testimony presented.\" The essential meaning of the section, in other words, was that the Secretary's decision was required to be on the merits. While it is of course true that under the McCarran Rider the Secretary was not obligated to impose upon himself these more rigorous substantive and procedural standards, neither was he prohibited from doing so, as we have already held, and having done so he could not, so long as the Regulations remained unchanged, proceed without regard to them.\n\nIt being clear that 393.1 was not complied with by the Secretary in this instance, it follows that under the Accardi doctrine petitioner's dismissal cannot stand, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 389]\n\u00a0\n regardless of whether the 1951, rather than the 1949, Regulations are deemed applicable in his case.\n43\n\u00a0\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed, and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE CLARK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, 40 Stat. 217, as amended.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 12 Fed.

Copies of the Opinions of both Boards are attached. \"The Department of State's Loyalty Security Board, on July 31, 1951, had reaffirmed its earlier findings that Service was neither disloyal nor a security risk, and the case had been referred to the Loyalty Review Board for post-audit on September 4, 1951. The Loyalty Review Board assumed jurisdiction of Mr. Service's case on October 9, 1951. \"The Chairman of the Loyalty Review Board in today's letter to the Secretary (full text attached) noted: \"`The Loyalty Review Board found no evidence of membership in the Communist Party or in any organization on the Attorney General's list on the part of John Stewart Service. The Loyalty Review Board did find that there is a reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the employee, John Stewart Service, to the Government of the United States, based on the intentional and unauthorized disclosure of documents and information of a confidential and non-public character within the meaning of subparagraph d of paragraph 2 of Part V, \"Standards,\" of Executive Order No. 9835, as amended.' \"The Opinion of the Loyalty Review Board stressed the points made above by the Chairman - that is, it stated that the Board was not required to find and did not find Mr. Service guilty of disloyalty, but it did find that his intentional and unauthorized \n\n[354 \nU.S. 363, 368]\n\u00a0\n disclosure of confidential documents raised reasonable doubt as to his loyalty. The State Department Board while censoring [sic] Mr. Service for indiscretions, believed that the experience Mr. Service had been through as a result of his indiscretions in 1945 had served to make him far more than normally security conscious. It found also that no reasonable doubt existed as to his loyalty to the Government of the United States. On this point the State Department Board was reversed. \"The Chairman of the Loyalty Review Board has requested the Secretary of State to advise the Board of the effective date of the separation of Mr. Service. This request stems from the provisions of Executive Orders 9835 and 10241 - which established the President's Loyalty Program - and the Regulations promulgated thereon. These Regulations are binding on the Department of State. \"The Department has advised the Chairman of the Loyalty Review Board that Mr. Service's employment has been terminated.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 65 Stat. 581.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] 60 Stat. 458.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See 61 Stat. 288, 62 Stat. 315, 63 Stat. 456, 64 Stat. 768, 65 Stat. 581, 66 Stat. 555. All of these provisions are referred to in this opinion as \"the McCarran Rider.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The District Court's opinion is unreported. Actually, the Secretary could be considered to have power to discharge petitioner as he did only by virtue of the McCarran Rider. Petitioner was an officer in the Foreign Service of the United States, and as such was entitled to the protection of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, as amended. 22 U.S.C. 801 et seq. That statute authorizes the Secretary of State to separate officers from the Foreign Service \"for unsatisfactory performance of duty,\" id., 1007, or for \"misconduct or malfeasance,\" id., 1008. However, under both sections, an officer may not be separated without a hearing before the Board of the Foreign Service established by 211 of the Act, 22 U.S.C. 826, and his unsatisfactory performance of duty or misconduct must be established at that hearing. No such hearing was ever afforded petitioner. Executive Order No. 9835 did not vest any additional authority in the heads of administrative agencies to discharge employees. It merely established new standards and procedures for effecting discharges under whatever independent legal authority existed for those discharges. Cf. Cole v. Young, \n351 \nU.S. 536, 543\n-544. The only statutory provision which could be deemed to authorize the Secretary to dismiss petitioner without observance of the provisions of the Foreign Service Act was therefore the McCarran Rider. The latter provision thus was an indispensable supplement to the Department's authority if it was to proceed against petitioner under the Loyalty-Security Regulations as it did. See p. 376, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See Peters v. Hobby, supra, \n349 \nU.S., at 342\n-343.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] U.S. Department of State, Manual of Regulations and Procedures (1949), 390 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] This qualification is without significance here in view of the fact that the petitioner's case before the Department was handled, down to the time of his discharge by the Secretary, under these Regulations. See p. 376, infra. Moreover, this phrase was deleted in the 1951 revision of the Regulations, as we note hereafter, p. 376, infra, and the respondents have insisted here that the 1951 revision is controlling, see p. 382, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] We follow the parties in this case in using interchangeably the terms \"Deputy Under Secretary\" and \"Assistant Secretary - Administration.\" When the Department's 1949 Regulations were promulgated, the official charged with duties under them was the \"Assistant Secretary - Administration.\" At some time thereafter, however, that official's functions were apparently transferred to a Deputy Under Secretary. Cf. Act of May 26, 1949, 3, 4, 63 Stat. 111. To avoid confusion, we have used exclusively the latter title in the text of this opinion, regardless of its technical correctness in the particular instance.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] \"391.1 Policy.\" For the Department's 1951 Regulations see U.S. Department of State, Manual of Regulations and Procedures (1951), Vol. I, 390 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] \"Department\" is defined as including \"the Foreign Service of the United States.\" 391.3.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] \"391.2 Loyalty Authority,\" and \"391.3 Security Authority.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] This statute is referred to in the subsection as \"Public Law 733, 81st Congress,\" being the Act of August 26, 1950, 64 Stat. 476, 5 U.S.C. 22-1, 22-3, which gave to the State Department, among other departments and agencies of the Government, suspension and dismissal powers over their civilian employees when deemed necessary \"in the interest of the national security of the United States.\" Cf.

The Loyalty Review Board further advised that it found no evidence of membership on your part in the Communist Party or in any organizations on the Attorney General's list. \"Pursuant to the foregoing, the Secretary of State, under the authority of Executive Order 9835, as amended, and Section 103 of Public Law 188, 82nd Congress, has directed me to terminate your employment in the Foreign Service of the United States as of the close of business December 14, 1951. \"In view thereof, you are advised that your employment in the Foreign Service of the United States is hereby terminated effective [at the] close of business December 14, 1951.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] The respondents argue that the proper rule to be applied is that of Vandenbark v.

Rep. No. 2108, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 254. Deputy Under Secretary of State John E. Peurifoy is there quoted as stating, in reply to charges made on the floor of the Senate: \". . . I am in full charge of loyalty matters and . . . am fully prepared to deal with these charges. \"Gen. George C. Marshall, as Secretary of State, vested in me full responsibility and authority for carrying out the loyalty and security program of the Department of State, and I have continued to exercise the same responsibility and authority under Secretary Dean Acheson. \"My decisions on matters of loyalty and security within the Department are final, subject, however, under the law, in certain instances to appeal to the Secretary and the President's Loyalty Review Board. Since the loyalty and security program was launched in the Department, however, there has not been a single instance in which a decision made by me has been reversed or overruled in any way by Secretary Acheson.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] Section 396.7 of the Regulations provided: \"If the Assistant Secretary - Administration or the Secretary of State shall, during his consideration of any case, decide affirmatively that an officer or employee is not disloyal and does not constitute a security risk and that his case should be closed, such officer or employee shall be restored to duty, if suspended, and the record shall show such decision.\" In holding as we do we by no means imply that under these Regulations the action of the Deputy Under Secretary had the effect of \"closing\" petitioner's case irrevocably and beyond hope of recall. No doubt proper steps could have been taken to reopen it in the Department. But, consistent with his Regulations, we think that the Secretary could in no event have discharged the petitioner, as he did here, without the required action first having been taken by the Department's Loyalty Security Board and the Deputy Under Secretary.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] In view of this conclusion, it becomes unnecessary to consider the other respects in which petitioner claims that his discharge contravened the 1949 Regulations.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 38\n] See pp. 375-376, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 39\n] See pp. 368-369, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 40\n] We do not, of course, imply that the Regulations precluded the Secretary from discharging any individual without personally reading the \"complete file\" and considering \"all the evidence.\" No doubt the Secretary could delegate that duty.

The complaint alleged fraudulent wastage of the assets of Warner Bros., the plaintiff's corporation, for the benefit of a son-in-law of one of its directors and the son-in-law's corporation. It alleged that a demand on the directors of Warner Bros. to institute the suit was not made because it would have been futile, since all or a majority of them had approved the contracts involved. The District Court found that (1) the contracts were made in good faith and without fraud, (2) the stockholders, officers or directors were not \"antagonistic to the financial interests\" of Warner Bros., (3) none of the directors \"wrongfully participated\" in the acts complained of, and (4) if a demand had been made on Warner Bros. to institute suit, the management would not have been disqualified \"from faithfully doing their duty,\" but that \"such a demand would have been futile.\" On these grounds, the District Court realigned Warner Bros. as a party plaintiff and dismissed the bill for want of diversity jurisdiction.

On the briefs were Mr. Williams and Ralph E. Lewis for Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., et al., and Mr. Schwab, Marvin Sears and Norman Altman for United States Pictures, Inc., et al., respondents.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis suit was filed in a Federal District Court in California by reason of diversity of citizenship. It is a stockholder's derivative suit. The first cause of action, the only one involved here, is based on alleged fraudulent wastage of assets of Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. (which we will call Warner Bros.) for the benefit of one Sperling, a son-in-law of a director of Warner Bros., and United States Pictures, Inc. (which we will call United), the son-in-law's corporation. Extended allegations are made concerning various agreements between Warner Bros. and United which, it is charged, are unfair to Warner Bros. Demand on the directors of Warner Bros. to institute this action was not made because, it is averred, such a demand would be futile since, inter alia, all or a majority of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 93]\n\u00a0\n board of directors approved the contracts. The plaintiff is a citizen of New York;\n1\n the defendant directors are citizens of California; and Warner Bros. and United are Delaware corporations.\n\nThe complaint joined Warner Bros. as a defendant. It was urged before the District Court, and it is claimed here, that since the cause of action sought to be enforced is one that belongs to the corporation and since the corporation is not \"antagonistic\" to the stockholder within the meaning of that term as used in Doctor v. Harrington, \n196 \nU.S. 579, 588\n, Warner Bros. should be realigned as plaintiff. In that event there would be no diversity of citizenship since Delaware corporations would be on both sides of the lawsuit. Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267.\n\nThe District Court held a hearing on the issue - a hearing that lasted 15 days. It found:\n\n(1) that the contracts in controversy were made in good faith and without fraud; that they were considered by the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 94]\n\u00a0\n directors to be in the best interests of Warner Bros. and that, in approving them, they exercised their best business judgment;\n\n(2) that Warner Bros. was not under the domination or control of the Warners on the board; and that the stockholders, officers, or directors were not \"antagonistic to the financial interests\" of Warner Bros.;\n\n(3) that neither all nor a majority nor any of the directors and officers of Warner Bros. \"wrongfully participated\" in the acts complained of; that the board was not dominated or controlled by the Warners and Sperling or by any one or more of them;\n\n(4) that if demand had been made on Warner Bros. to institute suit, the management would not have been disqualified \"from faithfully doing their duty\" as officers and directors but that \"such a demand would have been futile.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\nFor these reasons the District Court realigned Warner Bros. as a party plaintiff and dismissed the bill. 117 F. Supp. 781. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 237 F.2d 317. The case is here on a writ of certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 865\n.\n\nThis is a corporate cause of action brought by a stockholder. Whether it is a proper case for assertion by a stockholder of that cause of action is not the question here. Such was the problem involved in Hawes v. Oakland, \n104 \nU.S. 450\n, upon which so much reliance is placed in supporting the court below. Here we assume that this corporate cause of action may be enforced by the stockholder. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 95]\n\u00a0\n We are concerned only with a question of federal diversity jurisdiction.\n\nThe gist of the findings of the District Court is that since there was no fraud on the part of the directors in making the contracts but only an exercise of independent business judgment, the management was not antagonistic to the financial interests of the corporation. That is an issue that goes to the merits, not to the question of jurisdiction. There will, of course, be antagonism between the stockholder and the management where the dominant officers and directors are guilty of fraud or misdeeds. But wrongdoing in that sense is not the sole measure of antagonism. There is antagonism whenever the management is aligned against the stockholder and defends a course of conduct which he attacks. The charge normally is cast in terms of fraud, breach of trust, or illegality. See Doctor v. Harrington, supra; Venner v. Great Northern R. Co., \n209 \nU.S. 24\n; Koster v. (American) Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., \n330 \nU.S. 518, 522\n, 523. The answer, of course, always denies the charge of wrongdoing. To stop and try the charge of wrongdoing is to delve into the merits. That does not seem to us to be the proper course. It is a time-consuming, wasteful exertion of energy on a preliminary issue in the case. The instant case is a good illustration, for it has been over eight years in the courts on this question of jurisdiction.\n\nSince our decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, the law which governs the merits in these derivative actions is local law. Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541, 555\n-556. The result, then, of the approach followed by the court below is to have more than a preliminary trial on matters going to the merits of the controversy. Obviously federal law would govern the preliminary trial on the issues of wrongdoing, for that matter goes to the question of federal jurisdiction. Yet should the District Court decide those issues in favor of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 96]\n\u00a0\n the stockholder, a second trial on the merits will require that the same issues be tried out according to the set of rules supplied by local law.\n\nIt seems to us that the proper course is not to try out the issues presented by the charges of wrongdoing but to determine the issue of antagonism on the face of the pleadings and by the nature of the controversy. The bill and answer normally determine whether the management is antagonistic to the stockholder, as Central R. Co. v. Mills, \n113 \nU.S. 249\n, and Doctor v. Harrington, supra, indicate.\n3\n The management may refuse or fail to act for any number of reasons. Fraud may be one; the reluctance to take action against a close business associate may be another; honest belief in the wisdom of the course of action which the management has approved may be still another; and so on. As the Court said in Delaware & Hudson Co. v. Albany & S. R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 435, 451\n, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 97]\n\u00a0\n where the management was deemed to be antagonistic to the stockholder, \"The attitude of the directors need not be sinister. It may be sincere.\" Whenever the management refuses to take action to undo a business transaction or whenever, as in this case, it so solidly approves it that any demand to rescind would be futile, antagonism is evident. The cause of action, to be sure, is that of the corporation. But the corporation has become through its managers hostile and antagonistic to the enforcement of the claim.\n\nCollusion to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of the District Courts may, of course, always be shown;\n4\n and it will always defeat jurisdiction. Absent collusion, there is diversity jurisdiction when the real collision of issues, Indianapolis v. Chase National Bank, \n314 \nU.S. 63, 69\n, or as stated in Helm v. Zarecor, \n222 \nU.S. 32, 36\n, \"the actual controversy,\" is between citizens of different States. This is a practical not a mechanical determination and is resolved by the pleadings and the nature of the dispute.\n\nHere it is plain that the stockholder and those who manage the corporation are completely and irrevocably opposed on a matter of corporate practice and policy. A trial may demonstrate that the stockholder is wrong and the management right. It may show a dispute that lies in the penumbra of business judgment, unaffected by fraud. But that issue goes to the merits, not to jurisdiction. There is jurisdiction if there is real collision between \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 98]\n\u00a0\n the stockholder and his corporation. That there is such a collision is evident here.\n\nThe judgment must therefore be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] While the action was pending plaintiff died and for him a special administrator has been substituted. The latter is a citizen of California. Had the suit been originally commenced by the decedent's representative, it would have been the citizenship of the representative which would have been determinative of jurisdiction in this diversity case. See Chappedelaine v. Dechenaux, 4 Cranch 306; Childress v. Emory, 8 Wheat. 642, 669; Mexican Central R. Co. v. Eckman, \n187 \nU.S. 429, 434\n; Mecom v. Fitzsimmons Drilling Co., \n284 \nU.S. 183, 186\n. But jurisdiction, once attached, is not impaired by a party's later change of domicile. Mollan v. Torrance, 9 wheat. 537. As Chief Justice Marshall said in that case: \"It is quite clear, that the jurisdiction of the Court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought, and that after vesting, it cannot be ousted by subsequent events.\" Id., p. 539. The rationale, that jurisdiction is tested by the facts as they existed when the action is brought, is applied to a situation where a party dies and a non-diverse representative is substituted. Dunn v. Clarke, 8 Pet. 1 (1834).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The bill therefore meets the requirements of Rule 23 (b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure that the stockholder show with particularity what efforts he made to get those who control the corporation to take action, \"and the reasons for his failure to obtain such action or the reasons for not making such effort.\" And see Hawes v. Oakland, \n104 \nU.S. 450\n; Delaware & Hudson Co. v. Albany & S. R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 435\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Court in Doctor v. Harrington, supra, at p. 587, said, \"The ultimate interest of the corporation made defendant may be the same as that of the stockholder made plaintiff, but the corporation may be under a control antagonistic to him, and made to act in a way detrimental to his rights. In other words, his interests, and the interests of the corporation, may be made subservient to some illegal purpose. If a controversy hence arise, and the other conditions of jurisdiction exist, it can be litigated in a Federal court.\" The complaint in that case charged fraud by a dominant director and stockholder to his advantage and to the detriment of the minority stockholders. The answer denied the fraud. The Court did not stop, as the District Court did in the instant case, to inquire if transactions complained of were colorable or were sustained by sound business judgment. After reviewing the earlier decisions, the Court concluded, \"The case at bar is brought within the doctrine of those cases by the allegations of the bill.\" Id., p. 588. The leading case cited by the Court was Hawes v. Oakland, \n104 \nU.S. 450\n, where in determining whether a proper case for a derivative action had been made out, the Court looked only to the nature of the charges contained in the bill. Id., pp. 461-462.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 28 U.S.C. 1359 provides: \"A district court shall not have jurisdiction of a civil action in which any party, by assignment or otherwise, has been improperly or collusively made or joined to invoke the jurisdiction of such court.\" Collusion is shown, for example, where the neglect or refusal of the directors to take the desired action on the part of the corporation is simulated so that it may be made to appear that the diversity of citizenship necessary for federal jurisdiction exists. Detroit v. Dean, \n106 \nU.S. 537\n; Quincy v. Steel, \n120 \nU.S. 241\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.Fn\n\nThe Court holds that, collusion aside, whenever a corporation refuses to bring a suit and a derivative suit is brought by a stockholder on its behalf, the corporation is always to be aligned as a defendant for purposes of determining diversity jurisdiction. The Court thus makes the exception the rule, and by confounding the requirements for establishing a substantive cause of action with the requirements of diversity jurisdiction, it overturns a half-century's precedents in this Court. The scope and significance of this undoing cannot be appreciated without a brief review of the history of the jurisdictional adjudications - which control the present cases - and of the wholly different precedents establishing the substantive rules that govern stockholders' suits when there is unquestionable jurisdiction in the constitutional sense. It will also be necessary to set forth generous portions of the opinions of the Court in prior cases to demonstrate that not only do they not support the Court's view but that they are being overturned by it.\n\nThe present cases involve the jurisdiction of the federal courts, and that question alone. No aspect of the substantive cause of action is before us. At the outset, two guiding principles governing this litigation must be kept clearly in mind: (1) These are constitutional cases, involving the \"judicial power\" of the United States over \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 99]\n\u00a0\n controversies \"between citizens of different States.\" (2) These are stockholders' suits; the stockholder sues not in his own right but in the right and on behalf of the corporation.\n\nThe contrasting difference between a stockholder's suit for his corporation and a suit by him against it, is crucial. In the former, he has no claim of his own; he merely has a personal controversy with his corporation regarding the business wisdom or legal basis for the latter's assertion of a claim against third parties. Whatever money or property is to be recovered would go to the corporation, not a fraction of it to the stockholder. When such a suit is entertained, the stockholder is in effect allowed to conscript the corporation as a complainant on a claim that the corporation, in the exercise of what it asserts to be its uncoerced discretion, is unwilling to initiate. This is a wholly different situation from that which arises when the corporation is charged with invasion of the stockholder's independent right. Thus, for instance, if a corporation rearranges the relationship of different classes of security holders to the detriment of one class, a stockholder in the disadvantaged class may proceed against the corporation as a defendant to protect his own legal interest.\n\nThe basic principles of diversity jurisdiction, often stated, obviously bear repeating:\n\n\"To sustain diversity jurisdiction there must exist an `actual,' Helm v. Zarecor, \n222 \nU.S. 32, 36\n, `substantial,' Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Iron Moulders Union, \n254 \nU.S. 77, 81\n, controversy between citizens of different states, all of whom on one side of the controversy are citizens of different states from all parties on the other side. Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267. Diversity jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon the federal courts by the parties' own \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 100]\n\u00a0\n determination of who are plaintiffs and who defendants. It is our duty, as it is that of the lower federal courts, to `look beyond the pleadings and arrange the parties according to their sides in the dispute.' Dawson v. Columbia Trust Co., \n197 \nU.S. 178, 180\n.\" Indianapolis v. Chase National Bank, \n314 \nU.S. 63, 69\n.\n\n\n The initial and leading case dealing with the alignment of parties for jurisdictional purposes in a stockholder's suit is Doctor v. Harrington, \n196 \nU.S. 579\n. That was a suit by stockholders against two individuals alleged to control the company in question and a third-party corporation. Realigning the corporation as a plaintiff, the Circuit Court held that there was no diversity, and it dismissed the bill for lack of jurisdiction. This Court reversed. After stating that Equity Rule 94 (now Rule 23 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) contemplated suits \"brought by a stockholder in a corporation founded on rights which may properly be asserted by the corporation,\" the Court went on to indicate what must have been the basis for aligning the corporation in that case as a defendant:\n\n\"And the decisions of this court establish that such a suit, when between citizens of different States, involves a controversy cognizable in a Circuit Court of the United States. The ultimate interest of the corporation made defendant may be the same as that of the stockholder made plaintiff, but the corporation may be under a control antagonistic to him, and made to act in a way detrimental to his rights. In other words, his interests, and the interests of the corporation, may be made subservient to some illegal purpose. If a controversy hence arise, and the other conditions of jurisdiction exist, it can be litigated in a Federal court.\" \n196 \nU.S., at 587\n. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 101]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Court then went on to discuss these other \"conditions of jurisdiction,\" i. e., the complainants' compliance with the substantive and procedural requirements of Equity Rule 94. In refusing to realign, the Court did not state that mere refusal to sue on the part of the corporation was a sufficient reason to align the corporation as a defendant. The Court referred to \"antagonistic\" control and the stockholder's \"interests, and the interests of the corporation\" being made \"subservient to some illegal purpose.\"\n\nThis question of what constitutes \"antagonistic\" control is the crux of the present cases. The District Court in No. 316, in the course of its thorough opinion, stated:\n\n \"For a corporation to be `in antagonistic hands,' . . . or to have a `hostile attitude,'. . . such as would permit alignment on the side against its presumptive financial interests, surely requires more than a mere argument or difference of opinion between the corporation and the suing stockholder as to the desirability of bringing the suit. Patently, if difference of opinion were all the `controversy' required to be shown between the stockholder and his corporation in order to preclude alignment of the latter with the plaintiff-stockholder, then there can be no occasion for all the pages of discussion of corporate domination or control, since every stockholder's derivative suit is by definition predicated upon the assumption that the corporation has refused to sue.\" 117 F. Supp. 781, 802.\n\n\n This has been the view that this Court has consistently taken since Doctor v. Harrington. Three years later, Doctor v. Harrington was reaffirmed and its basis made clear in Venner v. Great Northern R. Co., \n209 \nU.S. 24\n. That was a stockholder's suit brought in a state court \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 102]\n\u00a0\n against the Great Northern Railroad and its President, James J. Hill, with an allegation that the `railroad and its board of directors were under his absolute control.\" Id., at 29. Both defendants were citizens of the same State. They removed the case into the federal court and the plaintiff, claiming that the corporation should be realigned, sought remand to the state court on the ground that the federal court lacked jurisdiction. The Court, if such was its thought, obviously would have said simpliciter that since the corporation refused to sue, the corporation must be aligned as a defendant. It did not do so. The whole thought of Mr. Justice Moody's opinion is completely contrary.\n\n\"Let it be assumed for the purposes of this decision that the court may disregard the arrangement of parties made by the pleader, and align them upon the side where their interest in and attitude to the controversy really places them, and then may determine the jurisdictional question in view of this alignment. [Citing the Removal Cases, \n100 \nU.S. 457\n, and other cases.] If this rule should be applied it would leave the parties here where the pleader has arranged them. It would doubtless be for the financial interests of the defendant railroad that the plaintiff should prevail. But that is not enough. Both defendants unite, as sufficiently appears by the petition and other proceedings, in resisting the plaintiff's claim of illegality and fraud. They are alleged to have engaged in the same illegal and fraudulent conduct, and the injury is alleged to have been accomplished by their joint action. The plaintiff's controversy is with both, and both are rightfully and necessarily made defendants, and neither can, for jurisdictional purposes, be regarded otherwise than as a defendant. . . .\" Id., at 31-32. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 103]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n To make explicit the case's relation to the prior case of Doctor v. Harrington, the Court continued:\n\n\"The case of Doctor v. Harrington is precisely in point on this branch of the case, and is conclusive. In that case the plaintiffs, stockholders in a corporation, brought an action in the Circuit Court against the corporation and Harrington, another stockholder, `who directed the management of the affairs of the corporation, dictated its policy, and selected its directors.' It was alleged that Harrington fraudulently caused the corporation to make its promissory note without consideration, obtained a judgment on the note, and sold, on execution, for much less than their real value, the assets of the corporation to persons acting for his benefit. On the face of the pleadings there was the necessary diversity of citizenship, but it was insisted that the corporation, because its interest was the same as that of the plaintiff, should be regarded as a plaintiff. The court below so aligned the corporation defendant, and, as that destroyed the diversity of citizenship, dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction. This court reversed the decree, saying [the quotation is of the part of the Court's opinion in Doctor, quoted supra, p. 100]. There was therefore in the case at bar the diversity of citizenship which confers jurisdiction.\" Id., at 32-33.\n\n\n The jurisdictional doctrine of Doctor v. Harrington, as reaffirmed and elaborated in Venner v. Great Northern R. Co., was accepted without question only ten years ago in Koster v. Lumbermens Mutual Co., \n330 \nU.S. 518\n. The Court in that case summarized the jurisdictional doctrine of alignment of parties in stockholders' suits:\n\n \"The cause of action which such a plaintiff brings before the court is not his own but the corporation's. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 104]\n\u00a0\n It is the real party in interest and he is allowed to act in protection of its interest somewhat as a `next friend' might do for an individual, because it is disabled from protecting itself. If, however, such a case as this were treated as other actions, the federal court would realign the parties for jurisdictional purposes according to their real interests. In this case, which is typical of many, this would put [the corporation] on the plaintiff's side. . . . and jurisdiction would be ousted. Indianapolis v. Chase National Bank, \n314 \nU.S. 63\n. But jurisdiction is saved in this class of cases by a special dispensation because the corporation is in antagonistic hands. Doctor v. Harrington, \n196 \nU.S. 579\n.\" Id., at 522-523.\n\n\n Mr. Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court throws further light on what is meant by \"antagonistic hands\" by characterizing \"the real party in interest,\" the corporation, as \"disabled from protecting itself.\" That cannot mean anything else except what the Venner case, quoting from Doctor v. Harrington, set forth as the reason for disablement, viz., that the very individuals who have a stranglehold over the corporation are the people against whom suit is sought to be brought and, therefore, in any sense that has any meaning, they are the defendants for that reason. And it is not merely that the obvious sense of the foregoing paragraph quoted from Koster gives the significance to Doctor v. Harrington that Venner gave it. That meaning is reinforced by the Court's succeeding reference to a stockholder's interest in \"bringing faithless managers to book.\" Id., at 524.\n\nIn the District Court in No. 316, Smith v. Sperling, Judge Mathes made an exhaustive survey of all the precedents relating to the jurisdictional test to be applied in stockholders' suits, 117 F. Supp. 781, aff'd, 237 F.2d 317, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 105]\n\u00a0\n and stated the jurisdictional test to be derived from the cases as follows:\n\n \"If the corporation has suffered actionable wrong and is `in antagonistic hands' - i. e. so dominated that it is incapacitated to act in keeping with its own financial interests - then a federal court should not, because of such disability, align the corporation with the plaintiff-stockholder in determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists.\" 117 F. Supp., at 801.\n\n\n The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit took the same view in No. 149, Swanson v. Traer, 230 F.2d 228, 237.\n\nThe jurisdictional rules that the Court has laid down for over half a century - emerging from all the cases and not merely from Doctor v. Harrington standing by itself - do not represent a capricious or formalistic determination as to when there is or is not diversity jurisdiction. On the contrary, they represent a true appreciation of the nature of the stockholder's suit and a faithful application of well-settled principles of diversity jurisdiction: when a suit is brought that is in fact and in law the corporation's, the corporation from the nature of the cause of action is a plaintiff and must appear among the plaintiffs, except when the corporation is in fact the tool of the very people against whom a judgment is sought. In the latter circumstances the corporation is merely a compendious name for the controlling defendants who are hiding behind it.\n\nThe Court, purporting to interpret this half-century of precedents, sweeps them away. In so doing, it greatly expands the diversity jurisdiction. \"Antagonism\" is a difficult standard to meet and is a more unusual situation. Refusal to sue provides automatic entry. Moreover, whenever the corporation and the real defendants are of the same citizenship, there would be no diversity jurisdiction \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 106]\n\u00a0\n unless antagonism could be shown. No similar restriction on jurisdiction is made because of possible non-diverseness of the stockholder and the corporation defendant because it is generally not too difficult to find a non-diverse stockholder to institute suit.\n\nThe Court professes to do no more than to apply well-settled precedents. But the well-settled precedents that are applied have absolutely \"nothing to do with the case.\" The Court has found support in the line of cases that deal solely with substantive requirements or with the procedural rules for establishing compliance with those requirements. These have nothing to do with the constitutional jurisdiction of the federal courts in diversity suits.\n\nPrior to the Judiciary Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 470, there was only very limited federal question jurisdiction in the District Courts. See Hart and Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, 727-730. Moreover, diversity jurisdiction was established on the basis of the alignment set forth in the pleadings. Removal Cases, \n100 \nU.S. 457, 469\n. If a corporation desiring to bring suit could not come within the requirements of diversity jurisdiction, the only way its suit could be tried in the federal courts, prior to the vast enlargement of their jurisdiction by the Act of 1875, was by virtue of a suit brought on its behalf by a stockholder of the requisite citizenship. This was the procedure followed in the important case of Dodge v. Woolsey, the Court noting that any suspected issue of contrivance should have been alleged and proved by the defendant. 18 How. 331, 346.\n\nThe result of this practice was described by Mr. Justice Miller for the Court in the leading case of Hawes v. Oakland, \n104 \nU.S. 450, 452\n.\n\n \"Since the decision of this court in Dodge v. Woolsey . . . the frequency with which the most ordinary \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 107]\n\u00a0\n and usual chancery remedies are sought in the Federal courts by a single stockholder of a corporation who possesses the requisite citizenship, in cases where the corporation whose rights are to be enforced cannot sue in those courts, seems to justify a consideration of the grounds on which that case was decided, and of the just limitations of the exercise of those principles.\n\n\n \"This practice has grown until the corporations created by the laws of the States bring a large part of their controversies with their neighbors and fellow-citizens into the courts of the United States for adjudication, instead of resorting to the State courts, which are their natural, their lawful, and their appropriate forum. . . . A corporation having such a controversy, which it is foreseen must end in litigation, and preferring for any reason whatever that this litigation shall take place in a Federal court, in which it can neither sue its real antagonist nor be sued by it, has recourse to a holder of one of its shares, who is a citizen of another State. This stockholder is called into consultation, and is told that his corporation has rights which the directors refuse to enforce or to protect. He instantly demands of them to do their duty in this regard, which of course they fail or refuse to do, and thereupon he discovers that he has two causes of action entitling him to equitable relief in a court of chancery; namely, one against his own company . . . for refusing to do what he has requested them to do; and the other against the party which contests the matter in controversy with that corporation. These two causes of action he combines in an equity suit in the Circuit Court of the United States, because he is a citizen of a different State, though the real parties to the controversy \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 108]\n\u00a0\n could have no standing in that court. . . . the whole case is prepared for hearing on the merits, the right of the stockholder to a standing in equity receives but little attention, and the overburdened courts of the United States have this additional important litigation imposed upon them by a simulated and conventional arrangement, unauthorized by the facts of the case or by the sound principles of equity jurisdiction.\" Id., at 452-453.\n\n\n The Court in Hawes v. Oakland was not concerned at all with control of the corporation by allegedly wrong-doing directors for purposes of aligning the parties. The Court was concerned with imposition on the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary in the general run of stockholders' actions, and more particularly, in the usual situation where the defendants would not be directors at all but third parties having nothing to do with the management of the corporation.\n\nThe Court in Hawes, therefore, announced restriction upon a stockholder attempting to bring \"a suit founded on a right of action existing in the corporation itself, and in which the corporation itself is the appropriate plaintiff.\" Id., at 460. Not only must a complainant show some ultra vires or fraudulent action by the directors but he must also demonstrate that he was a shareholder at the time of the transaction complained of (or acquired shares thereafter by operation of law), that he has made efforts to induce the desired action by the directors and, if necessary, by the stockholders, and that \"the suit is not a collusive one to confer on a court of the United States jurisdiction in a case of which it could otherwise have no cognizance . . . .\" Id., at 461. These rules were codified that Term in Equity Rule 94, see 104 U.S. IX, now Rule 23 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Their history and purpose indicate the character of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 109]\n\u00a0\n requirements laid down by the Court. They do not define the constitutional jurisdiction of the Court; they are the allegations in any event requisite to the Court's proceeding to consider the case. In Hawes itself, the Court, after finding that the stockholder had not complied with the requisites for suit, dismissed the action, not for want of jurisdiction, but for want of equity. The argument that compliance with the rule was a jurisdictional requirement was made and rejected in Venner v. Great Northern R. Co., \n209 \nU.S., at 33\n-34: \"this argument overlooks the purpose and nature of the rule. . . . Neither the rule nor the decision from which it was derived deals with the question of the jurisdiction of the courts, but only prescribes the manner in which the jurisdiction shall be exercised.\"\n\nCompliance with Rule 94 was the issue in Delaware & Hudson Co. v. Albany & S. R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 435\n. In that case, the lower court certified to this Court questions concerning maintenance of a stockholders' suit in the face of failure to allege demand for relief upon the directors and stockholders of the corporation. The Court held that such a demand would have been futile in view of the control of the defendant corporation by the other corporate defendant. It was during the course of its discussion of the futility of making a demand in such a situation that the Court stated what is relied upon by the Court in the present case - that the \"attitude of the directors need not be sinister. It may be sincere.\" Id., at 451. Of course, the Court in that case was quite correct. But it was not concerned with, or adverting to, jurisdictional alignment, any more than it was talking about jurisdictional alignment in Hawes, also now relied upon by the Court. Both cases involved the preliminary requirements for stating a cause of action under the Rules. (For a similar discussion of what stockholders must allege with respect to the attitude of directors, but in a case where there was clearly \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 110]\n\u00a0\n federal question jurisdiction, see Ashwander v. TVA, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 318\n-323, and 341-344.)\n*\n\u00a0\n\nFurther confusion is introduced by the fact that both problems - jurisdictional alignment and compliance with Rule 94 - may be present in the same case. This was true in Doctor v. Harrington, where the Court was not very careful in making explicit separation of the two issues; it was also true of Venner v. Great Northern R. Co., supra, where the Court was very careful to separate the two issues. Such separation of very different concepts is of course essential when one characterizes the attitude of the directors. It is one thing when suit is against a third party to hold that a demand on the directors need not be made if such demand would for any reason be futile, and that sincere opposition by directors would make such a demand futile. It is quite something else to state that, since sincere opposition is sufficient for that purpose, it is also sufficient to demonstrate that the corporation is \"disabled from protecting itself\" and should therefore be aligned as a defendant. That, as we have seen, is factually false and is contrary to what this Court for 52 years has laid down as the controlling rules governing diversity jurisdiction.\n\nOne final matter of general importance should be discussed before applying the general principles adduced to the facts of the present cases. The Court states: \"[T]he proper course is not to try out the issues presented by the charges of wrongdoing but to determine the issue of antagonism on the face of the pleadings and by the nature of the controversy.\" Of course the charges of wrongdoing need not be determined to ascertain the jurisdiction of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 111]\n\u00a0\n the federal courts. What must be determined when directors or other persons alleged to control the corporation are joined as defendants is the relation of these people to the corporation. And while in certain cases the issues may be determined from the face of the pleadings, the courts are not so limited. The Court speaks of making \"a practical not a mechanical determination,\" but a more mechanical determination could hardly be imagined. If anything had been regarded as settled until today about federal jurisdiction, it was that \"It is our duty, as it is that of the lower federal courts, to `look beyond the pleadings and arrange the parties according to their sides in the dispute.' Dawson v. Columbia Trust Co., \n197 \nU.S. 178, 180\n.\" Indianapolis v. Chase National Bank, \n314 \nU.S. 63, 69\n. Of course, this may take time and may not always be easy of determination. I had not thought up to now that such considerations should lead us to disregard our constitutional obligation, for as the District Court in No. 316 stated, \"It is more than costly error therefore - it is an unconstitutional invasion of the jurisdiction of the state courts - for a federal court to sustain federal jurisdiction of a civil action between private persons where `the matter in controversy' exceeds the sum or value of $3,000 . . . but does not arise `under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States,'. . . and diversity of citizenship as to `the matter in controversy' does not exist. U.S. Const. Art. III; 28 U.S.C. 1332. . . .\" 117 F. Supp., at 808.\n\nThe proceedings in each of the present cases have followed different paths. In No. 316, Smith v. Sperling, the District Court held a hearing to determine the presence of the special circumstances that this Court's decisions indicated would require alignment of the corporation as a defendant. It did not find such circumstances and, aligning the corporation as a plaintiff, it dismissed the cause of action for lack of the requisite diversity. 117 \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 112]\n\u00a0\n F. Supp. 781. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed this aspect of the case. 237 F.2d 317. I find no justification for overturning the findings and conclusions of the District Court made after extended hearing and analysis and affirmed by the Court of Appeals. I would therefore affirm.\n\nIn No. 149, Swanson v. Traer, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint on the merits because it did not appear that they had \"laid a foundation sufficient to support a derivative stockholders' suit.\" On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, but on the ground that necessary realignment of the corporation as a plaintiff destroyed diversity and required dismissal of the suit for lack of jurisdiction. 230 F.2d 228. Examining the pleadings, the position taken by the corporation in the litigation, especially the affidavit and statement by counsel for the corporation, the Court of Appeals concluded that \"in their business judgment, both the directors and Mr. Busch [the corporation's counsel] were of the sincere opinion that the filing of such a suit would not be for the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders. The named plaintiffs disagreed. This difference of opinion is not of itself evidence of antagonism on the part of the Railway Company.\" Id., at 237.\n\nThe court stated that the allegation of the complaint that \"several members\" of the corporation's board of directors at the time suit was filed had been a part of the alleged conspiracy was insufficient to allege antagonism by a majority of the board. The court was also impressed by a lengthy, detailed affidavit filed by the corporation's counsel, retained after the transactions complained of, who stated that he had reviewed the transaction pursuant to the direction of the board of directors and had advised against suit. The facts relied on by the Court of Appeals are not without weight in support of its conclusion. The plaintiffs' general allegations, however, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 91, 113]\n\u00a0\n imply hostility on the part of the whole board of directors, and in this state of the record, plaintiffs should have been given an opportunity to substantiate their allegations at a hearing before the District Court, as was the indicated course of proceeding when the matter initially came before the District Court.

UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 49\nArgued: December 5, 1956Decided: January 14, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a resident of the Philippines, sued in the Court of Claims to recover just compensation for the requisitioning by Philippine guerrilla forces of certain equipment and supplies during the Japanese occupation of the Philippine Islands. The suit was filed more than six years after the last alleged requisition. Held: The suit was barred by the six-year statute of limitations.

Pp. 276-277.\n\n\n 133 Ct. Cl. 971, affirmed on other grounds.\n\nPrew Savoy and George W. Foley argued the cause for petitioner. On the brief were Mr. Savoy and Jay Pfotenhauer.\n\nRoger D. Fisher argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Doub, Melvin Richter and William W. Ross.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis suit was filed in the Court of Claims by petitioner, a resident of the Philippines, to recover just compensation for the requisitioning by Philippine guerrilla forces \n\n[352 \nU.S. 270, 271]\n\u00a0\n of certain foodstuffs, supplies, equipment, and merchandise during the Japanese occupation of the Philippine Islands. While decision on the merits would require a determination of the status of Philippine guerrillas as a unit operating in the service of the United States, we do not reach that question. We have determined that the Court of Claims lacks jurisdiction because the claim was not filed within the period provided by the statute, 62 Stat. 976, 28 U.S.C. 2501.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nOn July 26, 1941, pursuant to the Philippine Independence Act,\n2\n President Roosevelt ordered the Philippine Army into the service of the armed forces of the United States.\n3\n After the fall of Bataan and Corregidor in 1942, elements of this Philippine Army fled to the hills \n\n[352 \nU.S. 270, 272]\n\u00a0\n and continued military resistance against the Japanese as guerrilla units. These units, from time to time, requisitioned and commandeered supplies from Philippine civilians. Petitioner contends that these units were part of the United States Army having implied authority to bind the United States to pay for such supplies. He alleges that from September 1942 until the last requisition in January 1945 he delivered supplies to these guerrilla units of the value of $119,765.75. He filed a claim for this amount with the United States Army Claims Service on March 30, 1948. This claim was denied on June 21, 1948.\n\nThereafter on April 26, 1951, more than six years after the last alleged requisition, this action was filed in the United States Court of Claims. The Government moved to dismiss on several grounds, including (1) that the statutory limitation period had run, and (2) that the units were part of the Philippine forces for which the United States was in no manner responsible. In a per curiam order, 133 Ct. Cl. 971, after issue was drawn on the pleadings, the Court of Claims dismissed the suit on the authority of Logronio v. United States, 132 Ct. Cl. 596, 133 F. Supp. 395 (1955). In effect, this reaffirmed its earlier holdings that members of the guerrilla units of the Philippine Army were not part of the Army of the United States.\n4\n The limitation question was not passed upon.\n\nWe granted certiorari, \n351 \nU.S. 917\n, to determine the validity of the claims of the petitioner and others in like position. After issuance of the writ in this case, the Court of Claims in Compania Maritima v. United States, 136 Ct. Cl. ___, 145 F. Supp. 935 (1956), held that a Philippine resident seeking redress against the United States was under a legal disability while hostilities \n\n[352 \nU.S. 270, 273]\n\u00a0\n between Japan and the United States continued. The court further held that the claim of such a person must be filed within three years \"after the disability ceases,\" i. e., by September 2, 1948. Apprehensive that this rule might be applied to his case, petitioner requested and we granted permission to argue the limitation question which, as we have said, had been raised but not considered at the time of the dismissal by the Court of Claims.\n\nPetitioner urges that his suit was timely filed because he was first required to present his claim to the Army Claims Service before he could prosecute the action in the Court of Claims. This administrative procedure, he points out, was not exhausted until June 21, 1948, and this suit was filed on April 26, 1951, less than three years thereafter. But, if he should fail with this contention, he argues that the war suspended the running of the statute and it was, therefore, tolled until September 2, 1945, when hostilities ceased with Japan. We cannot agree with either contention.\n\nIt has been settled since Kendall v. United States, \n107 \nU.S. 123\n (1883), that the Congress in creating the Court of Claims restricted that court's jurisdiction. In Kendall this Court held that the Congress in the Act creating the Court of Claims gave the Government's consent to be sued therein only in certain classes of claims and that no others might be asserted against it, including \"claims which are declared barred if not asserted within the time limited by the statute.\" Id., at 125. As to the latter cases, jurisdiction was given only over those filed \"within six years after such claim first accrues,\" unless the claimant was \"under legal disability or beyond the seas at the time the claim accrues,\" in which event suit must \"be filed within three years after the disability ceases.\" 62 Stat. 976, 28 U.S.C. 2501. As was said in Kendall, supra, \"The court cannot superadd to those enumerated . . .,\" it having \"no more authority to engraft [another] disability \n\n[352 \nU.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n upon the statute than a disability arising from sickness, surprise, or inevitable accident, which might prevent a claimant from suing within the time prescribed.\" Id., at 125.\n\nPetitioner asserts that his action did not accrue until the denial of the claim by the Army Claims Service. At the same time, he admits that the claim filed there was based on the alleged delivery of supplies, etc., on the promise of future payment. The claim, if allowed, was against the Philippine Government, not the United States.\n5\n The claim asserted in this proceeding, on the contrary, is against the United States and based on the alleged taking of property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Petitioner would have us hold that this just compensation case could not be filed until after an administrative denial of his claim filed with the Army Claims Service. But, even if the claims were laid on the same theory and each was directed against the United States, Congress has made no such requirement. It has not so restricted the jurisdiction of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 270, 275]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Claims.\n6\n Under the circumstances, for us to say that the exhaustion of administrative remedies in such case is a prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims would but \"engraft [another] disability upon the statute\" and thus frustrate the purpose of Congress. Furthermore, it would be a limitless extension of the period of limitation that Congress expressly provided for the prosecution of claims against the Government in the Court of Claims. This we cannot do.\n\nWe now reach petitioner's second contention. The cause of action as alleged by petitioner was for just compensation for supplies, etc., taken from him by guerrillas during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. He alleges in his complaint that the action, if any he has, accrued at the time of the taking and could only be maintained within six years thereafter but for the existence of the hostilities which he claims tolled the statute. He depends on Hanger v. Abbott, 6 Wall. 532 (1868), to support this position. Such reliance is misplaced. That case involved private citizens, not the Government. It has no applicability to claims against the sovereign. See Haycraft v. United States, 22 Wall. 81 (1875).\n\nTo permit the application of the doctrine urged by petitioner would impose the tolling of the statute in every time-limit-consent Act passed by the Congress. For example, statutes permitting suits for tax refunds, tort actions, alien property litigation, patent cases, and other claims against the Government would all be affected. Strangely enough, Congress would be required to provide expressly in each statute that the period of limitation was \n\n[352 \nU.S. 270, 276]\n\u00a0\n not to be extended by war. But Congress was entitled to assume that the limitation period it prescribed meant just that period and no more. With this intent in mind, Congress has passed specific legislation each time it has seen fit to toll such statutes of limitations because of war.\n7\n And this Court has long decided that limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied. United States v. Sherwood, \n312 \nU.S. 584, 590\n-591 (1941), and cases there cited. Furthermore, even if hostilities prevented petitioner from filing his claim and this condition could be regarded as creating a \"disability,\" the claim would nonetheless be barred by the express terms of this statute because not filed within three years after the cessation of hostilities, to wit, before September 2, 1948. Likewise, if petitioner claimed such a disability under the Trading with the Enemy Act,\n8\n he would not better his position, for timely action was necessary by the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 270, 277]\n\u00a0\n same date. The same is true of any claim under the disability specifically provided for \"persons beyond the seas,\"\n9\n even if this provision were applicable to petitioner. Such applicability has not been urged and we do not pass upon it.\n\nWe are not unmindful that the enforcement of this rule might result in hardship in some cases, and perhaps frustrate the expectations of some Philippine citizens who in good faith supplied recognized guerrilla units. Such considerations are not for us, as this Court can enforce relief against the sovereign only within the limits established by Congress. Petitioner here had six years within which to act. He filed no claim whatever until after the expiration of three years from the date he alleges the last taking occurred. This claim was filed with the Army Claims Service on the basis of an alleged contract. That claim was denied within less than three months after it was filed. This left petitioner over two and a half years additional time to pursue his just compensation remedy. Still he did nothing for almost three years, when he filed this suit in the Court of Claims. By that time his claim, on any theory, was barred by statute. The judgment is therefore.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 62 Stat. 976, 28 U.S.C. 2501, the pertinent part of which reads:\n\n\"Every claim of which the Court of Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed, or the claim is referred by the Senate or House of Representatives, or by the head of an executive department within six years after such claim first accrues.\n\n.  .   .  .   .\n\n\n\n\"A petition on the claim of a person under legal disability or beyond the seas at the time the claim accrues may be filed within three years after the disability ceases.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Philippine Independence Act of March 24, 1934, 48 Stat. 456 et seq., provides in pertinent part:\n\n\"(12) The Philippine Islands recognizes the right of the United States to expropriate property for public uses, to maintain military and other reservations and armed forces in the Philippines, and, upon order of the President, to call into the service of such armed forces all military forces organized by the Philippine government.\" Id., at 457.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Military Order of President Roosevelt, dated July 26, 1941, 6 Fed.

United States, 91 F. Supp. 748 (1950), vacated, 122 Ct. Cl. 708, 106 F. Supp. 182 (1952); Logronio v. United States, 132 Ct. Cl. 596, 133 F. Supp. 395 (1955), overruling the second Victorio opinion, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] On August 6, 1945, the functions of the Army Claims Service, which had been established in April 1945, were extended to include consideration of certain types of guerrilla claims, such as claims of civilians for compensation for supplies delivered to the guerrillas during the Japanese occupation, provided \"there was a clear understanding at the time the supplies and equipment or services were purchased or contracted for that payment would eventually be made.\" See the order of General MacArthur to the Commanding General, U.S. Armed Forces, Western Pacific, dated August 6, 1945. Such claims were actually asserted against the Philippine Government and, if and when approved by the Claims Service, were paid by that Government. In 1946, Congress advanced $200,000,000 for the expenses of the Army of the Philippines, 60 Stat. 14, and at various other times during the war similar special appropriations were made. From such appropriations the Philippine Government paid whatever claims were found valid. For further discussion of the operation of the Army Claims Service in the Philippines, see Victorio v. United States, 91 F. Supp. 748 (1950).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] While the Court of Claims held in Dino v. United States, 119 Ct. Cl. 307 (1951), that a claim similar to the one here involved should first be asserted in the appropriate administrative agency, this rule has now been abandoned by that court. See, e. g., the discussion in Tan v. United States, 122 Ct. Cl. 662, 102 F. Supp. 552 (1952), and the cases there cited.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Congress specifically tolled the statute of limitations for some actions against the Government during the Second World War, e. g., Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, 54 Stat. 1181, 50 U.S.C. App. 525, providing for suspension of limitations in suits by or against servicemen; and 34 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 60 Stat. 925-926, 50 U.S.C. App. 34 (a), suspending limitations in suits against the Alien Property Custodian respecting vested property. However, the statute of limitations has not been enlarged by Congress for claims such as petitioner's.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] 40 Stat. 411, 50 U.S.C. App. 2:\n\n\"That the word `enemy,' as used herein, shall be deemed to mean, for the purposes of such trading and of this Act -\n\n\n\"(a) Any individual, partnership, or other body of individuals, of any nationality, resident within the territory (including that occupied by the military and naval forces) of any nation with which the United States is at war, or resident outside the United States and doing business within such territory, and any corporation incorporated within such territory of any nation with which the United States is at war or incorporated within any country other than the United States and doing business within such territory.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The present saving clause (see note 1, supra) was enacted in 1948. However, the pre-1948 statute, 36 Stat. 1139, 28 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 262, also had a saving clause which contained as a specific disability \"persons beyond the seas at the time the claim accrued.\" The 1948 amendment merely substituted the general saving clause for the prior clause which specifically set forth various disabilities.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER concur, dissenting.\n\nIf petitioner had sued in the Court of Claims without first presenting his claim to the Army Claims Service, I \n\n[352 \nU.S. 270, 278]\n\u00a0\n think the Court of Claims would have been warranted in dismissing it. The Army Claims Service was established April 7, 1945, by General Douglas MacArthur to process claims such as this one. The Army Claims Service questioned whether expenses incurred by guerrilla organizations could be paid out of the appropriated funds. On August 6, 1945, General MacArthur advised the Army Claims Service that it could authorize the payment of claims such as this one. That directive stated:\n\n \". . . The United States Army will assume the responsibility for paying certain claims arising out of activities of guerrilla forces in the Philippines. That responsibility will be limited to claims for the value of goods or services essential for carrying on operations against the enemy.\n\n\n \". . . No payments will be made on claims arising out of activities of other than recognized guerrilla forces.\n\n\n .   .   .   .   .\n\n\n \". . . Such claims will be paid from the appropriation, `Expenses, Army of the Philippines'.\n\n\n \". . . Payment will be made only on claims where there was a clear understanding at the time the supplies and equipment or services were purchased or contracted for that payment would eventually be made. There must have been a clear intention on the part of the guerrilla commander and of the vendor or employee that an obligation was being created. It must be definitely shown that the provision of such supplies, equipment or services was not intended as a patriotic donation to the common cause against the enemy. It must also be definitely shown that the supplies, equipment or services were essential for the operation of the guerrilla forces.\" \n\n[352 \nU.S. 270, 279]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n That directive was issued in accordance with the Act of July 3, 1945, 59 Stat. 401-402, which appropriated money for \"all expenses necessary for the mobilization, operation, and maintenance of the Army of the Philippines.\" The expenditure and accounting were to be in the manner prescribed by the President. Id., at 402. And the moneys were to be available to the Philippine Government \"as authorized by the Commanding General, United States Army Forces in the Far East.\" Id., at 402. The Government's brief advises us that nearly $300,000,000 was appropriated by the Congress for that purpose through July 3, 1945. And on February 18, 1946, $200,000,000 more was added to that appropriation. 60 Stat. 14.\n\nThe statutory scheme for payment of the expenses of the guerrilla forces, therefore, demonstrates that this claim, if it can be sustained on the merits, runs against the United States. The fact that approved claims were paid by the Philippine Government is a mere administrative detail. For it acted in this respect only as a disbursing agency for the United States.\n\nHence petitioner properly first presented his claim to the Army Claims Service, which rejected it June 21, 1948. The six-year statute should be held to run from that date. For it is the general rule that, where a claim must first be processed by an administrative agency, it does not accrue until the agency refuses payment. See United States v. Taylor, \n104 \nU.S. 216, 222\n. Cf. United States v. Clark, \n96 \nU.S. 37, 43\n-44.\n\nThat was the view of the Court of Claims in an earlier case involving such a problem. See Dino v. United States, 119 Ct. Cl. 307. I think the Court of Claims position in the Dino case is the correct one. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 270, 280]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF WISCONSIN v.

The complaint alleged a conspiracy to defraud the Illinois corporation through sales to it of certain properties in which some of the directors were personally interested. It also averred a demand on the directors to bring suit, their refusal to do so, and the futility of making any demand on the stockholders. The Court of Appeals concluded that there was no such hostility to the plaintiffs as to make the Illinois corporation \"antagonistic\" to its stockholders, and it realigned that corporation as a party plaintiff and affirmed dismissal of the suit, on the ground that there was no diversity jurisdiction. Held: The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Pp. 115-117.\n\n (a) The management is definitely and distinctly opposed to the institution of this litigation; it is, therefore, \"antagonistic\" to the stockholders; and the corporation was properly made a defendant.

Frank Reavis for the National City Lines, Inc., et al., respondents.\n\nFrancis X. Busch and James J. Magner filed a brief for the Chicago North Shore & Milwaukee Railway, respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case, a companion case to No. 316, Smith v. Sperling, ante, p. 91, presents another aspect of the problem of realignment of parties in a stockholders' derivative suit that is brought in a Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. Plaintiff-stockholders are citizens of Nevada and stockholders in the Chicago North Shore & Milwaukee Ry. Co., an Illinois corporation. It was made a defendant along with individuals, who are citizens of Illinois, a Delaware corporation, and an Indiana corporation. The complaint charged a conspiracy to defraud the Railway Co. The alleged fraud consisted of a series of sales of transit properties to the Railway Co., properties in which it is charged some of the directors were personally interested. The complaint averred a demand on the directors to bring suit, a refusal on their part, and the futility of making any demand on the stockholders.\n\nAnswers were filed and motions made to dismiss. The District Court dismissed the bill on the ground that no showing had been made that the refusal of the management to act to redress the alleged wrong was not a decision entrusted to the good-faith judgment of the directors. In other words, the District Court concluded that the controversy did not fall within the exceptional group of cases where the stockholder may dispute the management and take the reins of corporate litigation in his own hands. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 114, 116]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals did not reach that question. Though it appeared from the record that the directors were opposed to the bringing of the suit, the Court of Appeals concluded that there was no such hostility to the plaintiffs as to make it \"antagonistic\" within the meaning of the cases. It accordingly realigned the corporation as a party plaintiff. Since there were then Illinois citizens on each side of the litigation, the requisite diversity was not present and the orders dismissing the bill were affirmed. 230 F.2d 228. The case is here on a writ of certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 865\n.\n\nFor the reasons stated in Smith v. Sperling, supra, we think this case is an instance where the management - for good reasons or for bad - is definitely and distinctly opposed to the institution of this litigation. The management is, therefore, antagonistic to the stockholders as that conception has been used in the cases. It follows that the corporation was properly made a defendant.\n\nThere remains for consideration the question ruled on by the District Court and which the Court of Appeals did not reach, viz. whether this suit is of that exceptional character which stockholders may bring.\n\nAs we stated in Smith v. Sperling, ante, p. 91, since our decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, the question whether in these diversity suits a stockholder may sue on behalf of his corporation is governed by local law. See Cohen v.

He did not plead his privilege against self-incrimination, but based his refusal to answer such questions on the grounds that they were not pertinent to the inquiry and violated his rights under the First Amendment. Persisting in his refusal when haled into a State Court and directed to answer, he was adjudged guilty of contempt. This judgment was affirmed by the State Supreme Court, which construed the term \"subversive persons\" broadly enough to include persons engaged in conduct only remotely related to actual subversion and done completely apart from any conscious intent to be a part of such activity. It also held that the need of the Legislature to be informed on the subject of self-preservation of government outweighed the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred in the process. Held: On the record in this case, appellant's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated, and the judgment is reversed. Pp. 235-267.\n\n 100 N.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join.\n\nThis case, like Watkins v. United States, ante, p. 178, brings before us a question concerning the constitutional limits of legislative inquiry. The investigation here was conducted under the aegis of a state legislature, rather than a House of Congress. This places the controversy in a slightly different setting from that in Watkins. The ultimate question here is whether the investigation deprived Sweezy of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. For the reasons to be set out in this opinion, we conclude that the record in this case does not sustain the power of the State to compel the disclosures that the witness refused to make.\n\nThis case was brought here as an appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2). Jurisdiction was alleged to rest upon contentions, rejected by the state courts, that a statute \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 236]\n\u00a0\n of New Hampshire is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. We postponed a decision on the question of jurisdiction until consideration of the merits. \n352 \nU.S. 812\n. The parties neither briefed nor argued the jurisdictional question. The appellant has thus failed to meet his burden of showing that jurisdiction by appeal was properly invoked. The appeal is therefore dismissed. Treating the appeal papers as a petition for writ of certiorari, under 28 U.S.C. 2103, the petition is granted. Cf. Union National Bank v. Lamb, \n337 \nU.S. 38, 39\n-40.\n\nThe investigation in which petitioner was summoned to testify had its origins in a statute passed by the New Hampshire legislature in 1951.\n1\n It was a comprehensive scheme of regulation of subversive activities. There was a section defining criminal conduct in the nature of sedition. \"Subversive organizations\" were declared unlawful and ordered dissolved. \"Subversive persons\" were made ineligible for employment by the state government. Included in the disability were those employed as teachers or in other capacities by any public educational institution. A loyalty program was instituted to eliminate \"subversive persons\" among government personnel. All present employees, as well as candidates for elective office in the future, were required to make sworn statements that they were not \"subversive persons.\"\n\nIn 1953, the legislature adopted a \"Joint Resolution Relating to the Investigation of Subversive Activities.\"\n2\n It was resolved:\n\n \"That the attorney general is hereby authorized and directed to make full and complete investigation with respect to violations of the subversive activities act of 1951 and to determine whether subversive \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 237]\n\u00a0\n persons as defined in said act are presently located within this state. The attorney general is authorized to act upon his own motion and upon such information as in his judgment may be reasonable or reliable. . . .\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"The attorney general is directed to proceed with criminal prosecutions under the subversive activities act whenever evidence presented to him in the course of the investigation indicates violations thereof, and he shall report to the 1955 session on the first day of its regular session the results of this investigation, together with his recommendations, if any, for necessary legislation.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n Under state law, this was construed to constitute the Attorney General as a one-man legislative committee.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 238]\n\u00a0\n He was given the authority to delegate any part of the investigation to any member of his staff. The legislature conferred upon the Attorney General the further authority to subpoena witnesses or documents. He did not have power to hold witnesses in contempt, however. In the event that coercive or punitive sanctions were needed, the Attorney General could invoke the aid of a State Superior Court which could find recalcitrant witnesses in contempt of court.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner was summoned to appear before the Attorney General on two separate occasions. On January 5, 1954, petitioner testified at length upon his past conduct and associations. He denied that he had ever been a member of the Communist Party or that he had ever been part of any program to overthrow the government by force or violence. The interrogation ranged over many matters, from petitioner's World War II military service with the Office of Strategic Services to his sponsorship, in 1949, of the Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace, at which he spoke.\n\nDuring the course of the inquiry, petitioner declined to answer several questions. His reasons for doing so were given in a statement he read to the Committee at \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 239]\n\u00a0\n the outset of the hearing.\n6\n He declared he would not answer those questions which were not pertinent to the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 240]\n\u00a0\n subject under inquiry as well as those which transgress the limitations of the First Amendment. In keeping with \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 241]\n\u00a0\n this stand, he refused to disclose his knowledge of the Progressive Party in New Hampshire or of persons with \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 242]\n\u00a0\n whom he was acquainted in that organization.\n7\n No action was taken by the Attorney General to compel answers to these questions.\n\nThe Attorney General again summoned petitioner to testify on June 3, 1954. There was more interrogation about the witness' prior contacts with Communists. The Attorney General lays great stress upon an article which petitioner had co-authored. It deplored the use of violence by the United States and other capitalist countries in attempting to preserve a social order which the writers thought must inevitably fall. This resistance, the article \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 243]\n\u00a0\n continued, will be met by violence from the oncoming socialism, violence which is to be less condemned morally than that of capitalism since its purpose is to create a \"truly human society.\" Petitioner affirmed that he styled himself a \"classical Marxist\" and a \"socialist\" and that the article expressed his continuing opinion.\n\nAgain, at the second hearing, the Attorney General asked, and petitioner refused to answer, questions concerning the Progressive Party, and its predecessor, the Progressive Citizens of America. Those were:\n\n \"Was she, Nancy Sweezy, your wife, active in the formation of the Progressive Citizens of America?\"\n\n\n \"Was Nancy Sweezy then working with individuals who were then members of the Communist Party?\"\n\n\n \"Was Charles Beebe active in forming the Progressive Citizens of America?\"\n\n\n \"Was Charles Beebe active in the Progressive Party in New Hampshire?\"\n\n\n \"Did he work with your present wife - Did Charles Beebe work with your present wife in 1947?\"\n\n\n \"Did it [a meeting at the home of Abraham Walenko in Weare during 1948] have anything to do with the Progressive Party?\"\n\n\n The Attorney General also turned to a subject which had not yet occurred at the time of the first hearing. On March 22, 1954, petitioner had delivered a lecture to a class of 100 students in the humanities course at the University of New Hampshire. This talk was given at the invitation of the faculty teaching that course. Petitioner had addressed the class upon such invitations in the two preceding years as well. He declined to answer the following questions:\n\n \"What was the subject of your lecture?\"\n\n\n \"Didn't you tell the class at the University of New Hampshire on Monday, March 22, 1954, that Socialism was inevitable in this country?\" \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 244]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"Did you advocate Marxism at that time?\"\n\n\n \"Did you express the opinion, or did you make the statement at that time that Socialism was inevitable in America?\"\n\n\n \"Did you in this last lecture on March 22 or in any of the former lectures espouse the theory of dialectical materialism?\"\n\n\n Distinct from the categories of questions about the Progressive Party and the lectures was one question about petitioner's opinions. He was asked: \"Do you believe in Communism?\" He had already testified that he had never been a member of the Communist Party, but he refused to answer this or any other question concerning opinion or belief.\n\nPetitioner adhered in this second proceeding to the same reasons for not answering he had given in his statement at the first hearing. He maintained that the questions were not pertinent to the matter under inquiry and that they infringed upon an area protected under the First Amendment.\n\nFollowing the hearings, the Attorney General petitioned the Superior Court of Merrimack County, New Hampshire, setting forth the circumstances of petitioner's appearance before the Committee and his refusal to answer certain questions.\n8\n The petition prayed that the court propound the questions to the witness. After hearing argument, the court ruled that the questions set out above were pertinent.\n9\n Petitioner was called as a witness by the court and persisted in his refusal to answer for constitutional reasons. The court adjudged him in contempt \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 245]\n\u00a0\n and ordered him committed to the county jail until purged of the contempt.\n\nThe New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed. 100 N. H. 103, 121 A. 2d 783. Its opinion discusses only two classes of questions addressed to the witness: those dealing with the lectures and those about the Progressive Party and the Progressive Citizens of America. No mention is made of the single question concerning petitioner's belief in Communism. In view of what we hold to be the controlling issue of the case, however, it is unnecessary to resolve affirmatively that that particular question was or was not included in the decision by the State Supreme Court.\n\nThere is no doubt that legislative investigations, whether on a federal or state level, are capable of encroaching upon the constitutional liberties of individuals. It is particularly important that the exercise of the power of compulsory process be carefully circumscribed when the investigative process tends to impinge upon such highly sensitive areas as freedom of speech or press, freedom of political association, and freedom of communication of ideas, particularly in the academic community. Responsibility for the proper conduct of investigations rests, of course, upon the legislature itself. If that assembly chooses to authorize inquiries on its behalf by a legislatively created committee, that basic responsibility carries forward to include the duty of adequate supervision of the actions of the committee. This safeguard can be nullified when a committee is invested with a broad and ill-defined jurisdiction. The authorizing resolution thus becomes especially significant in that it reveals the amount of discretion that has been conferred upon the committee.\n\nIn this case, the investigation is governed by provisions in the New Hampshire Subversive Activities Act of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 246]\n\u00a0\n 1951.\n10\n The Attorney General was instructed by the legislature to look into violations of that Act. In addition, he was given the far more sweeping mandate to find out if there were subversive persons, as defined in that Act, present in New Hampshire. That statute, therefore, measures the breadth and scope of the investigation before us.\n\n\"Subversive persons\" are defined in many gradations of conduct. Our interest is in the minimal requirements of that definition since they will outline its reach. According to the statute, a person is a \"subversive person\" if he, by any means, aids in the commission of any act intended to assist in the alteration of the constitutional form of government by force or violence.\n11\n The possible remoteness from armed insurrection of conduct that could satisfy these criteria is obvious from the language. The statute goes well beyond those who are engaged in efforts designed to alter the form of government by force or violence. The statute declares, in effect, that the assistant of an assistant is caught up in the definition. This chain of conduct attains increased significance in light of the lack of a necessary element of guilty knowledge in either stage of assistants. The State Supreme Court has held that the definition encompasses persons engaged in the specified conduct \". . . whether or not done `knowingly and willfully . . . .'\" Nelson v. Wyman, 99 N. H. 33, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 247]\n\u00a0\n 39, 105 A. 2d 756, 763. The potential sweep of this definition extends to conduct which is only remotely related to actual subversion and which is done completely free of any conscious intent to be a part of such activity.\n\n\n The statute's definition of \"subversive organizations\" is also broad. An association is said to be any group of persons, whether temporarily or permanently associated together, for joint action or advancement of views on any subject.\n12\n An organization is deemed subversive if it has a purpose to abet, advise or teach activities intended to assist in the alteration of the constitutional form of government by force or violence.\n\nThe situation before us is in many respects analogous to that in Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n. The Court held there that a loyalty oath prescribed by the State of Oklahoma for all its officers and employees violated the requirements of the Due Process Clause because it entailed sanctions for membership in subversive organizations without scienter. A State cannot, in attempting to bar disloyal individuals from its employ, exclude persons solely on the basis of organizational membership, regardless of their knowledge concerning the organizations to which they belonged. The Court said:\n\n \"There can be no dispute about the consequences visited upon a person excluded from public employment \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 248]\n\u00a0\n on disloyalty grounds. In the view of the community, the stain is a deep one; indeed, it has become a badge of infamy. Especially is this so in time of cold war and hot emotions when `each man begins to eye his neighbor as a possible enemy.' Yet under the Oklahoma Act, the fact of association alone determines disloyalty and disqualification; it matters not whether association existed innocently or knowingly. To thus inhibit individual freedom of movement is to stifle the flow of democratic expression and controversy at one of its chief sources.\" \n344 \nU.S., at 190\n-191.\n\n\n The sanction emanating from legislative investigations is of a different kind than loss of employment. But the stain of the stamp of disloyalty is just as deep. The inhibiting effect in the flow of democratic expression and controversy upon those directly affected and those touched more subtly is equally grave. Yet here, as in Wieman, the program for the rooting out of subversion is drawn without regard to the presence or absence of guilty knowledge in those affected.\n\nThe nature of the investigation which the Attorney General was authorized to conduct is revealed by this case. He delved minutely into the past conduct of petitioner, thereby making his private life a matter of public record. The questioning indicates that the investigators had thoroughly prepared for the interview and were not acquiring new information as much as corroborating data already in their possession. On the great majority of questions, the witness was cooperative, even though he made clear his opinion that the interrogation was unjustified and unconstitutional. Two subjects arose upon which petitioner refused to answer: his lectures at the University of New Hampshire, and his knowledge of the Progressive Party and its adherents. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 249]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe state courts upheld the attempt to investigate the academic subject on the ground that it might indicate whether petitioner was a \"subversive person.\" What he taught the class at a state university was found relevant to the character of the teacher. The State Supreme Court carefully excluded the possibility that the inquiry was sustainable because of the state interest in the state university. There was no warrant in the authorizing resolution for that. 100 N. H., at 110, 121 A. 2d, at 789-790. The sole basis for the inquiry was to scrutinize the teacher as a person, and the inquiry must stand or fall on that basis.\n\nThe interrogation on the subject of the Progressive Party was deemed to come within the Attorney General's mandate because that party might have been shown to be a \"subversive organization.\" The State Supreme Court held that the \". . . questions called for answers concerning the membership or participation of named persons in the Progressive Party which, if given, would aid the Attorney General in determining whether that party and its predecessor are or were subversive organizations.\" 100 N. H., at 112, 121 A. 2d, at 791.\n\nThe New Hampshire court concluded that the \". . . right to lecture and the right to associate with others for a common purpose, be it political or otherwise, are individual liberties guaranteed to every citizen by the State and Federal Constitutions but are not absolute rights. . . . The inquiries authorized by the Legislature in connection with this investigation concerning the contents of the lecture and the membership, purposes and activities of the Progressive Party undoubtedly interfered with the defendant's free exercise of those liberties.\" 100 N. H., at 113, 121 A. 2d, at 791-792.\n\nThe State Supreme Court thus conceded without extended discussion that petitioner's right to lecture and his right to associate with others were constitutionally \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 250]\n\u00a0\n protected freedoms which had been abridged through this investigation. These conclusions could not be seriously debated. Merely to summon a witness and compel him, against his will, to disclose the nature of his past expressions and associations is a measure of governmental interference in these matters. These are rights which are safeguarded by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment. We believe that there unquestionably was an invasion of petitioner's liberties in the areas of academic freedom and political expression - areas in which government should be extremely reticent to tread.\n\nThe essentiality of freedom in the community of American universities is almost self-evident. No one should underestimate the vital role in a democracy that is played by those who guide and train our youth. To impose any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our colleges and universities would imperil the future of our Nation. No field of education is so thoroughly comprehended by man that new discoveries cannot yet be made. Particularly is that true in the social sciences, where few, if any, principles are accepted as absolutes. Scholarship cannot flourish in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust. Teachers and students must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding; otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die.\n\nEqually manifest as a fundamental principle of a democratic society is political freedom of the individual. Our form of government is built on the premise that every citizen shall have the right to engage in political expression and association. This right was enshrined in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. Exercise of these basic freedoms in America has traditionally been through the media of political associations. Any interference with the freedom of a party is simultaneously an interference with the freedom of its adherents. All political \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 251]\n\u00a0\n ideas cannot and should not be channeled into the programs of our two major parties. History has amply proved the virtue of political activity by minority, dissident groups, who innumerable times have been in the vanguard of democratic thought and whose programs were ultimately accepted. Mere unorthodoxy or dissent from the prevailing mores is not to be condemned. The absence of such voices would be a symptom of grave illness in our society.\n\nNotwithstanding the undeniable importance of freedom in the areas, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire did not consider that the abridgment of petitioner's rights under the Constitution vitiated the investigation. In the view of that court, \"the answer lies in a determination of whether the object of the legislative investigation under consideration is such as to justify the restriction thereby imposed upon the defendant's liberties.\" 100 N. H., at 113-114, 121 A. 2d, at 791-792. It found such justification in the legislature's judgment, expressed by its authorizing resolution, that there exists a potential menace from those who would overthrow the government by force and violence. That court concluded that the need for the legislature to be informed on so elemental a subject as the self-preservation of government outweighed the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred in the process.\n\nWe do not now conceive of any circumstance wherein a state interest would justify infringement of rights in these fields. But we do not need to reach such fundamental questions of state power to decide this case. The State Supreme Court itself recognized that there was a weakness in its conclusion that the menace of forcible overthrow of the government justified sacrificing constitutional rights. There was a missing link in the chain of reasoning. The syllogism was not complete. There was nothing to connect the questioning of petitioner with this fundamental interest of the State. Petitioner had been \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 252]\n\u00a0\n interrogated by a one-man legislative committee, not by the legislature itself. The relationship of the committee to the full assembly is vital, therefore, as revealing the relationship of the questioning to the state interest.\n\nIn light of this, the state court emphasized a factor in the authorizing resolution which confined the inquiries which the Attorney General might undertake to the object of the investigation. That limitation was thought to stem from the authorizing resolution's condition precedent to the institution of any inquiry. The New Hampshire legislature specified that the Attorney General should act only when he had information which \". . . in his judgment may be reasonable or reliable.\" The state court construed this to mean that the Attorney General must have something like probable cause for conducting a particular investigation. It is not likely that this device would prove an adequate safeguard against unwarranted inquiries. The legislature has specified that the determination of the necessity for inquiry shall be left in the judgment of the investigator. In this case, the record does not reveal what reasonable or reliable information led the Attorney General to question petitioner. The state court relied upon the Attorney General's description of prior information that had come into his possession.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe respective roles of the legislature and the investigator thus revealed are of considerable significance to the issue before us. It is eminently clear that the basic discretion of determining the direction of the legislative inquiry has been turned over to the investigative agency. The Attorney General has been given such a sweeping and uncertain mandate that it is his decision which picks out the subjects that will be pursued, what witnesses will be summoned and what questions will be asked. In this circumstance, it cannot be stated authoritatively that the legislature asked the Attorney General to gather the kind of facts comprised in the subjects upon which petitioner was interrogated.\n\nInstead of making known the nature of the data it desired, the legislature has insulated itself from those witnesses whose rights may be vitally affected by the investigation. Incorporating by reference provisions from its subversive activities act, it has told the Attorney General, in effect to screen the citizenry of New Hampshire to bring to light anyone who fits into the expansive definitions.\n\nWithin the very broad area thus committed to the discretion of the Attorney General there may be many facts \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 254]\n\u00a0\n which the legislature might find useful. There would also be a great deal of data which that assembly would not want or need. In the classes of information that the legislature might deem it desirable to have, there will be some which it could not validly acquire because of the effect upon the constitutional rights of individual citizens. Separating the wheat from the chaff, from the standpoint of the legislature's object, is the legislature's responsibility because it alone can make that judgment. In this case, the New Hampshire legislature has delegated that task to the Attorney General.\n\nAs a result, neither we nor the state courts have any assurance that the questions petitioner refused to answer fall into a category of matters upon which the legislature wanted to be informed when it initiated this inquiry. The judiciary are thus placed in an untenable position. Lacking even the elementary fact that the legislature wants certain questions answered and recognizing that petitioner's constitutional rights are in jeopardy, we are asked to approve or disapprove his incarceration for contempt.\n\nIn our view, the answer is clear. No one would deny that the infringement of constitutional rights of individuals would violate the guarantee of due process where no state interest underlies the state action. Thus, if the Attorney General's interrogation of petitioner were in fact wholly unrelated to the object of the legislature in authorizing the inquiry, the Due Process Clause would preclude the endangering of constitutional liberties. We believe that an equivalent situation is presented in this case. The lack of any indications that the legislature wanted the information the Attorney General attempted to elicit from petitioner must be treated as the absence of authority. It follows that the use of the contempt power, notwithstanding the interference with constitutional rights, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 255]\n\u00a0\n was not in accordance with the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe conclusion that we have reached in this case is not grounded upon the doctrine of separation of powers. In the Federal Government, it is clear that the Constitution has conferred the powers of government upon three major branches: the Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial. No contention has been made by petitioner that the New Hampshire legislature, by this investigation, arrogated to itself executive or judicial powers. We accept the finding of the State Supreme Court that the employment of the Attorney General as the investigating committee does not alter the legislative nature of the proceedings. Moreover, this Court has held that the concept of separation of powers embodied in the United States Constitution is not mandatory in state governments. Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71\n; but cf. Tenney v. Brandhove, \n341 \nU.S. 367, 378\n. Our conclusion does rest upon a separation of the power of a state legislature to conduct investigations from the responsibility to direct the use of that power insofar as that separation causes a deprivation of the constitutional rights of individuals and a denial of due process of law.\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire is\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] N.

The principal duties of the Attorney General are set forth in N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann., 1955, c. 7, 6-11. He represents the State in all cases before the State Supreme Court. He prosecutes all criminal cases in which the accused is charged with an offense punishable by twenty-five years in prison or more. All other criminal cases are under his general supervision. He gives opinions on questions of law to the legislature, or to state boards, departments, commissions, officers, etc., on questions relating to their official duties.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \"Whenever any official or board is given the power to summon witnesses and take testimony, but has not the power to punish for contempt, and any witness refuses to obey such summons, either as to his appearance or as to the production of things specified in the summons, or refuses to testify or to answer any question, a petition for an order to compel him to testify or his compliance with the summons may be filed in the superior court, or with some justice thereof.\" N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann., 1955, c. 491, 19. \"Upon such petition the court or justice shall have authority to proceed in the matter as though the original proceeding had been in the court, and may make orders and impose penalties accordingly.\" Id., 20. See State v. Uphaus, 100 N. H. 1, 116 A. 2d 887.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] \"Those called to testify before this and other similar investigations can be classified in three categories. \"First there are Communists and those who have reason to believe that even if they are not Communists they have been accused of being and are in danger of harassment and prosecution. \"Second, there are those who approve of the purposes and methods of these investigations. \"Third, there are those who are not Communists and do not believe they are in danger of being prosecuted, but who yet deeply disapprove of the purposes and methods of these investigations. \"The first group will naturally, and I think wholly justifiably, plead the constitutional privilege of not being witnesses against themselves. \"The second group will equally naturally be cooperative witnesses. \"The third group is faced with an extremely difficult dilemma. I know because I belong to this third group, and I have been struggling with its problems for many weeks now. I would like to explain what the nature of that dilemma is. I think it is important that both those conducting these inquiries and the public should understand. \"It is often said: If a person is not a Communist and has nothing to fear, why should he not answer whatever questions are put to him and be done with it? The answer, of course, is that some of us believe these investigations are evil and dangerous, and we do not want to give our approval to them, either tacitly or otherwise. On the contrary, we want to oppose them to the best of our ability and persuade others to do likewise, with the hope of eventually abolishing them altogether. \"Our reasons for opposing these investigations are not captious or trivial. They have deep roots in principle and conscience. Let me explain with reference to the present New Hampshire investigation. The official purpose of the inquiry is to uncover and lay the basis for the prosecution of persons who in one way or another promote the forcible overthrow of constitutional forms of government. Leaving aside the question of the constitutionality of the investigation, which is now before the courts, I think it must be plain to any reasonable person who is at all well informed about conditions in New Hampshire today that strict adherence to this purpose would leave little room for investigation. It is obvious \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 239]\n\u00a0\n enough that there are few radicals or dissenters of any kind in New Hampshire; and if there are any who advocate use of force and violence, they must be isolated crackpots who are no danger to anyone, least of all to the constitutional form of government of state and nation. The Attorney General should be able to check these facts quickly and issue a report satisfying the mandate laid upon him by the legislature. \"But this is not what he has done. We do not know the whole story, but enough has come out to show that the Attorney General has issued a considerable number of subpoenas and has held hearings in various parts of the state. And so far as the available information allows us to judge, most of those subpoenaed have fallen into one or both of two groups: first professors at Dartmouth and the University of New Hampshire who have gained a reputation for liberal or otherwise unorthodox views, and, second, people who have been active in the Progressive Party. It should be specially noted that whatever may be thought of the Progressive Party in any other respect, it was certainly not devoted to violent overthrow of constitutional forms of government but on the contrary to effecting reforms through the very democratic procedures which are the essence of constitutional forms of government. \"The pattern I have described is no accident. Whatever their official purpose, these investigations always end up by inquiring into the politics, ideas, and beliefs of people who hold what are, for the time being, unpopular views. The federal House Committee on Un-American Activities, for example, is supposed to investigate various kinds of propaganda and has no other mandate whatever. Over the years, however, it has spent almost no time investigating propaganda and has devoted almost all of its energies to `exposing' people and their ideas, their affiliations, their associations. Similarly, this New Hampshire investigation is supposed to be concerned with violent overthrow of government, but it is actually turning out to be concerned with what few manifestations of political dissent have made themselves felt in the state in recent years. \"If all this is so, and if the very first principle of the American constitutional form of government is political freedom - which I take to include freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association - then I do not see how it can be denied that these investigations are a \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 241]\n\u00a0\n grave danger to all that Americans have always claimed to cherish. No rights are genuine if a person, for exercising them, can be hauled up before some tribunal and forced under penalties of perjury and contempt to account for his ideas and conduct. \"Let us now return to the problem of the witness who would have nothing to fear from being what is nowadays styled a `friendly' witness, but who feels deeply that to follow such a course would be a betrayal of his principles and repugnant to his conscience. What other courses are open to him? \"He can claim the privilege not to be a witness against himself and thus avoid a hateful inquisition. I respect the decision of those who elect to take this course. My own reason for rejecting it is that, with public opinion in its present state, the exercise of the privilege is almost certain to be widely misinterpreted. One of the noblest and most precious guarantees of freedom, won in the course of bitter struggles and terrible suffering, has been distorted in our own day to mean a confession of guilt, the more sinister because undefined and indeed undefinable. It is unfortunate, but true, that the public at large has accepted this distortion and will scarcely listen to those who have invoked the privilege. \"Alternatively, the witness can seek to uphold his principles and maintain his integrity, not by claiming the protection of the Fifth Amendment (or the Fifteenth Article of the New Hampshire Bill of Rights), but by contesting the legitimacy of offensive questions on other constitutional and legal grounds. \"Just how far the First Amendment limits the right of legislative inquiry has not been settled. The Supreme Court of the United States is at this very moment considering a case (the Emspak case) which may do much to settle the question. But even before the Court has handed down its decision in the Emspak case, it is quite certain that the First Amendment does place some limitations on the power of investigation, and it is always open to a witness to challenge a question on the ground that it transgresses these limitations and, if necessary, to take the issue to the courts for decision. \"Moreover, a witness may not be required to answer questions unless they are `pertinent to the matter under inquiry' (the words are those of the United States Supreme Court). \"What is the `matter under inquiry' in the present investigation? According to the Act of the New Hampshire legislature directing \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 242]\n\u00a0\n the investigation, its purpose is twofold: (1) `to make full and complete investigation with respect to violations of the subversive activities act of 1951,' and (2) `to determine whether subversive persons as defined in said act are presently located within this state.' \"I have studied the subversive activities act of 1951 with care, and I am glad to volunteer the information that I have absolutely no knowledge of any violations of any of its provisions; further, that I have no knowledge of subversive persons presently located within the state. \"That these statements may carry full conviction, I am prepared to answer certain questions about myself, though in doing so I do not mean to concede the right to ask them. I am also prepared to discuss my views relating to the use of force and violence to overthrow constitutional forms of government. \"But I shall respectfully decline to answer questions concerning ideas, beliefs, and associations which could not possibly be pertinent to the matter here under inquiry and\/or which seem to me to invade the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (which, of course, applies equally to the several states).\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Progressive Party offered a slate of candidates for national office in the 1948 presidential election. Henry A. Wallace, former Vice President of the United States, was the party's selection for the presidency. Glen Taylor, former United States Senator, was the vice-presidential nominee of the party. Nationwide, the party received a popular vote of 1,156,103. Of this total, 1,970 votes for Progressive Party candidates were cast in New Hampshire. Statistics of the Presidential and Congressional Election of November 2, 1948, pp. 24, 48-49.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See note 5, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The court made a general ruling that questions concerning the opinions or beliefs of the witness were not pertinent. Nevertheless, it did propound to the witness the one question about his belief in Communism.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] \"`Subversive person' means any person who commits, attempts to commit, or aids in the commission, or advocates, abets, advises or teaches, by any means any person to commit, attempt to commit, or aid in the commission of any act intended to overthrow, destroy or alter, or to assist in the overthrow, destruction or alteration of, the constitutional form of the government of the United States, or of the state of New Hampshire, or any political subdivision of either of them, by force, or violence; or who is a member of a subversive organization or a foreign subversive organization.\" N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann., 1955, c. 588, 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] \"For the purpose of this chapter `organization' means an organization, corporation, company, partnership, association, trust, foundation, fund, club, society, committee, political party, or any group of persons, whether or not incorporated, permanently or temporarily associated together for joint action or advancement of views on any subject or subjects. \"`Subversive organization' means any organization which engages in or advocates, abets, advises, or teaches, or a purpose of which is to engage in or advocate, abet, advise, or teach activities intended to overthrow, destroy or alter, or to assist in the overthrow, destruction or alteration of, the constitutional form of the government of the United States, or of the state of New Hampshire, or of any political subdivision of either of them, by force, or violence.\" Ibid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The State Supreme Court illustrated the \"reasonable or reliable\" information underlying the inquiries on the Progressive Party by quoting from a remark made by the Attorney General at the hearing in answer to petitioner's objection to a line of questions. The Attorney General had declared that he had \". . . considerable sworn testimony . . . to the effect that the Progressive Party in New Hampshire has been heavily infiltrated by members of the Communist Party and that the policies and purposes of the Progressive Party have been directly influenced by members of the Communist Party.\" 100 N. H., at 111, 121 A. 2d, at 790-791. None of this testimony is a part of the record in this case. Its existence and weight were not independently reviewed by the state courts. The court did not point to anything that supported the questioning \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 253]\n\u00a0\n on the subject of the lecture. It stated that the Attorney General could inquire about lectures only if he \". . . possesses reasonable or reliable information indicating that the violent overthrow of existing government may have been advocated or taught, either `knowingly and wilfully' or not.\" 100 N. H., at 110, 121 A. 2d, at 789-790. What, if anything, indicated that petitioner knowingly or innocently advocated or taught violent overthrow of existing government does not appear. At one point in the hearing, the Attorney General said to petitioner: \"I have in the file here a statement from a person who attended your class, and I will read it in part because I don't want you to think I am just fishing. `His talk this time was on the inevitability of the Socialist program. It was a glossed-over interpretation of the materialist dialectic.'\" R. 107. The court did not cite this statement.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, concurring in the result.\n\nFor me this is a very different case from Watkins v. United States, ante, p. 178. This case comes to us solely through the limited power to review the action of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 256]\n\u00a0\n States conferred upon the Court by the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioner claims that respect for liberties guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of that Amendment precludes the State of New Hampshire from compelling him to answer certain questions put to him by the investigating arm of its legislature. Ours is the narrowly circumscribed but exceedingly difficult task of making the final judicial accommodation between the competing weighty claims that underlie all such questions of due process.\n\nIn assessing the claim of the State of New Hampshire to the information denied it by petitioner, we cannot concern ourselves with the fact that New Hampshire chose to make its Attorney General in effect a standing committee of its legislature for the purpose of investigating the extent of \"subversive\" activities within its bounds. The case must be judged as though the whole body of the legislature had demanded the information of petitioner. It would make the deepest inroads upon our federal system for this Court now to hold that it can determine the appropriate distribution of powers and their delegation within the forty-eight States. As the earlier Mr. Justice Harlan said for a unanimous Court in Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71, 84\n:\n\n\"Whether the legislative, executive and judicial powers of a State shall be kept altogether distinct and separate, or whether persons or collections of persons belonging to one department may, in respect to some matters, exert powers which, strictly speaking, pertain to another department of government, is for the determination of the State. And its determination one way or the other cannot be an element in the inquiry whether the due process of law prescribed by the Fourteenth Amendment has been respected by the State or its representatives when dealing with matters involving life or liberty.\" \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 257]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Whether the state legislature should operate largely by committees, as does the Congress, or whether committees should be the exception, as is true of the House of Commons, whether the legislature should have two chambers or only one, as in Nebraska, whether the State's chief executive should have the pardoning power, whether the State's judicial branch must provide trial by jury, are all matters beyond the reviewing powers of this Court. Similarly, whether the Attorney General of New Hampshire acted within the scope of the authority given him by the state legislature is a matter for the decision of the courts of that State, as it is for the federal courts to determine whether an agency to which Congress has delegated power has acted within the confines of its mandate. See United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n. Sanction of the delegation rests with the New Hampshire Supreme Court, and its validation in Nelson v. Wyman, 99 N. H. 33, 105 A. 2d 756, is binding here.\n\nPursuant to an investigation of subversive activities authorized by a joint resolution of both houses of the New Hampshire Legislature, the State Attorney General subpoenaed petitioner before him on January 8, 1954, for extensive questioning. Among the matters about which petitioner was questioned were: details of his career and personal life, whether he was then or ever had been a member of the Communist Party, whether he had ever attended its meetings, whether he had ever attended meetings that he knew were also attended by Party members, whether he knew any Communists in or out of the State, whether he knew named persons with alleged connections with organizations either on the United States Attorney General's list or cited by the Un-American Activities Committee of the United States House of Representatives or had ever attended meetings with them, whether he had ever taught or supported the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 258]\n\u00a0\n overthrow of the State by force or violence or had ever known or assisted any persons or groups that had done so, whether he had ever been connected with organizations on the Attorney General's list, whether he had supported or written in behalf of a variety of allegedly subversive, named causes, conferences, periodicals, petitions, and attempts to raise funds for the legal defense of certain persons, whether he knew about the Progressive Party, what positions he had held in it, whether he had been a candidate for Presidential Elector for that Party, whether certain persons were in that Party, whether Communists had influenced or been members of the Progressive Party, whether he had sponsored activities in behalf of the candidacy of Henry A. Wallace, whether he advocated replacing the capitalist system with another economic system, whether his conception of socialism involved force and violence, whether by his writings and actions he had ever attempted to advance the Soviet Union's \"propaganda line,\" whether he had ever attended meetings of the Liberal Club at the University of New Hampshire, whether the magazine of which he was co-editor was \"a Communist-line publication,\" and whether he knew named persons.\n\nPetitioner answered most of these questions, making it very plain that he had never been a Communist, never taught violent overthrow of the Government, never knowingly associated with Communists in the State, but was a socialist believer in peaceful change who had at one time belonged to certain organizations on the list of the United States Attorney General (which did not include the Progressive Party) or cited by the House Un-American Activities Committee. He declined to answer as irrelevant or violative of free speech guarantees certain questions about the Progressive Party and whether he knew particular persons. He stated repeatedly, however, that \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 259]\n\u00a0\n he had no knowledge of Communists or of Communist influence in the Progressive Party, and he testified that he had been a candidate for that Party, signing the required loyalty oath, and that he did not know whether an alleged Communist leader was active in the Progressive Party.\n\nDespite the exhaustive scope of this inquiry, the Attorney General again subpoenaed petitioner to testify on June 3, 1954, and the interrogation was similarly sweeping. Petitioner again answered virtually all questions, including those concerning the relationship of named persons to the Communist Party or other causes deemed subversive under state laws, alleged Communist influence on all organizations with which he had been connected including the Progressive Party, and his own participation in organizations other than the Progressive Party and its antecedent, the Progressive Citizens of America. He refused, however, to answer certain questions regarding (1) a lecture given by him at the University of New Hampshire, (2) activities of himself and others in the Progressive political organizations, and (3) \"opinions and beliefs,\" invoking the constitutional guarantees of free speech.\n\nThe Attorney General then petitioned the Superior Court to order petitioner to answer questions in these categories. The court ruled that petitioner had to answer those questions pertaining to the lectures and to the Progressive Party and its predecessor but not those otherwise pertaining to \"opinions and beliefs.\" Upon petitioner's refusal to answer the questions sanctioned by the court, he was found in contempt of court and ordered committed to the county jail until purged of contempt.\n\nThe Supreme Court of New Hampshire affirmed the order of the Superior Court. It held that the questions at issue were relevant and that no constitutional provision permitted petitioner to frustrate the State's demands. 100 N. H. 103, 121 A. 2d 783. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 260]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe questions that petitioner refused to answer regarding the university lecture, the third given by him in three years at the invitation of the faculty for humanities, were:\n\n \"What was the subject of your lecture?\"\n\n\n \"Didn't you tell the class at the University of New Hampshire on Monday, March 22, 1954, that Socialism was inevitable in this country?\"\n\n\n \"Did you advocate Marxism at that time?\"\n\n\n \"Did you express the opinion, or did you make the statement at that time that Socialism was inevitable in America?\"\n\n\n \"Did you in this last lecture on March 22 or in any of the former lectures espouse the theory of dialectical materialism?\"\n\n\n \"I have in the file here a statement from a person who attended your class, and I will read it in part because I don't want you to think I am just fishing. `His talk this time was on the inevitability of the Socialist program. It was a glossed-over interpretation of the materialist dialectic.' Now, again I ask you the original question.\"\n\n\n In response to the first question of this series, petitioner had said at the hearing:\n\n \"I would like to say one thing in this connection, Mr. Wyman. I stated under oath at my last appearance that, and I now repeat it, that I do not advocate or in any way further the aim of overthrowing constitutional government by force and violence. I did not so advocate in the lecture I gave at the University of New Hampshire. In fact I have never at any time so advocated in a lecture anywhere. Aside from that I have nothing I want to say about the lecture in question.\"\n\n\n The New Hampshire Supreme Court, although recognizing that such inquiries \"undoubtedly interfered with \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 261]\n\u00a0\n the defendant's free exercise\" of his constitutionally guaranteed right to lecture, justified the interference on the ground that it would occur \"in the limited area in which the legislative committee may reasonably believe that the overthrow of existing government by force and violence is being or has been taught, advocated or planned, an area in which the interest of the State justifies this intrusion upon civil liberties.\" 100 N. H., at 113, 114, 121 A. 2d, at 792. According to the court, the facts that made reasonable the Committee's belief that petitioner had taught violent overthrow in his lecture were that he was a Socialist with a record of affiliation with groups cited by the Attorney General of the United States or the House Un-American Activities Committee and that he was co-editor of an article stating that, although the authors hated violence, it was less to be deplored when used by the Soviet Union than by capitalist countries.\n\nWhen weighed against the grave harm resulting from governmental intrusion into the intellectual life of a university, such justification for compelling a witness to discuss the contents of his lecture appears grossly inadequate. Particularly is this so where the witness has sworn that neither in the lecture nor at any other time did he ever advocate overthrowing the Government by force and violence.\n\nProgress in the natural sciences is not remotely confined to findings made in the laboratory. Insights into the mysteries of nature are born of hypothesis and speculation. The more so is this true in the pursuit of understanding in the groping endeavors of what are called the social sciences, the concern of which is man and society. The problems that are the respective preoccupations of anthropology, economics, law, psychology, sociology and related areas of scholarship are merely departmentalized dealing, by way of manageable division of analysis, with interpenetrating aspects of holistic perplexities. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 262]\n\u00a0\n For society's good - if understanding be an essential need of society - inquiries into these problems, speculations about them, stimulation in others of reflection upon them, must be left as unfettered as possible. Political power must abstain from intrusion into this activity of freedom, pursued in the interest of wise government and the people's well-being, except for reasons that are exigent and obviously compelling.\n\nThese pages need not be burdened with proof, based on the testimony of a cloud of impressive witnesses, of the dependence of a free society on free universities. This means the exclusion of governmental intervention in the intellectual life of a university. It matters little whether such intervention occurs avowedly or through action that inevitably tends to check the ardor and fearlessness of scholars, qualities at once so fragile and so indispensable for fruitful academic labor. One need only refer to the address of T. H. Huxley at the opening of Johns Hopkins University, the Annual Reports of President A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, the Reports of the University Grants Committee in Great Britain, as illustrative items in a vast body of literature. Suffice it to quote the latest expression on this subject. It is also perhaps the most poignant because its plea on behalf of continuing the free spirit of the open universities of South Africa has gone unheeded.\n\n \"In a university knowledge is its own end, not merely a means to an end. A university ceases to be true to its own nature if it becomes the tool of Church or State or any sectional interest. A university is characterized by the spirit of free inquiry, its ideal being the ideal of Socrates - `to follow the argument where it leads.' This implies the right to examine, question, modify or reject traditional ideas and beliefs. Dogma and hypothesis are incompatible, and the concept of an immutable doctrine is repugnant \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 263]\n\u00a0\n to the spirit of a university. The concern of its scholars is not merely to add and revise facts in relation to an accepted framework, but to be ever examining and modifying the framework itself.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Freedom to reason and freedom for disputation on the basis of observation and experiment are the necessary conditions for the advancement of scientific knowledge. A sense of freedom is also necessary for creative work in the arts which, equally with scientific research, is the concern of the university.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\". . . It is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation. It is an atmosphere in which there prevail `the four essential freedoms' of a university - to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study.\" The Open Universities in South Africa 10-12. (A statement of a conference of senior scholars from the University of Cape Town and the University of the Witwatersrand, including A. v. d. S. Centlivres and Richard Feetham, as Chancellors of the respective universities.\n1\n)\n\n\n I do not suggest that what New Hampshire has here sanctioned bears any resemblance to the policy against which this South African remonstrance was directed. I do say that in these matters of the spirit inroads on legitimacy must be resisted at their incipiency. This kind of evil grows by what it is allowed to feed on. The \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 264]\n\u00a0\n admonition of this Court in another context is applicable here. \"It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure.\" Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n.\n\nPetitioner stated, in response to questions at the hearing, that he did not know of any Communist interest in, connection with, influence over, activity in, or manipulation of the Progressive Party. He refused to answer, despite court order, the following questions on the ground that, by inquiring into the activities of a lawful political organization, they infringed upon the inviolability of the right to privacy in his political thoughts, actions and associations:\n\n \"Was she, Nancy Sweezy, your wife, active in the formation of the Progressive Citizens of America?\"\n\n\n \"Was Nancy Sweezy then working with individuals who were then members of the Communist Party?\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n \"Was Charles Beebe active in forming the Progressive Citizens of America?\"\n\n\n \"Did he work with your present wife - Did Charles Beebe work with your present wife in 1947?\"\n\n\n \"Did it [a meeting at the home of one Abraham Walenko] have anything to do with the Progressive Party?\" \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 265]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Supreme Court of New Hampshire justified this intrusion upon his freedom on the same basis that it upheld questioning about the university lecture, namely, that the restriction was limited to situations where the Committee had reason to believe that violent overthrow of the Government was being advocated or planned. It ruled:\n\n\". . . That he [the Attorney General] did possess information which was sufficient to reasonably warrant inquiry concerning the Progressive Party is evident from his statement made during the hearings held before him that `considerable sworn testimony has been given in this investigation to the effect that the Progressive Party in New Hampshire has been heavily infiltrated by members of the Communist Party and that the policies and purposes of the Progressive Party have been directly influenced by members of the Communist Party.'\" 100 N. H., at 111, 121 A. 2d, at 790.\n\n\n For a citizen to be made to forego even a part of so basic a liberty as his political autonomy, the subordinating interest of the State must be compelling. Inquiry pursued in safeguarding a State's security against threatened force and violence cannot be shut off by mere disclaimer, though of course a relevant claim may be made to the privilege against self-incrimination. (The New Hampshire Constitution guarantees this privilege.) But the inviolability of privacy belonging to a citizen's political loyalties has so overwhelming an importance to the well-being of our kind of society that it cannot be constitutionally encroached upon on the basis of so meagre a countervailing interest of the State as may be argumentatively found in the remote, shadowy threat to the security of New Hampshire allegedly presented in the origins and contributing elements of the Progressive Party and in petitioner's relations to these. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 266]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the political realm, as in the academic, thought and action are presumptively immune from inquisition by political authority. It cannot require argument that inquiry would be barred to ascertain whether a citizen had voted for one or the other of the two major parties either in a state or national election. Until recently, no difference would have been entertained in regard to inquiries about a voter's affiliations with one of the various so-called third parties that have had their day, or longer, in our political history. This is so, even though adequate protection of secrecy by way of the Australian ballot did not come into use till 1888. The implications of the United States Constitution for national elections and \"the concept of ordered liberty\" implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as against the States, Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 325\n, were not frozen as of 1789 or 1868, respectively. While the language of the Constitution does not change, the changing circumstances of a progressive society for which it was designed yield new and fuller import to its meaning. See Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516, 528\n-529; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316. Whatever, on the basis of massive proof and in the light of history, of which this Court may well take judicial notice, be the justification for not regarding the Communist Party as a conventional political party, no such justification has been afforded in regard to the Progressive Party. A foundation in fact and reason would have to be established far weightier than the intimations that appear in the record to warrant such a view of the Progressive Party.\n3\n This precludes the questioning that petitioner resisted in regard to that Party.\n\nTo be sure, this is a conclusion based on a judicial judgment in balancing two contending principles - the right \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 267]\n\u00a0\n of a citizen to political privacy, as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, and the right of the State to self-protection. And striking the balance implies the exercise of judgment. This is the inescapable judicial task in giving substantive content, legally enforced, to the Due Process Clause, and it is a task ultimately committed to this Court. It must not be an exercise of whim or will. It must be an overriding judgment founded on something much deeper and more justifiable than personal preference. As far as it lies within human limitations, it must be an impersonal judgment. It must rest on fundamental presuppositions rooted in history to which widespread acceptance may fairly be attributed. Such a judgment must be arrived at in a spirit of humility when it counters the judgment of the State's highest court. But, in the end, judgment cannot be escaped - the judgment of this Court. See concurring opinions in Haley v. Ohio, \n332 \nU.S. 596, 601\n; Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, \n329 \nU.S. 459, 466\n, 470-471; Malinski v. New York, \n324 \nU.S. 401, 412\n, 414-417.\n\nAnd so I am compelled to conclude that the judgment of the New Hampshire court must be reversed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Hon. A. v. d. S. Centlivres only recently retired as Chief Justice of South Africa, and the Hon. Richard Feetham is also an eminent, retired South African judge.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Inclusion of this question among the unanswered questions appears to have been an oversight in view of the fact that petitioner attempted to answer it at the hearing by stating that he had never to his knowledge known members of the Communist Party in New Hampshire. In any event, petitioner's brief states that he is willing to repeat the answer to this question if the Attorney General so desires. This is consistent with his demonstrated willingness to answer all inquiries regarding the Communist Party, including its relation to the Progressive Party.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Progressive Party was on the ballot in forty-four States, including New Hampshire, in 1948, and in twenty-six States in 1952.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON joins, dissenting.\n\nThe Court today has denied the State of New Hampshire the right to investigate the extent of \"subversive activities\" within its boundaries in the manner chosen by its legislature. Unfortunately there is no opinion for the Court, for those who reverse are divided and they do so on entirely different grounds. Four of my Brothers join in what I shall call the principal opinion. They hold that the appointment of the Attorney General to act as a committee for the legislature results in a separation of its power to investigate from its \"responsibility to direct the use of that power\" and thereby \"causes a deprivation \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 268]\n\u00a0\n of the constitutional rights of individuals and a denial of due process . . . .\" This theory was not raised by the parties and is, indeed, a novel one.\n\nMy Brothers FRANKFURTER and HARLAN do not agree with this opinion because they conclude, as do I, that the internal affairs of the New Hampshire State Government are of no concern to us. See Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71, 84\n (1902). They do join in the reversal, however, on the ground that Sweezy's rights under the First Amendment have been violated. I agree with neither opinion.\n\nThe principal opinion finds that \"The Attorney General has been given such a sweeping and uncertain mandate that it is his decision which picks out the subjects that will be pursued, what witnesses will be summoned and what questions will be asked.\" The New Hampshire Act clearly indicates that it was the legislature that determined the general subject matter of the investigation, subversive activities; the legislature's committee, the Attorney General, properly decided what witnesses should be called and what questions should be asked. My Brothers surely would not have the legislature as a whole make these decisions. But they conclude, nevertheless, that it cannot be said that the legislature \"asked the Attorney General to gather the kind of facts comprised in the subjects upon which petitioner was interrogated.\" It follows, says this opinion, that there is no \"assurance that the questions petitioner refused to answer fall into a category of matters upon which the legislature wanted to be informed . . . .\" But New Hampshire's Supreme Court has construed the state statute. It has declared the purpose to be to investigate \"subversive\" activities within the State; it has approved the use of the \"one-man\" technique; it has said the questions were all relevant to the legislative purpose. In effect the state court says the Attorney General was \"directed\" to inquire as he did. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 269]\n\u00a0\n Furthermore, the legislature renewed the Act in the same language twice in the year following Sweezy's interrogation. N. H. Laws 1955, c. 197. In ratifying the Attorney General's action it used these words: \"The investigation . . . provided for by chapter 307 of the Laws of 1953, as continued by a resolution approved January 13, 1955, is hereby continued in full force and effect, in form, manner and authority as therein provided . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) We are bound by the state court findings. We have no right to strike down the state action unless we find not only that there has been a deprivation of Sweezy's constitutional rights, but that the interest in protecting those rights is greater than the State's interest in uncovering subversive activities within its confines. The majority has made no such findings.\n\nThe short of it is that the Court blocks New Hampshire's effort to enforce its law. I had thought that in Pennsylvania v. Nelson, \n350 \nU.S. 497\n (1956), we had left open for legitimate state control any subversive activity leveled against the interest of the State. I for one intended to suspend state action only in the field of subversion against the Nation and thus avoid a race to the courthouse door between federal and state prosecutors. Cases concerning subversive activities against the National Government have such interstate ramifications that individual state action might effectively destroy a prosecution on the national level. I thought we had left open a wide field for state action, but implicit in the opinions today is a contrary conclusion. They destroy the fact-finding power of the State in this field and I dissent from this wide sweep of their coverage.\n\nThe principal opinion discusses, by way of dictum, due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the basis of the opinion is not placed on this ground, I would not think it necessary to raise it here. However, my Brothers say that the definition of \"subversive person\" \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 270]\n\u00a0\n lacks \"a necessary element of guilty knowledge . . . .\" Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n (1952), is heavily depended upon as authority for the view expressed. I do not so regard it. I authored that opinion. It was a loyalty oath case in which Oklahoma had declared ipso facto disqualified any employee of the State who failed to take a prescribed oath that, inter alia, he belonged to no subversive organizations. We struck down the Act for lack of a requirement of scienter. We said there that \"constitutional protection . . . extend[s] to the public servant whose exclusion pursuant to a statute is patently arbitrary or discriminatory.\" Id., at 192. But Sweezy is not charged as a \"subversive person\" and the Committee has made no finding that he is. In fact, had he been found to be such a person, there is no sanction under the Act. New Hampshire is invoking no statute like Oklahoma's. Its Act excludes no one from anything. Updegraff stands for no such broad abstraction as the principal opinion suggests.\n\nSince the conclusion of a majority of those reversing is not predicated on the First Amendment questions presented, I see no necessity for discussing them. But since the principal opinion devotes itself largely to these issues I believe it fair to ask why they have been given such an elaborate treatment when the case is decided on an entirely different ground. It is of no avail to quarrel with a straw man. My view on First Amendment problems in this type of case is expressed in my dissent in Watkins, decided today, ante, p. 217. Since a majority of the Court has not passed on these problems here, and since I am not convinced that the State's interest in investigating subversive activities for the protection of its citizens is outweighed by any necessity for the protection of Sweezy I would affirm the judgment of the New Hampshire Supreme Court. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 234, 271]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEAMSTERS UNION v. VOGT, INC.(1957)\nNo. 79\nArgued: February 26, 1957Decided: June 17, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Respondent owns and operates a gravel pit in Wisconsin, where it employs 15 to 20 men. Petitioner unions sought unsuccessfully to induce some of respondent's employees to join the unions and began picketing the entrance to respondent's gravel pit with signs reading, \"The men on this job are not 100% affiliated with the A. F. L.\" As a result, drivers of several trucking companies refused to deliver and haul goods to and from respondent's plant, causing substantial damage to respondent. On respondent's application, a State Court enjoined the picketing. The injunction was sustained by the State Supreme Court on findings by it that (1) the picketing had been engaged in for the purpose of coercing respondent to force its employees to become members of petitioner unions, and (2) such picketing was for \"an unlawful purpose,\" since Wis. Stat. 111.06 (2) (b) made it an unfair labor practice for an employee individually or in concert with others to \"coerce, intimidate or induce an employer to interfere with any of his employes in the enjoyment of their legal rights . . . or to engage in any practice with regard to his employes which would constitute an unfair labor practice if undertaken by him on his own initiative.\" Held: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 285-295.\n\n (a) Prior decisions of this Court have established a broad field in which a State, in enforcing some public policy, whether of its criminal or its civil law, and whether announced by its legislature or its courts, may constitutionally enjoin peaceful picketing aimed at preventing effectuation of that policy. Pp. 287-293.\n\n\n (b) Consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, a State may enjoin peaceful picketing the purpose of which is to coerce an employer to put pressure on his employees to join a union in violation of the declared policy of the State. Pappas v. Stacey, 151 Me. 36, 116 A. 2d 497, appeal dismissed, \n350 \nU.S. 870\n. Pp. 293-295.\n\n\n 270 Wis. 321a, 74 N. W. 2d 749, affirmed. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 285]\n\u00a0\n\n\nDavid Previant argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioners.\n\nLeon B. Lamfrom argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Jacob L. Bernheim.\n\nJ. Albert Woll and Thomas E. Harris filed a brief for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is one more in the long series of cases in which this Court has been required to consider the limits imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment on the power of a State to enjoin picketing. The case was heard below on the pleadings and affidavits, the parties stipulating that the record contained \"all of the facts and evidence that would be adduced upon a trial on the merits . . . .\" Respondent owns and operates a gravel pit in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, where it employs 15 to 20 men. Petitioner unions sought unsuccessfully to induce some of respondent's employees to join the unions and commenced to picket the entrance to respondent's place of business with signs reading, \"The men on this job are not 100% affiliated with the A. F. L.\" \"In consequence,\" drivers of several trucking companies refused to deliver and haul goods to and from respondent's plant, causing substantial damage to respondent. Respondent thereupon sought an injunction to restrain the picketing.\n\nThe trial court did not make the finding, requested by respondent, \"That the picketing of plaintiff's premises has been engaged in for the purpose of coercing, intimidating and inducing the employer to force, compel, or induce its employees to become members of defendant labor organizations, and for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff in its \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 286]\n\u00a0\n business because of its refusal to in any way interfere with the rights of its employees to join or not to join a labor organization.\" It nevertheless held that by virtue of Wis. Stat. 103.535, prohibiting picketing in the absence of a \"labor dispute,\" the petitioners must be enjoined from maintaining any pickets near respondent's place of business, from displaying at any place near respondent's place of business signs indicating that there was a labor dispute between respondent and its employees or between respondent and any of the petitioners, and from inducing others to decline to transport goods to and from respondent's business establishment.\n\nOn appeal, the Wisconsin Supreme Court at first reversed, relying largely on A. F. of L. v. Swing, \n312 \nU.S. 321\n, to hold 103.535 unconstitutional, on the ground that picketing could not constitutionally be enjoined merely because of the absence of a \"labor dispute.\" 270 Wis. 315, 71 N. W. 2d 359.\n\nUpon reargument, however, the court withdrew its original opinion. Although the trial court had refused to make the finding requested by respondent, the Supreme Court, noting that the facts as to which the request was made were undisputed, drew the inference from the undisputed facts and itself made the finding. It canvassed the whole circumstances surrounding the picketing and held that \"One would be credulous, indeed, to believe under the circumstances that the union had no thought of coercing the employer to interfere with its employees in their right to join or refuse to join the defendant union.\" Such picketing, the court held, was for \"an unlawful purpose,\" since Wis. Stat. 111.06 (2) (b) made it an unfair labor practice for an employee individually or in concert with others to \"coerce, intimidate or induce any employer to interfere with any of his employes in the enjoyment of their legal rights . . . or to engage in any practice with regard to his employes which would \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 287]\n\u00a0\n constitute an unfair labor practice if undertaken by him on his own initiative.\" Relying on Building Service Employees v. Gazzam, \n339 \nU.S. 532\n, and Pappas v. Stacey, 151 Me. 36, 116 A. 2d 497, the Wisconsin Supreme Court therefore affirmed the granting of the injunction on this different ground. 270 Wis. 321a, 74 N. W. 2d 749.\n\nWe are asked to reverse the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which to a large extent rested its decision on that of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in Pappas v. Stacey, supra. When an appeal from that decision was filed here, this Court granted appellee's motion to dismiss for lack of a substantial federal question. \n350 \nU.S. 870\n. Since the present case presents a similar question, we might well have denied certiorari on the strength of our decision in that case. In view of the recurrence of the question, we thought it advisable to grant certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 817\n, and to restate the principles governing this type of case.\n\nIt is inherent in the concept embodied in the Due Process Clause that its scope be determined by a \"gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion,\" Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97, 104\n. Inevitably, therefore, the doctrine of a particular case \"is not allowed to end with its enunciation and . . . an expression in an opinion yields later to the impact of facts unforeseen.\" Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, \n271 \nU.S. 609, 619\n (Brandeis, J., dissenting). It is not too surprising that the response of States - legislative and judicial - to use of the injunction in labor controversies should have given rise to a series of adjudications in this Court relating to the limitations on state action contained in the provisions of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is also not too surprising that examination of these adjudications should disclose an evolving, not a static, course of decision.\n\nThe series begins with Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312\n, in which a closely divided Court found it to be violative \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 288]\n\u00a0\n of the Equal Protection Clause - not of the Due Process Clause - for a State to deny use of the injunction in the special class of cases arising out of labor conflicts. The considerations that underlay that case soon had to yield, through legislation and later through litigation, to the persuasiveness of undermining facts. Thus, to remedy the abusive use of the injunction in the federal courts (see Frankfurter and Greene, The Labor Injunction), the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C. 101, withdrew, subject to qualifications, jurisdiction from the federal courts to issue injunctions in labor disputes to prohibit certain acts. Its example was widely followed by state enactments.\n\nApart from remedying the abuses of the injunction in this general type of litigation, legislatures and courts began to find in one of the aims of picketing an aspect of communication. This view came to the fore in Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468\n, where the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not prohibit Wisconsin from authorizing peaceful stranger picketing by a union that was attempting to unionize a shop and to induce an employer to refrain from working in his business as a laborer.\n\nAlthough the Court had been closely divided in the Senn case, three years later, in passing on a restrictive instead of a permissive state statute, the Court made sweeping pronouncements about the right to picket in holding unconstitutional a statute that had been applied to ban all picketing, with \"no exceptions based upon either the number of persons engaged in the proscribed activity, the peaceful character of their demeanor, the nature of their dispute with an employer, or the restrained character and the accurateness of the terminology used in notifying the public of the facts of the dispute.\" Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 99\n. As the statute dealt at large with all picketing, so the Court broadly \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 289]\n\u00a0\n assimilated peaceful picketing in general to freedom of speech, and as such protected against abridgment by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThese principles were applied by the Court in A. F. of L. v. Swing, \n312 \nU.S. 321\n, to hold unconstitutional an injunction against peaceful picketing, based on a State's common-law policy against picketing when there was no immediate dispute between employer and employee. On the same day, however, the Court upheld a generalized injunction against picketing where there had been violence because \"it could justifiably be concluded that the momentum of fear generated by past violence would survive even though future picketing might be wholly peaceful.\" Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, \n312 \nU.S. 287, 294\n.\n\nSoon, however, the Court came to realize that the broad pronouncements, but not the specific holding, of Thornhill had to yield \"to the impact of facts unforeseen,\" or at least not sufficiently appreciated. Cf. People v. Schweinler Press, 214 N. Y. 395, 108 N. E. 639, 28 Harv. L. Rev. 790. Cases reached the Court in which a State had designed a remedy to meet a specific situation or to accomplish a particular social policy. These cases made manifest that picketing, even though \"peaceful,\" involved more than just communication of ideas and could not be immune from all state regulation. \"Picketing by an organized group is more than free speech, since it involves patrol of a particular locality and since the very presence of a picket line may induce action of one kind or another, quite irrespective of the nature of the ideas which are being disseminated.\" Bakery Drivers Local v. Wohl, \n315 \nU.S. 769, 776\n (concurring opinion); see Carpenters Union v. Ritter's Cafe, \n315 \nU.S. 722, 725\n-728.\n\nThese latter two cases required the Court to review a choice made by two States between the competing interests of unions, employers, their employees, and the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 290]\n\u00a0\n public at large. In the Ritter's Cafe case, Texas had enjoined as a violation of its antitrust law picketing of a restaurant by unions to bring pressure on its owner with respect to the use of nonunion labor by a contractor of the restaurant owner in the construction of a building having nothing to do with the restaurant. The Court held that Texas could, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, insulate from the dispute a neutral establishment that industrially had no connection with it. This type of picketing certainly involved little, if any, \"communication.\"\n\nIn Bakery Drivers Local v. Wohl, \n315 \nU.S. 769\n, in a very narrowly restricted decision, the Court held that because of the impossibility of otherwise publicizing a legitimate grievance and because of the slight effect on \"strangers\" to the dispute, a State could not constitutionally prohibit a union from picketing bakeries in its efforts to have independent peddlers, buying from bakers and selling to small stores, conform to certain union requests. Although the Court in Ritter's Cafe and Wohl did not question the holding of Thornhill, the strong reliance on the particular facts in each case demonstrated a growing awareness that these cases involved not so much questions of free speech as review of the balance struck by a State between picketing that involved more than \"publicity\" and competing interests of state policy. (See also Cafeteria Union v. Angelos, \n320 \nU.S. 293\n, where the Court reviewed a New York injunction against picketing by a union of a restaurant that was run by the owners without employees. The New York court appeared to have justified an injunction on the alternate grounds that there was no \"labor dispute\" under the New York statute or that use of untruthful placards justified the injunction. We held, in a brief opinion, that the abuses alleged \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 291]\n\u00a0\n did not justify an injunction against all picketing and that A. F. of L. v. Swing governed the alternate ground for decision.)\n\nThe implied reassessments of the broad language of the Thornhill case were finally generalized in a series of cases sustaining injunctions against peaceful picketing, even when arising in the course of a labor controversy, when such picketing was counter to valid state policy in a domain open to state regulation. The decisive reconsideration came in Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490\n. A union, seeking to organize peddlers, picketed a wholesale dealer to induce it to refrain from selling to nonunion peddlers. The state courts, finding that such an agreement would constitute a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the state antitrust laws, enjoined the picketing. This Court affirmed unanimously.\n\n\"It is contended that the injunction against picketing adjacent to Empire's place of business is an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech because the picketers were attempting peacefully to publicize truthful facts about a labor dispute. . . . But the record here does not permit this publicizing to be treated in isolation. For according to the pleadings, the evidence, the findings, and the argument of the appellants, the sole immediate object of the publicizing adjacent to the premises of Empire, as well as the other activities of the appellants and their allies, was to compel Empire to agree to stop selling ice to nonunion peddlers. Thus all of appellants' activities . . . constituted a single and integrated course of conduct, which was in violation of Missouri's valid law. In this situation, the injunction did no more than enjoin an offense against Missouri law, a felony.\" Id., at 497-498. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 292]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Court therefore concluded that it was \"clear that appellants were doing more than exercising a right of free speech or press. . . . They were exercising their economic power together with that of their allies to compel Empire to abide by union rather than by state regulation of trade.\" Id., at 503.\n\nThe following Term, the Court decided a group of cases applying and elaborating on the theory of Giboney. In Hughes v. Superior Court, \n339 \nU.S. 460\n, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not bar use of the injunction to prohibit picketing of a place of business solely to secure compliance with a demand that its employees be hired in percentage to the racial origin of its customers. \"We cannot construe the Due Process Clause as precluding California from securing respect for its policy against involuntary employment on racial lines by prohibiting systematic picketing that would subvert such policy.\" Id., at 466. The Court also found it immaterial that the state policy had been expressed by the judiciary rather than by the legislature.\n\nOn the same day, the Court decided Teamsters Union v. Hanke, \n339 \nU.S. 470\n, holding that a State was not restrained by the Fourteenth Amendment from enjoining picketing of a business, conducted by the owner himself without employees, in order to secure compliance with a demand to become a union shop. Although there was no one opinion for the Court, its decision was another instance of the affirmance of an injunction against picketing because directed against a valid public policy of the State.\n\nA third case, Building Service Employees v. Gazzam, \n339 \nU.S. 532\n, was decided the same day. Following an unsuccessful attempt at unionization of a small hotel and refusal by the owner to sign a contract with the union as bargaining agent, the union began to picket the hotel with signs stating that the owner was unfair to organized \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 293]\n\u00a0\n labor. The State, finding that the object of the picketing was in violation of its statutory policy against employer coercion of employees' choice of bargaining representative, enjoined picketing for such purpose. This Court affirmed, rejecting the argument that \"the Swing case, supra, is controlling. . . . In that case this Court struck down the State's restraint of picketing based solely on the absence of an employer-employee relationship. An adequate basis for the instant decree is the unlawful objective of the picketing, namely, coercion by the employer of the employees' selection of a bargaining representative. Peaceful picketing for any lawful purpose is not prohibited by the decree under review.\" Id., at 539.\n\nA similar problem was involved in Plumbers Union v. Graham, \n345 \nU.S. 192\n, where a state court had enjoined, as a violation of its \"Right to Work\" law, picketing that advertised that nonunion men were being employed on a building job. This Court found that there was evidence in the record supporting a conclusion that a substantial purpose of the picketing was to put pressure on the general contractor to eliminate nonunion men from the job and, on the reasoning of the cases that we have just discussed, held that the injunction was not in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis series of cases, then, established a broad field in which a State, in enforcing some public policy, whether of its criminal or its civil law, and whether announced by its legislature or its courts, could constitutionally enjoin peaceful picketing aimed at preventing effectuation of that policy.\n\nIn the light of this background, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in 1955 decided, on an agreed statement of facts, the case of Pappas v. Stacey, 151 Me. 36, 116 A. 2d 497. From the statement, it appeared that three union employees went on strike and picketed a restaurant peacefully \"for the sole purpose of seeking to organize other \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 294]\n\u00a0\n employees of the Plaintiff, ultimately to have the Plaintiff enter into collective bargaining and negotiations with the Union . . . .\" Maine had a statute providing that workers should have full liberty of self-organization, free from restraint by employers or other persons. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court drew the inference from the agreed statement of facts that \"there is a steady and exacting pressure upon the employer to interfere with the free choice of the employees in the matter of organization. To say that the picketing is not designed to bring about such action is to forget an obvious purpose of picketing - to cause economic loss to the business during noncompliance by the employees with the request of the union.\" 151 Me., at 42, 116 A. 2d, at 500. It therefore enjoined the picketing, and an appeal was taken to this Court.\n\nThe whole series of cases discussed above allowing, as they did, wide discretion to a State in the formulation of domestic policy, and not involving a curtailment of free speech in its obvious and accepted scope, led this Court, without the need of further argument, to grant appellee's motion to dismiss the appeal in that it no longer presented a substantial federal question. \n350 \nU.S. 870\n.\n\nThe Stacey case is this case. As in Stacey, the present case was tried without oral testimony. As in Stacey, the highest state court drew the inference from the facts that the picketing was to coerce the employer to put pressure on his employees to join the union, in violation of the declared policy of the State. (For a declaration of similar congressional policy, see 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.S.C. 158.) The cases discussed above all hold that, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, a State may enjoin such conduct.\n\nOf course, the mere fact that there is \"picketing\" does not automatically justify its restraint without an investigation into its conduct and purposes. State courts, no \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 295]\n\u00a0\n more than state legislatures, can enact blanket prohibitions against picketing. Thornhill v. Alabama and A. F. of L. v. Swing, supra. The series of cases following Thornhill and Swing demonstrate that the policy of Wisconsin enforced by the prohibition of this picketing is a valid one. In this case, the circumstances set forth in the opinion of the Wisconsin Supreme Court afford a rational basis for the inference it drew concerning the purpose of the picketing. No question was raised here concerning the breadth of the injunction, but of course its terms must be read in the light of the opinion of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which justified it on the ground that the picketing was for the purpose of coercing the employer to coerce his employees. \"If astuteness may discover argumentative excess in the scope of the [injunction] beyond what we constitutionally justify by this opinion, it will be open to petitioners to raise the matter, which they have not raised here, when the [case] on remand [reaches] the [Wisconsin] court.\" Teamsters Union v. Hanke, \n339 \nU.S., at 480\n-481.\n\nTherefore, having deemed it appropriate to elaborate on the issues in the case, we affirm.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK concur, dissenting.\n\nThe Court has now come full circle. In Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 102\n, we struck down a state ban on picketing on the ground that \"the dissemination of information concerning the facts of a labor dispute must be regarded as within that area of free discussion that is guaranteed by the Constitution.\" Less than one year later, we held that the First Amendment protected organizational \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 296]\n\u00a0\n picketing on a factual record which cannot be distinguished from the one now before us. A. F. of L. v. Swing, \n312 \nU.S. 321\n. Of course, we have always recognized that picketing has aspects which make it more than speech. Bakery Drivers Local v. Wohl, \n315 \nU.S. 769, 776\n-777 (concurring opinion). That difference underlies our decision in Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490\n. There, picketing was an essential part of \"a single and integrated course of conduct, which was in violation of Missouri's valid law.\" Id., at 498. And see Labor Board v. Virginia Power Co., \n314 \nU.S. 469, 477\n-478. We emphasized that \"there was clear danger, imminent and immediate, that unless restrained, appellants would succeed in making [the state] policy a dead letter . . . .\" \n336 \nU.S., at 503\n. Speech there was enjoined because it was an inseparable part of conduct which the State constitutionally could and did regulate.\n\nBut where, as here, there is no rioting, no mass picketing, no violence, no disorder, no fisticuffs, no coercion - indeed nothing but speech - the principles announced in Thornhill and Swing should give the advocacy of one side of a dispute First Amendment protection.\n\nThe retreat began when, in Teamsters Union v. Hanke, \n339 \nU.S. 470\n, four members of the Court announced that all picketing could be prohibited if a state court decided that that picketing violated the State's public policy. The retreat became a rout in Plumbers Union v. Graham, \n345 \nU.S. 192\n. It was only the \"purpose\" of the picketing which was relevant. The state court's characterization of the picketers' \"purpose\" had been made well-nigh conclusive. Considerations of the proximity of picketing to conduct which the State could control or prevent were abandoned, and no longer was it necessary for the state court's decree to be narrowly drawn to prescribe a specific evil. Id., at 201-205 (dissenting opinion). \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 297]\n\u00a0\n\n\nToday, the Court signs the formal surrender. State courts and state legislatures cannot fashion blanket prohibitions on all picketing. But, for practical purposes, the situation now is as it was when Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468\n, was decided. State courts and state legislatures are free to decide whether to permit or suppress any particular picket line for any reason other than a blanket policy against all picketing. I would adhere to the principle announced in Thornhill. I would adhere to the result reached in Swing. I would return to the test enunciated in Giboney - that this form of expression can be regulated or prohibited only to the extent that it forms an essential part of a course of conduct which the State can regulate or prohibit. I would reverse the judgment below. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 284, 298]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEXTILE WORKERS v. LINCOLN MILLS(1957)\nNo. 211\nArgued: March 25, 1957Decided: June 3, 1957\n\n\n\n\n A union entered into a collective-bargaining agreement with an employer providing that there would be no strikes or work stoppages and that grievances would be handled pursuant to a specified procedure, the last step of which was arbitration. Grievances arose and were processed through various steps in the grievance procedure until the union's demands were finally denied by the employer. The union requested arbitration, and the employer refused. Thereupon, the union sued in a Federal District Court to compel arbitration. Held:\n\n 1. Under 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, the District Court properly decreed specific performance of the agreement to arbitrate the grievance dispute. Pp. 449-456.\n\n\n 2. The substantive law to be applied in suits under 301 (a) is federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws. Pp. 456-457.\n\n\n 3. As here construed, 301 (a) is constitutional. P. 457.\n\n\n 4. Jurisdiction to compel arbitration of grievance disputes is not withdrawn by the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Pp. 457-459.\n\n\n 5. The employer in this case having ceased operations and contracted to sell its mill properties, the case is moot insofar as the union sought restoration of workloads and job assignments; but it is not moot to the extent that it sought a monetary award. P. 459.\n\n\n 230 F.2d 81, reversed.\n\nArthur J. Goldberg argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Benjamin Wyle and David E. Feller.\n\nFrank A. Constangy argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were M. A. Prowell and Fred W. Elarbee, Jr. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 449]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner-union entered into a collective bargaining agreement in 1953 with respondent-employer, the agreement to run one year and from year to year thereafter, unless terminated on specified notices. The agreement provided that there would be no strikes or work stoppages and that grievances would be handled pursuant to a specified procedure. The last step in the grievance procedure - a step that could be taken by either party - was arbitration.\n\nThis controversy involves several grievances that concern work loads and work assignments. The grievances were processed through the various steps in the grievance procedure and were finally denied by the employer. The union requested arbitration, and the employer refused. Thereupon the union brought this suit in the District Court to compel arbitration.\n\nThe District Court concluded that it had jurisdiction and ordered the employer to comply with the grievance arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. The Court of Appeals reversed by a divided vote. 230 F.2d 81. It held that, although the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit, the court had no authority founded either in federal or state law to grant the relief. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the importance of the problem and the contrariety of views in the courts. \n352 \nU.S. 821\n.\n\nThe starting point of our inquiry is 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. 185, which provides:\n\n (a) \"Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 450]\n\u00a0\n defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\"\n\n\n (b) \"Any labor organization which represents employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter and any employer whose activities affect commerce as defined in this chapter shall be bound by the acts of its agents. Any such labor organization may use or be sued as an entity and in behalf of the employees whom it represents in the courts of the United States. Any money judgment against a labor organization in a district court of the United States shall be enforceable only against the organization as an entity and against its assets, and shall not be enforceable against any individual member or his assets.\"\n\n\n There has been considerable litigation involving 301 and courts have construed it differently. There is one view that 301 (a) merely gives federal district courts jurisdiction in controversies that involve labor organizations in industries affecting commerce, without regard to diversity of citizenship or the amount in controversy.\n1\n Under that view 301 (a) would not be the source of substantive law; it would neither supply federal law to resolve these controversies nor turn the federal judges to state law for answers to the questions. Other courts - the overwhelming number of them - hold that 301 (a) is \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 451]\n\u00a0\n more than jurisdictional\n2\n - that it authorizes federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of these collective bargaining agreements and includes within that federal law specific performance of promises to arbitrate grievances under collective bargaining agreements. Perhaps the leading decision representing that point of view is the one rendered by Judge Wyzanski in Textile Workers Union v. American Thread Co., 113 F. Supp. 137. That is our construction of 301 (a), which means that the agreement to arbitrate grievance disputes, contained in this collective bargaining agreement, should be specifically enforced.\n\nFrom the face of the Act it is apparent that 301 (a) and 301 (b) supplement one another. Section 301 (b) makes it possible for a labor organization, representing employees in an industry affecting commerce, to sue and be sued as an entity in the federal courts. Section 301 (b) in other words provides the procedural remedy lacking at common law. Section 301 (a) certainly does something more than that. Plainly, it supplies the basis \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 452]\n\u00a0\n upon which the federal district courts may take jurisdiction and apply the procedural rule of 301 (b). The question is whether 301 (a) is more than jurisdictional.\n\nThe legislative history of 301 is somewhat cloudy and confusing. But there are a few shafts of light that illuminate our problem.\n\nThe bills, as they passed the House and the Senate, contained provisions which would have made the failure to abide by an agreement to arbitrate an unfair labor practice. S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 20-21, 23; H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 21.\n3\n This feature of the law was dropped in Conference. As the Conference Report stated, \"Once parties have made a collective bargaining contract the enforcement of that contract should be left to the usual processes of the law and not to the National Labor Relations Board.\" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 42. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 453]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBoth the Senate and the House took pains to provide for \"the usual processes of the law\" by provisions which were the substantial equivalent of 301 (a) in its present form. Both the Senate Report and the House Report indicate a primary concern that unions as well as employees should be bound to collective bargaining contracts. But there was also a broader concern - a concern with a procedure for making such agreements enforceable in the courts by either party. At one point the Senate Report, supra, p. 15, states, \"We feel that the aggrieved party should also have a right of action in the Federal courts. Such a policy is completely in accord with the purpose of the Wagner Act which the Supreme Court declared was `to compel employers to bargain collectively with their employees to the end that an employment contract, binding on both parties, should be made . . . .'\"\n\nCongress was also interested in promoting collective bargaining that ended with agreements not to strike.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 454]\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Senate Report, supra, p. 16 states:\n\n \"If unions can break agreements with relative impunity, then such agreements do not tend to stabilize industrial relations. The execution of an agreement does not by itself promote industrial peace. The chief advantage which an employer can reasonably expect from a collective labor agreement is assurance of uninterrupted operation during the term of the agreement. Without some effective method of assuring freedom from economic warfare for the term of the agreement, there is little reason why an employer would desire to sign such a contract.\n\n\n \"Consequently, to encourage the making of agreements and to promote industrial peace through faithful performance by the parties, collective agreements affecting interstate commerce should be enforceable in the Federal courts. Our amendment would provide for suits by unions as legal entities and against unions as legal entities in the Federal courts in disputes affecting commerce.\"\n\n\n Thus collective bargaining contracts were made \"equally binding and enforceable on both parties.\" Id., p. 15. As stated in the House Report, supra, p. 6, the new provision \"makes labor organizations equally responsible with employers for contract violations and provides for suit by either against the other in the United States district courts.\" To repeat, the Senate Report, supra, p. 17, summed up the philosophy of 301 as follows: \"Statutory recognition of the collective agreement as a valid, binding, and enforceable contract is a logical and necessary step. It will promote a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements, and will thereby promote industrial peace.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPlainly the agreement to arbitrate grievance disputes is the quid pro quo for an agreement not to strike. Viewed in this light, the legislation does more than confer jurisdiction in the federal courts over labor organizations. It expresses a federal policy that federal courts should enforce these agreements on behalf of or against labor organizations and that industrial peace can be best obtained only in that way.\n\nTo be sure, there is a great medley of ideas reflected in the hearings, reports, and debates on this Act. Yet, to repeat, the entire tenor of the history indicates that the agreement to arbitrate grievance disputes was considered as quid pro quo of a no-strike agreement. And when in the House the debate narrowed to the question whether 301 was more than jurisdictional, it became abundantly clear that the purpose of the section was to provide the necessary legal remedies. Section 302 of the House bill,\n5\n the substantial equivalent of the present 301, was being described by Mr. Hartley, the sponsor of the bill in the House:\n\n \"Mr. BARDEN. Mr. Chairman, I take this time for the purpose of asking the Chairman a question, and in asking the question I want it understood that it is intended to make a part of the record that may hereafter be referred to as history of the legislation.\n\n\n \"It is my understanding that section 302, the section dealing with equal responsibility under collective bargaining contracts in strike actions and proceedings \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 456]\n\u00a0\n in district courts contemplates not only the ordinary lawsuits for damages but also such other remedial proceedings, both legal and equitable, as might be appropriate in the circumstances; in other words, proceedings could, for example, be brought by the employers, the labor organizations, or interested individual employees under the Declaratory Judgments Act in order to secure declarations from the Court of legal rights under the contract.\n\n\n \"Mr. HARTLEY. The interpretation the gentleman has just given of that section is absolutely correct.\" 93 Cong. Rec. 3656-3657.\n\n\n It seems, therefore, clear to us that Congress adopted a policy which placed sanctions behind agreements to arbitrate grievance disputes,\n6\n by implication rejecting the common-law rule, discussed in Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109\n, against enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate.\n7\n We would undercut the Act and defeat its policy if we read 301 narrowly as only conferring jurisdiction over labor organizations.\n\nThe question then is, what is the substantive law to be applied in suits under 301 (a)? We conclude that the substantive law to apply in suits under 301 (a) is federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws. See Mendelsohn, Enforceability of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 457]\n\u00a0\n Arbitration Agreements Under Taft-Hartley Section 301, 66 Yale L. J. 167. The Labor Management Relations Act expressly furnishes some substantive law. It points out what the parties may or may not do in certain situations. Other problems will lie in the penumbra of express statutory mandates. Some will lack express statutory sanction but will be solved by looking at the policy of the legislation and fashioning a remedy that will effectuate that policy. The range of judicial inventiveness will be determined by the nature of the problem. See Board of Commissioners v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343, 351\n. Federal interpretation of the federal law will govern, not state law. Cf. Jerome v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 101, 104\n. But state law, if compatible with the purpose of 301, may be resorted to in order to find the rule that will best effectuate the federal policy. See Board of Commissioners v. United States, supra, at 351-352. Any state law applied, however, will be absorbed as federal law and will not be an independent source of private rights.\n\nIt is not uncommon for federal courts to fashion federal law where federal rights are concerned. See Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 363, 366\n-367; National Metropolitan Bank v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 454\n. Congress has indicated by 301 (a) the purpose to follow that course here. There is no constitutional difficulty. Article III, 2, extends the judicial power to cases \"arising under . . . the Laws of the United States . . . .\" The power of Congress to regulate these labor-management controversies under the Commerce Clause is plain. Houston & Texas R. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n; Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1\n. A case or controversy arising under 301 (a) is, therefore, one within the purview of judicial power as defined in Article III.\n\nThe question remains whether jurisdiction to compel arbitration of grievance disputes is withdrawn by the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 458]\n\u00a0\n Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C. 101. Section 7 of that Act prescribes stiff procedural requirements for issuing an injunction in a labor dispute. The kinds of acts which had given rise to abuse of the power to enjoin are listed in 4. The failure to arbitrate was not a part and parcel of the abuses against which the Act was aimed. Section 8 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act does, indeed, indicate a congressional policy toward settlement of labor disputes by arbitration, for it denies injunctive relief to any person who has failed to make \"every reasonable effort\" to settle the dispute by negotiation, mediation, or \"voluntary arbitration.\" Though a literal reading might bring the dispute within the terms of the Act (see Cox, Grievance Arbitration in the Federal Courts, 67 Harv. L. Rev. 591, 602-604), we see no justification in policy for restricting 301 (a) to damage suits, leaving specific performance of a contract to arbitrate grievance disputes to the inapposite\n8\n procedural requirements of that Act. Moreover, we held in Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, and in Graham v. Brotherhood of Firemen, \n338 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not deprive federal courts of jurisdiction to compel compliance with the mandates of the Railway Labor Act. The mandates there involved concerned racial discrimination. Yet those decisions were not based on any peculiarities of the Railway Labor Act. We followed the same course in Syres v. Oil Workers International Union, \n350 \nU.S. 892\n, which was governed by the National Labor Relations Act. There an injunction was sought against racial discrimination in application of a collective bargaining agreement; and we allowed the injunction to issue. The congressional policy in favor of the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 459]\n\u00a0\n grievance disputes being clear,\n9\n there is no reason to submit them to the requirements of 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.\n\nA question of mootness was raised on oral argument. It appears that since the date of the decision in the Court of Appeals respondent has terminated its operations and has contracted to sell its mill properties. All work in the mill ceased in March, 1957. Some of the grievances, however, ask for back pay for increased workloads; and the collective bargaining agreement provides that \"the Board of Arbitration shall have the right to adjust compensation retroactive to the date of the change.\" Insofar as the grievances sought restoration of workloads and job assignments, the case is, of course, moot. But to the extent that they sought a monetary award, the case is a continuing controversy.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union v.

Most agreements provide procedures for settling grievances, generally including some form of arbitration as the last step. Consequently, this clause will operate in most cases, except those involving the negotiation of new contracts.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 17-18 states:\n\n\"Statutory recognition of the collective agreement as a valid, binding, and enforceable contract is a logical and necessary step. It will promote a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements, and will thereby promote industrial peace.\n\n\n\"It has been argued that the result of making collective agreements enforceable against unions would be that they would no longer consent to the inclusion of a no-strike clause in a contract.\n\n\n\"This argument is not supported by the record in the few States which have enacted their own laws in an effort to secure some measure of union responsibility for breaches of contract. Four States - Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, and California - have thus far enacted such laws and, so far as can be learned, no-strike clauses have been continued about as before.\n\n\n\"In any event, it is certainly a point to be bargained over and any union with the status of `representative' under the NLRA which has bargained in good faith with an employer should have no reluctance in including a no-strike clause if it intends to live up to the terms of the contract. The improvement that would result in the stability of industrial relations is, of course, obvious.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Section 302 (a) as it passed the House read as follows:\n\n\"Any action for or proceeding involving a violation of an agreement between an employer and a labor organization or other representative of employees may be brought by either party in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without regard to the amount in controversy, if such agreement affects commerce, or the court otherwise has jurisdiction of the cause.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Assn. of Westinghouse Employees v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., \n348 \nU.S. 437\n, is quite a different case. There the union sued to recover unpaid wages on behalf of some 4,000 employees. The basic question concerned the standing of the union to sue and recover on those individual employment contracts. The question here concerns the right of the union to enforce the agreement to arbitrate which it has made with the employer.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] We do not reach the question, which the Court reserved in Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., supra, p. 125, whether as a matter of federal law executory agreements to arbitrate are enforceable, absent congressional approval.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Judge Magruder in Local 205 v. General Electric Co., 233 F.2d 85, 92.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Whether there are situations in which individual employees may bring suit in an appropriate state or federal court to enforce grievance rights under employment contracts where the collective bargaining agreement provides for arbitration of those grievances is a question we do not reach in this case. Cf. Assn. of Westinghouse Employees v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., \n348 \nU.S. 437, 460\n, 464; Moore v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 630\n; Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 239\n; Transcontinental Air v. Koppal, \n345 \nU.S. 653\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, concurring in the result.\n\nThis suit was brought in a United States District Court under 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 460]\n\u00a0\n 1947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. 185, seeking specific enforcement of the arbitration provisions of a collective-bargaining contract. The District Court had jurisdiction over the action since it involved an obligation running to a union - a union controversy - and not uniquely personal rights of employees sought to be enforced by a union. Cf. Association of Westinghouse Employees v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., \n348 \nU.S. 437\n. Having jurisdiction over the suit, the court was not powerless to fashion an appropriate federal remedy. The power to decree specific performance of a collectively bargained agreement to arbitrate finds its source in 301 itself,\n1\n and in a Federal District Court's inherent equitable powers, nurtured by a congressional policy to encourage and enforce labor arbitration in industries affecting commerce.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nI do not subscribe to the conclusion of the Court that the substantive law to be applied in a suit under 301 is federal law. At the same time, I agree with Judge Magruder in International Brotherhood v. W. L. Mead, Inc., 230 F.2d 576, that some federal rights may necessarily be involved in a 301 case, and hence that the constitutionality of 301 can be upheld as a congressional grant to Federal District Courts of what has been called \"protective jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See the opinion of Judge Wyzanski in Textile Workers Union v. American Thread Co., 113 F. Supp. 137.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See the dissent of Judge Brown in the Court of Appeals in this case, 230 F.2d 81, 89.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court has avoided the difficult problems raised by 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. 185, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 461]\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] by attributing to the section an occult content. This plainly procedural section is transmuted into a mandate to the federal courts to fashion a whole body of substantive federal law appropriate for the complicated and touchy problems raised by collective bargaining. I have set forth in my opinion in Employees v. Westinghouse Corp. the detailed reasons why I believe that 301 cannot be so construed, even if constitutional questions \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 462]\n\u00a0\n cannot be avoided. \n348 \nU.S. 437, 441\n-449, 452-459. But the Court has a \"clear\" and contrary conclusion emerge from the \"somewhat,\" to say the least, \"cloudy and confusing legislative history.\" This is more than can be fairly asked even from the alchemy of construction. Since the Court relies on a few isolated statements in the legislative history which do not support its conclusion, however favoringly read, I have deemed it necessary to set forth in an appendix, post, p. 485, the entire relevant legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act and its predecessor, the Case Bill. This legislative history reinforces the natural meaning of the statute as an exclusively procedural provision, affording, that is, an accessible federal forum for suits on agreements between labor organizations and employers, but not enacting federal law for such suits. See also Wollett and Wellington, Federalism and Breach of the Labor Agreement, 7 Stan. L. Rev. 445.\n\nI have also set forth in my opinion in the Westinghouse case an outline of the vast problems that the Court's present decision creates by bringing into conflict state law and federal law, state courts and federal courts. \n348 \nU.S., at 454\n-455; see also Judge Wyzanski's opinion in Textile Workers Union v. American Thread Co., 113 F. Supp. 137, 140. These problems are not rendered non-existent by disregard of them. It should also be noted that whatever may be a union's ad hoc benefit in a particular case, the meaning of collective bargaining for labor does not remotely derive from reliance on the sanction of litigation in the courts. Restrictions made by legislation like the Clayton Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 738, 20, 22, and the Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 70, upon the use of familiar remedies theretofore available in the federal courts, reflected deep fears of the labor movement of the use of such remedies against labor. But a union, like any other combatant engaged in a particular fight, is ready to make an ally of an old enemy, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 463]\n\u00a0\n and so we also find unions resorting to the otherwise much excoriated labor injunction. Such intermittent yielding to expediency does not change the fact that judicial intervention is ill-suited to the special characteristics of the arbitration process in labor disputes; nor are the conditions for its effective functioning thereby altered.\n\n\"The arbitration is an integral part of the system of self-government. And the system is designed to aid management in its quest for efficiency, to assist union leadership in its participation in the enterprise, and to secure justice for the employees. It is a means of making collective bargaining work and thus preserving private enterprise in a free government. When it works fairly well, it does not need the sanction of the law of contracts or the law of arbitration. It is only when the system breaks down completely that the courts' aid in these respects is invoked. But the courts cannot, by occasional sporadic decision, restore the parties' continuing relationship; and their intervention in such cases may seriously affect the going systems of self-government. When their autonomous system breaks down, might not the parties better be left to the usual methods for adjustment of labor disputes rather than to court actions on the contract or on the arbitration award?\" Shulman, Reason, Contract, and Law in Labor Relations, 68 Harv. L. Rev. 999, 1024.\n\n\n These reflections summarized the vast and extraordinarily successful experience of Dean Harry Shulman as labor arbitrator, especially as umpire under the collective-bargaining contract between the Ford Motor Co. and the UAW-CIO. (See his Opinions of the Umpire, Ford Motor Co. and UAW-CIO, 1943-1946, and the review by E. Merrick Dodd in 60 Harv. L. Rev. 486.) Arbitration agreements are for specific terms, generally much shorter than the time required for adjudication of a contested \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 464]\n\u00a0\n lawsuit through the available stages of trial and appeal. Renegotiation of agreements cannot await the outcome of such litigation; nor can the parties' continuing relation await it. Cases under 301 will probably present unusual rather than representative situations. A \"rule\" derived from them is more likely to discombobulate than to compose. A \"uniform corpus\" cannot be expected to evolve, certainly not within a time to serve its assumed function.\n\nThe prickly and extensive problems that the supposed grant would create further counsel against a finding that the grant was made. They present hazardous opportunities for friction in the regulation of contracts between employers and unions. They involve the division of power between State and Nation, between state courts and federal courts, including the effective functioning of this Court. Wisdom suggests self-restraint in undertaking to solve these problems unless the Court is clearly directed to do so. Section 301 is not such a direction. The legislative history contains no suggestion that these problems were considered; the terms of the section do not present them.\n\nOne word more remains to be said. The earliest declaration of unconstitutionality of an act of Congress - by the Justices on circuit - involved a refusal by the Justices to perform a function imposed upon them by Congress because of the non-judicial nature of that function. Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409. Since then, the Court has many times declared legislation unconstitutional because it imposed on the Court powers or functions that were regarded as outside the scope of the \"judicial power\" lodged in the Court by the Constitution. See, e. g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137; United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40; Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n; Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428\n.\n\nOne may fairly generalize from these instances that the Court has deemed itself peculiarly qualified, with due \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 465]\n\u00a0\n regard to the contrary judgment of Congress, to determine what is meet and fit for the exercise of \"judicial power\" as authorized by the Constitution. Solicitude and respect for the confines of \"judicial power,\" and the difficult problem of marking those confines, apply equally in construing precisely what duties Congress has cast upon the federal courts, especially when, as in this case, the most that can be said in support of finding a congressional desire to impose these \"legislative\" duties on the federal courts is that Congress did not mention the problem in the statute and that, insofar as purpose may be gathered from congressional reports and debates, they leave us in the dark.\n\nThe Court, however, sees no problem of \"judicial power\" in casting upon the federal courts, with no guides except \"judicial inventiveness,\" the task of applying a whole industrial code that is as yet in the bosom of the judiciary. There are severe limits on \"judicial inventiveness\" even for the most imaginative judges. The law is not a \"brooding omnipresence in the sky,\" (Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting, in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205, 222\n), and it cannot be drawn from there like nitrogen from the air. These problems created by the Court's interpretation of 301 cannot \"be solved by resort to the established canons of construction that enable a court to look through awkward or clumsy expression, or language wanting in precision, to the intent of the legislature. For the vice of the statute here lies in the impossibility of ascertaining, by any reasonable test, that the legislature meant one thing rather than another . . . .\" Connally v. General Construction Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385, 394\n. But the Court makes 301 a mountain instead of a molehill and, by giving an example of \"judicial inventiveness,\" it thereby solves all the constitutional problems that would otherwise have to be faced.\n\nEven on the Court's attribution to 301 of a direction to the federal courts to fashion, out of bits and pieces \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 466]\n\u00a0\n elsewhere to be gathered, a federal common law of labor contracts, it still does not follow that Congress has enacted that an agreement to arbitrate industrial differences be specifically enforceable in the federal courts. On the contrary, the body of relevant federal law precludes such enforcement of arbitration clauses in collective-bargaining agreements.\n\nPrior to 1925, the doctrine that executory agreements to arbitrate any kind of dispute would not be specifically enforced still held sway in the federal courts. See, e. g., Judge Hough's opinion in United States Asphalt Refining Co. v. Trinidad Lake Petroleum Co., 222 F. 1006; Judge Mack's opinion in Atlantic Fruit Co. v. Red Cross Line, 276 F. 319; and Mr. Justice Brandeis' opinion in Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109, 123\n, 125. Legislation was deemed necessary to assure such power to the federal courts. In 1925, Congress passed the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq., making executory agreements to arbitrate specifically enforceable in the federal courts, but explicitly excluding \"contracts of employment\" of workers engaged in interstate commerce from its scope. Naturally enough, I find rejection, though not explicit, of the availability of the Federal Arbitration Act to enforce arbitration clauses in collective-bargaining agreements in the silent treatment given that Act by the Court's opinion. If an Act that authorizes the federal courts to enforce arbitration provisions in contracts generally, but specifically denies authority to decree that remedy for \"contracts of employment,\" were available, the Court would hardly spin such power out of the empty darkness of 301. I would make this rejection explicit, recognizing that when Congress passed legislation to enable arbitration agreements to be enforced by the federal courts, it saw fit to exclude this remedy with respect to labor contracts. See Amalgamated Association v. Pennsylvania Greyhound \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 467]\n\u00a0\n Lines, 192 F.2d 310 (C. A. 3d Cir.); United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers v. Miller Metal Products, Inc., 215 F.2d 221 (C. A. 4th Cir.); Lincoln Mills v. Textile Workers Union, 230 F.2d 81 (C. A. 5th Cir.); United Steelworkers of America v. Galland-Henning Mfg. Co., 241 F.2d 323 (C. A. 7th Cir.); and the legislative history set forth by the parties in the present cases. Congress heeded the resistance of organized labor, uncompromisingly led in its hostility to this measure by Andrew Furuseth, president of the International Seamen's Union and most powerful voice expressing labor's fear of the use of this remedy against it.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nEven though the Court glaringly ignores the Arbitration Act, it does at least recognize the common-law rule against enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate. It nevertheless enforces the arbitration clause in the collective-bargaining agreements in these cases. It does so because it finds that Congress \"by implication\" rejected the common-law rule. I would add that the Court, in thus deriving power from the unrevealing words of the Taft-Hartley Act, has also found that Congress \"by implication\" repealed its own statutory exemption of collective-bargaining agreements in the Arbitration Act, an \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 468]\n\u00a0\n exemption made as we have seen for well-defined reasons of policy.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which reached the conclusion that arbitration clauses in collective-bargaining agreements were enforceable under the Arbitration Act, nevertheless found that such clauses would not have been enforceable by virtue of 301:\n\n \"A number of courts have held that 301 itself is a legislative authorization for decrees of specific performance of arbitration agreements. . . . We think that is reading too much into the very general language of 301. The terms and legislative history of 301 sufficiently demonstrate, in our view, that it was not intended either to create any new remedies or to deny applicable existing remedies. See H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 46 (1947); H. R. Rep. No. 510 (Conference Report), 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 42 (1947); 93 Cong. Rec. 3734, 6540 (daily ed. 1947). Arbitration was scarcely mentioned at all in the legislative history. Furthermore, the same practical consideration that militates against judicial overruling of the common law doctrine applies against interpreting 301 to give that effect. The most that could be read into it would be that it authorizes equitable remedies in general, including decrees for specific performance of an arbitration agreement. Lacking are the procedural specifications needed for administration of the power to compel arbitration. . . . Thus it seems to us that a firmer statutory basis than 301 should be found to justify departure from the judicially formulated doctrines with reference to arbitration agreements.\" Local 205 v. General Electric Co., 233 F.2d 85, 96-97.\n\n\n I would put the conclusion even more strongly because, contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the rule that is departed from \"by implication\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 469]\n\u00a0\n had not only been \"judicially formulated\" but had purposefully been congressionally formulated in the Arbitration Act of 1925. And it is being departed from on the tenuous basis of the legislative history of 301, for which the utmost that can be claimed is that insofar as there was any expectation at all, it was only that conventional remedies, including equitable remedies, would be available. But of course, as we have seen, \"equitable remedies\" in the federal courts had traditionally excluded specific performance of arbitration clauses, except as explicitly provided by the 1925 Act. Thus, even assuming that 301 contains directions for some federal substantive law of labor contracts, I see no justification for translating the vague expectation concerning the remedies to be applied into an overruling of previous federal common law and, more particularly, into the repeal of the previous congressional exemption of collective-bargaining agreements from the class of agreements in which arbitration clauses were to be enforced.\n\nThe second ground of my dissent from the Court's action is more fundamental.\n3\n Since I do not agree with the Court's conclusion that federal substantive law is to govern in actions under 301, I am forced to consider the serious constitutional question that was adumbrated in the Westinghouse case, \n348 \nU.S., at 449\n-452, the constitutionality of a grant of jurisdiction to federal courts over contracts that came into being entirely by virtue of state substantive law, a jurisdiction not based on diversity of citizenship, yet one in which a federal court would, as in \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 470]\n\u00a0\n diversity cases, act in effect merely as another court of the State in which it sits. The scope of allowable federal judicial power that this grant must satisfy is constitutionally described as \"Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.\" Art. III, 2. While interpretive decisions are legion under general statutory grants of jurisdiction strikingly similar to this constitutional wording, it is generally recognized that the full constitutional power has not been exhausted by these statutes. See, e. g., Mishkin, The Federal \"Question\" in the District Courts, 53 Col. L. Rev. 157, 160; Shulman and Jaegerman, Some Jurisdictional Limitations on Federal Procedure, 45 Yale L. J. 393, 405, n. 47; Wechsler, Federal Jurisdiction and the Revision of the Judicial Code, 13 Law & Contemp. Prob., 216, 224-225.\n\nAlmost without exception, decisions under the general statutory grants have tested jurisdiction in terms of the presence, as an integral part of plaintiff's cause of action, of an issue calling for interpretation or application of federal law. E. g., Gully v. First National Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 109\n. Although it has sometimes been suggested that the \"cause of action\" must derive from federal law, see American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., \n241 \nU.S. 257, 260\n, it has been found sufficient that some aspect of federal law is essential to plaintiff's success. Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180\n. The litigation-provoking problem has been the degree to which federal law must be in the forefront of the case and not collateral, peripheral or remote.\n\nIn a few exceptional cases, arising under special jurisdictional grants, the criteria by which the prominence of the federal question is measured against constitutional requirements have been found satisfied under circumstances suggesting a variant theory of the nature of these \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 471]\n\u00a0\n requirements. The first, and the leading case in the field, is Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738. There, Chief Justice Marshall sustained federal jurisdiction in a situation - hypothetical in the case before him but presented by the companion case of Bank of the United States v. Planters' Bank, 9 Wheat. 904 - involving suit by a federally incorporated bank upon a contract. Despite the assumption that the cause of action and the interpretation of the contract would be governed by state law, the case was found to \"arise under the laws of the United States\" because the propriety and scope of a federally granted authority to enter into contracts and to litigate might well be challenged. This reasoning was subsequently applied to sustain jurisdiction in actions against federally chartered railroad corporations. Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 1\n. The traditional interpretation of this series of cases is that federal jurisdiction under the \"arising\" clause of the Constitution, though limited to cases involving potential federal questions, has such flexibility that Congress may confer it whenever there exists in the background some federal proposition that might be challenged, despite the remoteness of the likelihood of actual presentation of such a federal question.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe views expressed in Osborn and the Pacific Railroad Removal Cases were severely restricted in constructing general grants of jurisdiction. But the Court later sustained this jurisdictional section of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898:\n\n \"The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction of all controversies at law and in equity, as distinguished from proceedings in bankruptcy, between \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 472]\n\u00a0\n trustees as such and adverse claimants concerning the property acquired or claimed by the trustees, in the same manner and to the same extent only as though bankruptcy proceedings had not been instituted and such controversies had been between the bankrupts and such adverse claimants.\"  23 (a), as amended, 44 Stat. 664.\n\n\n Under this provision the trustee could pursue in a federal court a private cause of action arising under and wholly governed by state law. Schumacher v. Beeler, \n293 \nU.S. 367\n; Williams v. Austrian, \n331 \nU.S. 642\n (Chandler Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 840). To be sure, the cases did not discuss the basis of jurisdiction. It has been suggested that they merely represent an extension of the approach of the Osborn case; the trustee's right to sue might be challenged on obviously federal grounds - absence of bankruptcy or irregularity of the trustee's appointment or of the bankruptcy proceedings. National Mutual Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., \n337 \nU.S. 582, 611\n-613 (Rutledge, J., concurring). So viewed, this type of litigation implicates a potential federal question.\n\nApparently relying on the extent to which the bankruptcy cases involve only remotely a federal question, Mr. Justice Jackson concluded in National Mutual Insurance Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., \n337 \nU.S. 582\n, that Congress may confer jurisdiction on the District Courts as incidental to its powers under Article I. No attempt was made to reconcile this view with the restrictions of Article III; a majority of the Court recognized that Article III defined the bounds of valid jurisdictional legislation and rejected the notion that jurisdictional grants can go outside these limits.\n\nWith this background, many theories have been proposed to sustain the constitutional validity of 301. In Textile Workers Union of America v. American Thread Co., 113 F. Supp. 137, 140, Judge Wyzanski suggested, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 473]\n\u00a0\n among other possibilities, that 301 might be read as containing a direction that controversies affecting interstate commerce should be governed by federal law incorporating state law by reference, and that such controversies would then arise under a valid federal law as required by Article III. Whatever may be said of the assumption regarding the validity of federal jurisdiction under an affirmative declaration by Congress that state law should be applied as federal law by federal courts to contract disputes affecting commerce, we cannot argumentatively legislate for Congress when Congress has failed to legislate. To do so disrespects legislative responsibility and disregards judicial limitations.\n\nAnother theory, relying on Osborn and the bankruptcy cases, has been proposed which would achieve results similar to those attainable under Mr. Justice Jackson's view, but which purports to respect the \"arising\" clause of Article III. See Hart and Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, pp. 744-747; Wechsler, Federal Jurisdiction and the Revision of the Judicial Code, 13 Law & Contemp. Prob. 216, 224-225; International Brotherhood v. W. L. Mead, Inc., 230 F.2d 576. Called \"protective jurisdiction,\" the suggestion is that in any case for which Congress has the constitutional power to prescribe federal rules of decision and thus confer \"true\" federal question jurisdiction, it may, without so doing, enact a jurisdictional statute, which will provide a federal forum for the application of state statute and decisional law. Analysis of the \"protective jurisdiction\" theory might also be attempted in terms of the language of Article III - construing \"laws\" to include jurisdictional statutes where Congress could have legislated substantively in a field. This is but another way of saying that because Congress could have legislated substantively and thereby could give rise to litigation under a statute of the United States, it can provide a federal forum for state-created \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 474]\n\u00a0\n rights although it chose not to adopt state law as federal law or to originate federal rights.\n\nSurely the truly technical restrictions of Article III are not met or respected by a beguiling phrase that the greater power here must necessarily include the lesser. In the compromise of federal and state interests leading to distribution of jealously guarded judicial power in a federal system, see 13 Cornell L. Q. 499, it is obvious that very different considerations apply to cases involving questions of federal law and those turning solely on state law. It may be that the ambiguity of the phrase \"arising under the laws of the United States\" leaves room for more than traditional theory could accommodate. But, under the theory of \"protective jurisdiction,\" the \"arising under\" jurisdiction of the federal courts would be vastly extended. For example, every contract or tort arising out of a contract affecting commerce might be a potential cause of action in the federal courts, even though only state law was involved in the decision of the case. At least in Osborn and the bankruptcy cases, a substantive federal law was present somewhere in the background. See pp. 470-472, supra, and pp. 480-484, infra. But this theory rests on the supposition that Congress could enact substantive federal law to govern the particular case. It was not held in those cases, nor is it clear, that federal law could be held to govern the transactions of all persons who subsequently become bankrupt, or of all suits of a Bank of the United States. See Mishkin, The Federal \"Question\" in the District Courts, 53 Col. L. Rev. 157, 189.\n\n\"Protective jurisdiction,\" once the label is discarded, cannot be justified under any view of the allowable scope to be given to Article III. \"Protective jurisdiction\" is a misused label for the statute we are here considering. That rubric is properly descriptive of safeguarding some of the indisputable, staple business of the federal courts. It is a radiation of an existing jurisdiction. See Adams v. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 475]\n\u00a0\n United States ex rel. McCann, \n317 \nU.S. 269\n; 28 U.S.C. 2283. \"Protective jurisdiction\" cannot generate an independent source for adjudication outside of the Article III sanctions and what Congress has defined. The theory must have as its sole justification a belief in the inadequacy of state tribunals in determining state law. The Constitution reflects such a belief in the specific situation within which the Diversity Clause was confined. The intention to remedy such supposed defects was exhausted in this provision of Article III.\n5\n That this \"protective\" theory was not adopted by Chief Justice Marshall at a time when conditions might have presented more substantial justification strongly suggests its lack of constitutional merit. Moreover, Congress in its consideration of 301 nowhere suggested dissatisfaction with the ability of state courts to administer state law properly. Its concern was to provide access to the federal courts for easier enforcement of state-created rights.\n\n\n Another theory also relies on Osborn and the bankruptcy cases as an implicit recognition of the propriety of the exercise of some sort of \"protective jurisdiction\" by the federal courts. Mishkin, op. cit. supra, 53 Col. L. Rev. 157, 184 et seq. Professor Mishkin tends to view the assertion of such a jurisdiction, in the absence of any \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 476]\n\u00a0\n exercise of substantive powers, as irreconcilable with the \"arising\" clause since the case would then arise only under the jurisdictional statute itself, and he is reluctant to find a constitutional basis for the grant of power outside Article III. Professor Mishkin also notes that the only purpose of such a statute would be to insure impartiality to some litigant, an objection inconsistent with Article III's recognition of \"protective jurisdiction\" only in the specified situation of diverse citizenship. But where Congress has \"an articulated and active federal policy regulating a field, the `arising under' clause of Article III apparently permits the conferring of jurisdiction on the national courts of all cases in the area - including those substantively governed by state law.\" Id., at 192. In such cases, the protection being offered is not to the suitor, as in diversity cases, but to the \"congressional legislative program.\" Thus he supports 301: \"even though the rules governing collective bargaining agreements continue to be state-fashioned, nonetheless the mode of their application and enforcement may play a very substantial part in the labor-management relations of interstate industry and commerce - an area in which the national government has labored long and hard.\" Id., at 196.\n\nInsofar as state law governs the case, Professor Mishkin's theory is quite similar to that advanced by Professors Hart and Wechsler and followed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit: The substantive power of Congress, although not exercised to govern the particular \"case,\" gives \"arising under\" jurisdiction to the federal courts despite governing state law. The second \"protective jurisdiction\" theory has the dubious advantage of limiting incursions on state judicial power to situations in which the State's feelings may have been tempered by early substantive federal invasions.\n\nProfessor Mishkin's theory of \"protective jurisdiction\" may find more constitutional justification if there is not \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 477]\n\u00a0\n merely an \"articulated and active\" congressional policy regulating the labor field but also federal rights existing in the interstices of actions under 301. See Wollett and Wellington, Federalism and Breach of the Labor Agreement, 7 Stan. L. Rev. 445, 475-479. Therefore, before resting on an interpretation of 301 that would compel a declaration of unconstitutionality, we must, as was stated in Westinghouse, defer to the strong presumption - even as to such technical matters as federal jurisdiction - that Congress legislated in accordance with the Constitution. The difficult nature of the problem of construction to be faced if some federal rights are sought was set forth in Westinghouse, where the constitutional questions were involved only in their bearing on the construction of the statute. Now that the constitutional questions themselves must be faced, the nature of the problem bears repeating.\n\nLegislation must, if possible, be given a meaning that will enable it to survive. This rule of constitutional adjudication is normally invoked to narrow what would otherwise be the natural but constitutionally dubious scope of the language. E. g., United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366\n; United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 401\n; United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n. Here the endeavor of some lower courts and of this Court has resulted in adding to the section substantive congressional regulation even though Congress saw fit not to exercise such power or to give the courts any concrete guidance for defining such regulation.\n\nTo be sure, the full scope of a substantive regulation is frequently in dispute and must await authoritative determination by courts. Congress declares its purpose imperfectly or partially, and compatible judicial construction completes it. But in this case we start with a provision that is wholly jurisdictional and as such bristles with constitutional problems under Article III. To avoid \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 478]\n\u00a0\n them, interpolation of substantive regulation has been proposed. From what materials are we to draw a determination that 301 is something other than what it declares itself? Is the Court justified in creating all the difficult problems of choice within a sphere of delicate policy without any direction from Congress and merely for the sake of giving effect to a provision that seems to deal with a different subject? The somewhat Delphic wisdom of Mr. Justice Cardozo, speaking for the whole Court, pulls us here in the opposite direction: \"We think the light is so strong as to flood whatever places in the statute might otherwise be dark. Courts have striven mightily at times to canalize construction along the path of safety. . . . When a statute is reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, they have preferred the meaning that preserves to the meaning that destroys. . . . `But avoidance of a difficulty will not be pressed to the point of disingenuous evasion.' . . . `Here the intention of the Congress is revealed too distinctly to permit us to ignore it because of mere misgivings as to power.'\" Hopkins Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Cleary, \n296 \nU.S. 315, 334\n-335.\n\nAssuming, however, that we would be justified in pouring substantive content into a merely procedural vehicle, what elements of federal law could reasonably be put into the provisions of 301? The suggestion that the section permits the federal courts to work out, without more, a federal code governing collective-bargaining contracts must, for reasons that have already been stated, be rejected. Likewise the suggestion that 301 may be viewed as a congressional authorization to the federal courts to work out a concept of the nature of the collective-bargaining contract, leaving detailed questions of interpretation to state law. See \n348 \nU.S., at 455\n-459.\n\nNor will Congress' objective be furthered by an attempt to limit the grant of a federal forum to certain types of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 479]\n\u00a0\n actions between unions and employers. It would be difficult to find any basis for, or principles of, selection, either in the terms of 301 or in considerations relevant to promotion of stability in labor relations. It is true that a fair reading of 301 in the context of its enactment shows that the suit that Congress primarily contemplated was the suit against a union for strike in violation of contract. From this it might be possible to imply a federal right to bring an action for damages based on such an event. In the interest of mutuality, so close to the heart of Congress, we might in turn find a federal right in the union to sue for a lockout in violation of contract. But neither federal right would be involved in the present cases. Moreover, it bears repetition that Congress chose not to make this the basis of federal law, i. e., it chose not to make such conduct an unfair labor practice.\n\nThere is a point, however, at which the search may be ended with less misgiving regarding the propriety of judicial infusion of substantive provisions into 301. The contribution of federal law might consist in postulating the right of a union, despite its amorphous status as an unincorporated association, to enter into binding collective-bargaining contracts with an employer. The federal courts might also give sanction to this right by refusing to comply with any state law that does not admit that collective bargaining may result in an enforceable contract. It is hard to see what serious federal-state conflicts could arise under this view. At most, a state court might dismiss the action, while a federal court would entertain it. Moreover, such a function of federal law is closely related to the removal of the procedural barriers to suit. Section 301 would be futile if the union's status as a contracting party were not recognized. The statement in 301 (b) that the acts of the agents of the union are to be regarded as binding upon the union may be used in support of this conclusion. This provision, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 480]\n\u00a0\n not confined in its application to suits in the District Court under 301 (a), was primarily directed to responsibility of the union for its agents' actions in authorizing strikes or committing torts. It can be construed, however, as applicable to the formation of a contract. So applied, it would imply that a union must be regarded as contractually bound by the acts of its agents, which in turn presupposes that the union is capable of contract relations.\n\nOf course, the possibility of a State's law being counter to such a limited federal proposition is hypothetical, and to base an assertion of federal law on such a possibility, one never considered by Congress, is an artifice. And were a State ever to adopt a contrary attitude, its reasons for so doing might be such that Congress would not be willing to disregard them. But these difficulties are inherent in any attempt to expand 301 substantively to meet constitutional requirements.\n\nEven if this limited federal \"right\" were read into 301, a serious constitutional question would still be present. It does elevate the situation to one closely analogous to that presented in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738.\n6\n Section 301 would, under this view, imply that a union is to be viewed as a juristic entity for purposes of acquiring contract rights under a collective-bargaining agreement, and that it has the right to enter into such a contract and to sue upon it. This was all that was immediately and expressly involved in the Osborn case, although the historical setting was \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 481]\n\u00a0\n vastly different, and the juristic entity in that case was completely the creature of federal law, one engaged in carrying out essential governmental functions. Most of these special considerations had disappeared, however, at the time and in the circumstances of the decision of the Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 1\n, see p. 471, supra. There is force in the view that regards the latter as a \"sport\" and finds that the Court has so viewed it. See Mishkin, 53 Col. L. Rev., at 160, n. 24, citing Gully v. First National Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 109, 113\n-114 (\"Only recently we said after full consideration that the doctrine of the charter cases was to be treated as exceptional, though within their special field there was no thought to disturb them.\"), and Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co., \n288 \nU.S. 476, 485\n; see also Mr. Justice Holmes, in Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180, 214\n-215 (dissenting opinion). The question is whether we should now so consider it and refuse to apply its holding to the present situation.\n\nI believe that we should not extend the precedents of Osborn and the Pacific Railroad Removal Cases to this case, even though there be some elements of analytical similarity. Osborn, the foundation for the Removal Cases, appears to have been based on premises that today, viewed in the light of the jurisdictional philosophy of Gully v. First National Bank, supra, are subject to criticism. The basic premise was that every case in which a federal question might arise must be capable of being commenced in the federal courts, and when so commenced it might, because jurisdiction must be judged at the outset, be concluded there despite the fact that the federal question was never raised. Marshall's holding was undoubtedly influenced by his fear that the bank might suffer hostile treatment in the state courts that could not be remedied by an appeal on an isolated federal question. There is nothing in Article III that affirmatively supports the view that original jurisdiction over cases involving \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 482]\n\u00a0\n federal questions must extend to every case in which there is the potentiality of appellate jurisdiction. We also have become familiar with removal procedures that could be adapted to alleviate any remaining fears by providing for removal to a federal court whenever a federal question was raised. In view of these developments, we would not be justified in perpetuating a principle that permits assertion of original federal jurisdiction on the remote possibility of presentation of a federal question. Indeed, Congress, by largely withdrawing the jurisdiction that the Pacific Railroad Removal Cases recognized, and this Court, by refusing to perpetuate it under general grants of jurisdiction, see Gully v. First National Bank, supra, have already done much to recognize the changed atmosphere.\n\nAnalysis of the bankruptcy power also reveals a superficial analogy to 301. The trustee enforces a cause of action acquired under state law by the bankrupt. Federal law merely provides for the appointment of the trustee, vests the cause of action in him, and confers jurisdiction on the federal courts. Section 301 similarly takes the rights and liabilities which under state law are vested distributively in the individual members of a union and vests them in the union for purposes of actions in federal courts, wherein the unions are authorized to sue and be sued as an entity. While the authority of the trustee depends on the existence of a bankrupt and on the propriety of the proceedings leading to the trustee's appointment, both of which depend on federal law, there are similar federal propositions that may be essential to an action under 301. Thus, the validity of the contract may in any case be challenged on the ground that the labor organization negotiating it was not the representative of the employees concerned, a question that has been held to be federal, La Crosse Telephone Corp. v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, \n336 \nU.S. 18\n, or on the ground that subsequent change in the representative \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 483]\n\u00a0\n status of the union has affected the continued validity of the agreement. Perhaps also the qualifications imposed on a union's right to utilize the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board, dependent on the filing of non-Communist affidavits required by 9 (h) and the information and reports required by 9 (f) and (g), might be read as restrictions on the right of the union to sue under 301, again providing a federal basis for challenge to the union's authority. Consequently, were the bankruptcy cases to be viewed as dependent solely on the background existence of federal questions, there would be little analytical basis for distinguishing actions under 301. But the bankruptcy decisions may be justified by the scope of the bankruptcy power, which may be deemed to sweep within its scope interests analytically outside the \"federal question\" category, but sufficiently related to the main purpose of bankruptcy to call for comprehensive treatment. See National Mutual Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., \n337 \nU.S. 582, 652\n, n. 3 (concurring in part, dissenting in part). Also, although a particular suit may be brought by a trustee in a district other than the one in which the principal proceedings are pending, if all the suits by the trustee, even though in many federal courts, are regarded as one litigation for the collection and apportionment of the bankrupt's property, a particular suit by the trustee, under state law, to recover a specific piece of property might be analogized to the ancillary or pendent jurisdiction cases in which, in the disposition of a cause of action, federal courts may pass on state grounds for recovery that are joined to federal grounds. See Hurn v. Oursler, \n289 \nU.S. 238\n; Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175\n; but see Mishkin, 53 Col. L. Rev., at 194, n. 161.\n\nIf there is in the phrase \"arising under the laws of the United States\" leeway for expansion of our concepts of jurisdiction, the history of Article III suggests that the area is not great and that it will require the presence of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 484]\n\u00a0\n some substantial federal interest, one of greater weight and dignity than questionable doubt concerning the effectiveness of state procedure. The bankruptcy cases might possibly be viewed as such an expansion. But even so, not merely convenient judicial administration but the whole purpose of the congressional legislative program - conservation and equitable distribution of the bankrupt's estate in carrying out the constitutional power over bankruptcy - required the availability of federal jurisdiction to avoid expense and delay. Nothing pertaining to 301 suggests vesting the federal courts with sweeping power under the Commerce Clause comparable to that vested in the federal courts under the bankruptcy power.\n\nIn the wise distribution of governmental powers, this Court cannot do what a President sometimes does in returning a bill to Congress. We cannot return this provision to Congress and respectfully request that body to face the responsibility placed upon it by the Constitution to define the jurisdiction of the lower courts with some particularity and not to leave these courts at large. Confronted as I am, I regretfully have no choice. For all the reasons elaborated in this dissent, even reading into 301 the limited federal rights consistent with the purposes of that section, I am impelled to the view that it is unconstitutional in cases such as the present ones where it provides the sole basis for exercise of jurisdiction by the federal courts.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 485]\n\u00a0\n\n\n  APPENDIX - LEGISLATIVE HISTORY.\n\n\n I. THE CASE BILL (H. R. 4908, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.).\n\n\n  (The Federal Mediation Act of 1946.)\n\n\nA. \nLegislative history in the House:\n\n1. \nHearings before the Committee on Labor on H. R. 4908, 79th Cong., 1st Sess.:\n\na. H. R. 4908, as considered by committee, provided  for fact-finding boards. It had no provision concerning  suits on collective-bargaining contracts.\n\nb. During these hearings, there was, however, some  concern with breach of such contracts. Despite the  filing of two memoranda detailing the problems of  enforcement of agreements against a union (pp. 89,  96), there was no elucidation of the problem. The  prevalence of violation was noted and the desire to  do something to promote enforceability expressed.  (Pp. 15, 27, 28, 38, 41, 68, 73, 84, 88, 97, 101, 113.)\n\n2. \nThe House Report contained no comment on the problem. (H. R. Rep. No. 1493, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.)\n\n3. \nThe bill, as introduced on the House floor (92 Cong. Rec. 765):\n\n  \"Sec. 10. Binding effect of collective-bargaining  contracts: All collective-bargaining contracts shall  be mutually and equally binding and enforceable  either at law or in equity against each of the parties  thereto, any other law to the contrary notwithstanding.  In the event of a breach of any such contract  or of any agreement contained in such contract  by either party thereto, then, in addition to any  other remedy or remedies existing either in law or  equity, a suit for damages for such breach or for \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 486]\n\u00a0\n  injunctive relief in equity may be maintained by  the other party or parties in any United States district  court having jurisdiction of the parties. If  the defendant against whom action is sought to be  commenced and maintained is a labor organization,  such action may be filed in the United States district  court of any district wherein any officer of such  labor organization resides or may be found.\"\n\n\n4. \nHouse debate:\n\na. General comment on the desirability of mutual enforceability  of contracts: 92 Cong. Rec. 662, 668,  677, 679, 684, 686, 753, 767.\n\nb. Representative Francis Case's only comments were  not pertinent. Id., at 680, 765.\n\nc. Representative Vorys, in offering corrective amendments  to Section 10, stated:\n\n \"We do create, if there is any doubt about its present  existence, an action for damages for breach of  contract against a labor organization or an employer,  which means that either party, the labor  organization or the employer, may have the benefit  of a trial by jury in any such action.\n\n\n \". . . Since we are attempting to create no new  right in the equity side, there is no reason to refer  to the equity side . . . .\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . It will take away any particular benefits  or advantages of one party or the other that now  exist under other laws which keep the obligations  from being equal and mutual; will not give any new  rights by way of injunction to either party but will  specifically provide for an action at law for damages  to enforce any act of violation of the contracts.\"  (Id., at 853.) \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 487]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n d. Representative Thom, opposing Section 10 as an  incursion on States' rights, appears to have been  the only member to have felt that collective bargaining  contracts already were enforceable in state  and federal courts. Id., at 847.\n\n5. \nAs it finally passed the House, Section 10 read:\n\n \"SEC. 10. BINDING EFFECT OF COLLECTIVE-BARGAINING  CONTRACTS. - All collective-bargaining contracts  shall be mutually and equally binding and  enforceable against each of the parties thereto, any  other law to the contrary notwithstanding. In the  event of a breach of any such contract or of any  agreement contained in such contract by either party  thereto, then, in addition to any other remedy or  remedies existing, a suit for damages for such breach  may be maintained by the other party or parties in  any State or United States district court having  jurisdiction of the parties.\"\n\n\nB. \nLegislative history in the Senate:\n\n1. \nHearings before Senate Committee on Education and Labor on S. 1661:\n\na. Hearings were held on a companion bill to the fact-finding  bill on which House hearings were held.  The Case bill had not yet passed the House.\n\nb. As in the House, however, concern was expressed  over a general impression that unions were not  subject to suits for damages for breach of contract  to the same extent as employers. (Pp. 138, 168,  354, 383, 400, 554, 623, 662, 740.) For the first  time, however, oral testimony directed the legislators  to the primary source of the problem. This  testimony, with a supporting memorandum, indicated  that the problem lay in the status of the union \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 488]\n\u00a0\n  as an unincorporated association. This memorandum,  however, also pointed out that in some jurisdictions  the union was viewed as acting as agent  of the individual employees in negotiating the  collective agreement, and thus was not viewed as  having, even in theory, any rights or obligations on  the contract. (P. 411.)\n\n2. \nHearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor on H. R. 4908 (as it had passed the House):\n\na. \"Mr. CASE. Section 10, opening the miscellaneous  provisions of the bill, is very brief, and I would like  to read it because I think it speaks for itself.\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"It almost would seem unnecessary to say that  contracts entered into between two parties call for  mutual obligations and mutual observance. That  is implicit in all contracts, whether expressed or not,  by statutory provisions saying they are equally binding  and enforceable; but because of some interpretations  or some theories that they are not binding  where labor organizations are involved, I thought in  harmony with what the President said here - recognizing  a practical situation for which we have to  find methods not only of peaceful negotiation but  also of insuring that the contracts once made must  be lived up to - we should have a section in the bill  on that subject.\n\n\n \"This section was modified somewhat in the consideration  in the House. Originally I think we had  in a provision authorizing restraining orders, but  that was eliminated . . . with the consent of myself  and others who had been studying the bill, with the  thought that this possibly met the situation by authorizing  a suit for damages for breach of contract. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 489]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT. Mr. Case, there are one or two  minor questions on that. It says:\n\n\n  \"All collective-bargaining contracts shall be . . . enforceable  by a suit in a State or a United States district  court having jurisdiction of the parties.\n\n\n \"Would you intend to give jurisdiction to the  United States district court in purely local collective-bargaining  contracts not dealing with interstate  commerce? Ought not that be limited in some  way?\n\n\n \"Mr. CASE. That may be. There are other  places in the bill where we worked in, first of all,  a declaration of public interest, and my thought  there was that resting on the general welfare clause,  it was clearly within the authority of Congress  where substantial public interest was involved to  take cognizance -\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT . . . I would think that probably  the jurisdiction of the United States court should  be confined to the type of dispute which is interstate  in character and under the jurisdiction of the National  Labor Relations Board.\n\n\n \"Mr. CASE. I certainly would have no objection  to a clarification on that point. . . .\n\n\n \"Of course, the Senator is aware of the fact that  the interpretation of the Supreme Court recently,  on the subject of interstate commerce, has been so  broad that anything which affects interstate commerce,  which is technically interstate commerce has  been ruled to be interstate commerce.\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT. On the other hand, there is  still a field of intrastate commerce. It doesn't destroy  it, although it goes a long way.\n\n\n \"Mr. CASE. As far as I am concerned, I would  be glad to protect that vanishing field of intrastate \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 490]\n\u00a0\n  commerce, and if the Senators wanted to clarify  that I would have no objection.\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT. The other question relating to  that section which occurs to me is the effect of this  `binding and enforceable,' as related to the incorporation  of unions. As I understand it, a collective-bargaining  agreement is already mutually and  equally binding and enforceable. I can't think of  any circumstance where it would not be. But the  problem seems to be a practical problem, in many  States, of successfully suing a union which is not  incorporated. I don't take it that this section  would change the requirements in a State, we will  say, to make every member of the union a party.  It doesn't really meet that particular difficulty,  which seems to be the chief difficulty in enforcing  collective-bargaining agreements.\n\n\n \"Mr. CASE. I think that what this would do  would be to make the officers of a collective-bargaining  agent suable. I do not think it would extend  to individual members of the union, because the  language is that the contract is made `mutually  and equally binding and enforceable against each  of the parties thereto' and under the Wagner Act  the party to the contract is the recognized bargaining  agent.\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT. No; the recognized bargaining  agent is the union, not the officers of the union; it is  the union, and the union is usually an unincorporated  association. The point I was trying to make  is that if you want to sue an unincorporated association  in many States it is almost impossible to get  them into court, because they have requirements  that you have to serve every member, and you can't  reach them, you can't find them in many cases. So \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 491]\n\u00a0\n  the whole thing is delayed, and it is a long and  tedious problem, if it can be done at all. In some  States that is not so. You can sue an unincorporated  association by serving the officers. But we  have before us a bill from Senator Byrd requiring  that unions be incorporated for the purpose of carrying  out, as I see it, the same purpose you have  here, at least partially, and I just wondered whether  this really was effective to meet the actual difficulty  today in enforcing collective-bargaining agreements.\n\n\n \"Mr. CASE. Well, the intent of it is to make it  possible to bring the action against the union in the  common name of the association.\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT. I don't say it doesn't have that  effect, but I don't think it does. I don't think that  `other law to the contrary notwithstanding' would  affect the method by which you had to bring a suit  against an unincorporated association.\n\n\n \"Senator BALL. Would that make it possible to  sue the union as an entity in the Federal court by  simply serving the officers?\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT. I don't think so, unless you said  so. You might conceivably say so.\n\n\n \"Senator BALL. Then the other question is:  Could we, in effect, waive State laws and make the  same provision apply in State courts?\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT. No; I don't think you can.  But this would authorize suit to be brought in the  Federal court and I thought that should be confined  to interstate cases.\n\n\n \"Mr. CASE. Following the procedure probably,  however, of the law of the State in which the action  was brought.\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT. I don't know; that is a complicated  question, as you know, in a Federal court as \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 492]\n\u00a0\n  to when you have to comply with the State law and  when you do not.\n\n\n \"Mr. CASE. The Senator is probably more  familiar than I with what is called the Second Coronado  case. I am not familiar with the details of it,  but as I have read references to it I think there the  Supreme Court held that an injunction could be  obtained against a union as such where the United  States was the party. Now of course, this section  doesn't carry any injunctive procedure; but there,  at least, the Supreme Court seemed to recognize  that a union might be made the object of an action  as an association without reaching the individual  members.\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT. This would carry to a civil injunction  process if it were one generally usable under  laws of equity, I think, when you say it is binding  and enforceable; whatever the equitable remedies  might be in that State, or might be considered proper  by the court, could be used.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Senator SMITH. I would like to ask Mr. Case  one question on section 10. I have difficulty in seeing  how that changes what the situation would be  if it just wasn't in there at all. I don't quite see  why we need to put that in this bill.\n\n\n \"Let me say first that I have not studied this carefully,  so I am raising the question as it comes to me.\n\n\n \"Mr. CASE. The intent primarily was to meet  the technical legal difficulty that at the present time  the union isn't suable or actionable as an association  unless it is incorporated, and to avoid the necessity  of joining all members of the union as parties.\n\n\n \"Senator TAFT. I would suggest if that is your  purpose it ought to say so in so many words. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 493]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"Mr. CASE. I appreciate the Senator's suggestion.\n\n\n \"Senator SMITH. That was my difficulty. It  didn't seem to me it did make that clear, if that is  the intent.\" (Pp. 8-11.)\n\n\n b. The technical, procedural nature of the problem  was also stressed in testimony of some other witnesses.  See pp. 175-179; 198-200; 248-249.\n\nc. Other less discerning discussion: pp. 34, 47, 48, 110,  125, 129, 135, 144, 148, 157, 225, 237, 240, 266, 371,  372, 378, 385, 409.\n\n3. \nSenate Report (No. 1177, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.):\n\na. Majority:\n\n \"Your committee has also considered and rejected  section 10 of H. R. 4908, as passed by the House,  which would explicitly declare that all collective-bargaining  contracts shall be mutually binding and  enforceable by the parties thereto. In the first  place, this proposal appears to be based upon a  misapprehension as to the legal responsibility of the  parties under such contracts. Collective-bargaining  agreements are at present legally enforceable  in the courts, and in the Federal courts, if jurisdiction  is otherwise established according to applicable  law, unions may be sued in their own names under  the doctrine of the first Coronado case (United  Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Company, 259 U.S.  344.). Legally, therefore, the proposed provision  is unnecessary. Practically, it presents serious dangers.  By offering easy access to the courts in cases  where a breach of a collective-bargaining agreement  is alleged, it would act as an inducement to litigate  every alleged grievance, and would result in a flood  of litigation making the courts again the battlefield \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 494]\n\u00a0\n  for industrial disputes, increasing rather than eliminating  the acrimony and conflict between the parties.  In addition, your committee wishes to point  out the fallacy of a widely held notion that breaches  of contract are most often committed by labor  organizations and employees. On the contrary,  most breaches of contract are by employers. As has  been elsewhere stated at greater length in this  report your committee feels that labor disputes  should be settled by conference, negotiation, and  compromise, and not by the use of mandatory  judicial processes. . . .\" (Pp. 8-9.)\n\n\n b. Minority (Senators Ball, Taft, and H. Alexander  Smith):\n\n \"AMENDMENT No. 3 [the minority proposal]  would make unions suable as legal entities in the  Federal courts for violation of contract, with liability  limited to union assets and not enforceable  against individual members or their property. A  subsection would provide that where individual employees  participated in a `wildcat' strike in violation  of contract, not sanctioned or approved by the union,  the union itself would not be liable but such employees  would lose their legal status as employees  under the Wagner Act, leaving the employer free  to discharge them or not. While collective-bargaining  agreements theoretically are legally enforceable  contracts, as a practical matter, because of the many  obstacles to suits against unions imposed by most  States, they are actually binding on only one party,  the employer. The minority believes this provision,  imposing equal responsibility on both parties to such  contracts, is absolutely essential to the stability of  labor relations. The only argument so far advanced  against it is that some employers might embarrass \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 495]\n\u00a0\n  unions by suits for enforcement of contract. This  hardly is a valid ground for continuing to regard  such contracts as one-way arrangements, wherein  one party receives benefits and assumes no binding  obligations whatsoever.\" (Pp. 3-4.)\n\n\n   \"TEXT OF AMENDMENT No. 3\n\n\n \"Amend H. R. 4908 by inserting at the proper  place the following new section:\n\n\n  \"SEC. - . (a) Suits for violation of a contract concluded  as the result of collective bargaining between an employer  and a labor organization if such contract affects commerce  as defined in this Act may be brought in any district court  of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties.\n\n\n  \"(b) Any labor organization whose activities affect commerce  as defined in this Act shall be bound by the acts  of its duly authorized agents acting within the scope of  their authority from the said labor organization and may  sue or be sued as an entity and in behalf of the employees  whom it represents in the courts of the United States:  Provided, That any money judgment against such labor  organization shall be enforceable only against the organization  as an entity and against its assets, and shall not be  enforceable against any individual member or his assets.\n\n\n  \"(c) For the purposes of this section district courts  shall be deemed to have jurisdiction of a labor organization  (1) in the district in which such organization maintains its  principal office, or (2) in any district in which its duly  authorized officers or agents are engaged in promoting or  protecting the interests of employee members. The service  of summons, subpena or other legal process upon such  officer or agent shall constitute service upon the labor  organization.\n\n\n  \"(d) Any employee who participates in a strike or  other stoppage of work in violation of an existing  collective-bargaining agreement, if such strike or stoppage is not  ratified or approved by the labor organization party to such  agreement and having exclusive bargaining rights for such  employee, shall lose his status as an employee of the employer \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 496]\n\u00a0\n  party to such agreement for the purposes of sections  8, 9, and 10 of the National Labor Relations Act: Provided,  That such loss of status for such employee shall cease if  and when he is reemployed by such employer.\n\n\n .   .  .   .  .\n\n\n \"The purpose of this amendment is simple: to  make collective-bargaining contracts equally binding  and enforceable on both parties to them. The  courts have held that the purpose of the Wagner  Act was -\n\n\n \"to compel employers to bargain collectively with their  employees to the end that an employment contract, binding  on both parties, should be made. (H. J. Heinz & Co.,  \n311 \nU.S. 514\n - 1941.)\n\n\n \"But neither the Wagner Act nor any other Federal  statute makes labor unions legally responsible for  carrying out their agreements.\n\n\n \"The laws of many States make it difficult to sue  effectively and to recover a judgment against an  unincorporated labor union. It is difficult to reach  the funds of a union to satisfy a judgment against it.  In some States it is necessary to serve all the members  before an action can be maintained against the  union. This is an almost impossible process (see  testimony of Raymond S. Smethurst before committee,  February 25, 1946). Despite these practical  difficulties in the collection of a judgment against a  union, the National Labor Relations Board has held  it an unfair labor practice for an employer to insist  that a union incorporate or post a bond to establish  some sort of legal responsibility under a collective  agreement.\n\n\n \"President Truman, in opening the management-labor  conference in November 1945, took cognizance  of this condition. He said very plainly that collective \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 497]\n\u00a0\n  agreements should be mutually binding on both  parties to the contract:\n\n\n  \"We shall have to find methods not only of peaceful  negotiation of labor contracts, but also of insuring industrial  peace for the lifetime of such contracts. Contracts  once made must be lived up to and should be changed  only in the manner agreed upon by the parties. If we  expect confidence in agreements made, there must be  responsibility and integrity on both sides in carrying them  out.\n\n\n \"If unions can break agreements with relative  impunity, then such agreements do not tend to  stabilize industrial relations. The execution of an  agreement does not by itself promote industrial  peace. The main reason for an employer to sign  a collective labor agreement is to assure uninterrupted  operation during the term of the agreement.  Without some effective method of assuring freedom  from economic warfare for the term of the agreement,  there is little reason why an employer would  desire to enter into an agreement.\n\n\n \"Consequently, to encourage the making of agreements  and to promote industrial peace through  faithful performance by the parties, collective agreements  dealing with interstate commerce should be  enforceable in the Federal courts. Our amendment  would provide for suits by unions as legal entities  and against unions as legal entities in the Federal  courts in disputes affecting commerce (as defined by  sec. 2 (a) (1) of this act).\n\n\n \"The amendment specifically provides that only  the assets of the union can be attached to satisfy  a money judgment against it. The property of the  individual members of the organization would become  absolutely free from any liability under such a  judgment. Thus the members of the union would \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 498]\n\u00a0\n  secure all the advantages of limited liability without  incorporation of the union.\n\n\n \"The proposed amendment relative to union liability  specifically provides that a labor organization  would be bound by the acts of its authorized agents  only. Thus a labor organization would not be liable  for damages arising as a result of an unauthorized  strike carried on in violation of a contract. If  a union or an officer thereof did not authorize the  strike or participate in it, or support it, or subsequently  approve it, no liability would be imposed  on the union as a consequence of the work stoppage.  To protect the employer against work stoppages in  violation of an agreement but not approved by the  union, employees who take part in such strikes  would lose their status as employees under sections  8, 9, and 10 of the National Labor Relations Act.  The employer could refuse to rehire them after the  strike. Besides providing a remedy for the employer  for irresponsible interruptions of production,  such a provision would tend to strengthen sound  union discipline.\n\n\n \"The initial obstacle in enforcing the terms of a  collective agreement against a union which has  breached its provisions is the difficulty of subjecting  the union to process. The great majority of labor  unions are unincorporated associations and at common  law voluntary associations are not suable as  such (Wilson v. Airline Coal Company, 215 Iowa  855; Iron Molders' Union v. Allis-Chalmers Company,  C. C. A. 7, 166 F. 45). As a consequence the  rule in all jurisdictions, in the absence of statute, is  that unincorporated labor unions cannot be sued in  their common name (Grant v. Carpenters' District  Council, 322 Pa. St. 62). Accordingly, the difficulty  or impossibility of enforcing the terms of a collective \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 499]\n\u00a0\n  agreement in a suit at law against a union arises  from the fact that each individual member of the  union must be named and made a party to the suit.\n\n\n \"Some States have enacted statutes which subject  unincorporated associations to the jurisdiction  of law courts. These statutes are by no means uniform;  some pertain to fraternal societies, welfare  organizations, associations doing business, etc., and  in some States the courts have excluded labor unions  from their application.\n\n\n \"On the other hand, some States, including California  and Montana, have construed statutes permitting  common name suits against associations  doing business to apply to labor unions (Armstrong  v. Superior Court, 173 Cal. 341; Vance v. McGinley,  39 Mont. 46). Similarly, but more restrictive,  in a considerable number of States the action is  permitted against the union or representatives in  proceedings in which the plaintiff could have maintained  such an action against all the associates.  Such States include Alabama, California, Connecticut,  Delaware, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New  Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina,  and Vermont.\n\n\n \"In at least one jurisdiction, the District of Columbia,  the liberal view is held that unincorporated  labor unions may be sued as legal entities, even in  the absence of statute (Busby v. Elec. Util. Emp.  Union, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia, No. 8548, January 22, 1945).\n\n\n \"In the Federal Courts, whether an unincorporated  union can be sued depends upon the procedural  rules of the State in which the action is  brought (Busby v. Elec. Util. Empl. Union  [\n323 \nU.S. 72\n], U.S. Supreme Court, 89 Law. Adv. Op.  108, December 4, 1944). \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 500]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"The Norris-LaGuardia Act has insulated labor  unions, in the field of injunctions, against liability  for breach of contract. It has been held by a Federal  court that strikes, picketing, or boycotting,  when carried on in breach of a collective agreement,  involve a `labor dispute' under the act so as to make  the activity not enjoyable [sic] without a showing  of the requirements which condition the issuance  of an injunction under the act (Wilson & Co. v.  [Birl,] 105 F.2d 948, C. C. A. 3).\n\n\n \"A great number of States have enacted anti-injunction  statutes modeled after the Norris-LaGuardia  Act, and the courts of many of these  jurisdictions have held that a strike in violation of  a collective agreement is a `labor dispute' and cannot  be enjoined (The Nevins v. Kasmach, 279 N. Y. 323;  Bulkin v. Sacks, 31 Pa. D & C 501).\n\n\n \"There are no Federal laws giving either an employer  or even the Government itself any right of  action against a union for any breach of contract.  Thus there is no `substantive right' to enforce, in  order to make the union suable as such in Federal  courts.\n\n\n \"Even where unions are suable, the union funds  may not be reached for payment of damages and  any judgments or decrees rendered against the association  as an entity may be unenforceable. (See  Aalco Laundry Co. v. Laundry Linen Union, 115  S. W. 2d 89 Mo. App.) However, only where statutes  provide for recognition of the legal status of  associations do association funds become subject to  judgments (Deeney v. Hotel & Apt. Clerks' Union,  134 P.2d 328 (1943), California).\n\n\n \"Financial statutory liability of associations is  provided for by some States, among which are Alabama,  California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 501]\n\u00a0\n  New Jersey, North Dakota, and South Carolina.  Even in these States, however, whether labor unions  are included within the definition of `association' is  a matter of local judicial interpretation.\n\n\n \"It is apparent that until all jurisdictions, and  particularly the Federal Government, authorize  actions against labor unions as legal entities, there  will not be the mutual responsibility necessary  to vitalize collective-bargaining agreements. The  Congress has protected the right of workers to  organize. It has passed laws to encourage and  promote collective bargaining.\n\n\n \"Statutory recognition of the collective agreement  as a valid, binding and enforceable contract is a  logical and necessary step. It will promote a higher  degree of responsibility upon the parties to such  agreements, and will thereby promote industrial  peace.\n\n\n \"It has been argued that the result of making  collective agreements enforceable against unions  would be that they would no longer consent to the  inclusion of a no-strike clause in a contract.\n\n\n \"This argument is not supported by the record  in the few States which have enacted their own laws  in an effort to secure some measure of union responsibility  for breaches of contract. Four States -  Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, and California -  have thus far enacted such laws and, so far as can  be learned, no-strike clauses have been continued  about as before.\n\n\n \"In any event, it is certainly a point to be bargained  over and any union with the status of `representative'  under the NLRA which has bargained in  good faith with an employer should have no reluctance  in including a no-strike clause if it intends to \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 502]\n\u00a0\n  live up to the terms of the contract. The improvement  that would result in the stability of industrial  relations is, of course, obvious.\" (Pp. 10-14.)\n\n\n4. \nSenate debate:\n\na. Senator Taft:\n\n \"Mr. President, this amendment is the third and  last of the amendments which attempt to strengthen  the collective-bargaining process. I do not know  of anything for which there has been greater demand  than recognition that labor unions shall be  responsible on their collective-bargaining contracts  exactly as the employer is responsible. The United  States Supreme Court has said that the purpose of  the Wagner Act was:\n\n\n  \"To compel employers to bargain collectively with their  employees to the end that an employment contract, binding  on both parties, should be made.\n\n\n \"I quote from President Truman's address to the  Management-Labor Conference in November 1945:\n\n\n  \"We shall have to find methods not only of peaceful  negotiation of labor contracts, but also of insuring industrial  peace for the lifetime of such contracts.\n\n\n \"I quote still further from President Truman's  address:\n\n\n  \"Contracts once made must be lived up to and should  be changed only in the manner agreed upon by the parties.  If we expect confidence in agreements made, there must  be responsibility and integrity on both sides in carrying  them out.\n\n\n \"A bill was introduced, as I recall, by the Senator  from Virginia [Mr. BYRD] to require all labor unions  to incorporate. We found that to be awkward, and  we thought it unnecessary. All we provide in the  amendment is that voluntary associations shall in \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 503]\n\u00a0\n  effect be suable as if they were corporations, and  suable in the Federal courts if the contract involves  interstate commerce and therefore involves a Federal  question. As a matter of fact, labor unions in theory  are responsible for their contracts. At times  they have been sued, including actions for tort. In  the Danbury Hatters case it will be remembered a  judgment was obtained, and because it was a voluntary  association, the houses of all the various  members were levied upon and taken in satisfaction  of the judgment. We do not want to perpetuate  such a condition. Therefore, we provide very  simply that a labor union may be sued as if it were  a corporation, and if it is sued, then the funds of  the labor organization and its assets are responsible  for the judgment, but the funds and the assets of  the individual members are not liable on such a  judgment. In other words, we think in subsection  (a) and in subsection (b) we have fairly stated the  proposition.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .   .\n\n\n \"Let me finish discussing subsection (c) first. It  simply provides how labor unions may be sued, how  they may be served, and provides the machinery  by which the suit may be brought. The difficulty  with respect to unincorporated associations is that  under most State laws they are very difficult to sue.  In theory, they are suable, but as a practical matter  there are many States in which it is almost impossible  to sue them. It is necessary to make practically  every member of the labor organization a  party to the suit. Various other kinds of restrictions  and difficulties exist which, as a practical matter,  in a large part of the United States makes it  absolutely impossible to sue a labor union.\" (92  Cong. Rec. 5705.) \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 504]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"What good is a collective-bargaining agreement  if people are not bound by it? If there is a collective-bargaining  agreement and the men are bound  by it, they ought to carry it out. If the union wants  to carry it out, and some of the men say, `We will  not do it,' they ought to be liable. This provision  applies only if the action of the individual is a violation  of the collective-bargaining agreement.\" (Id.,  at 5706.)\n\n\n b. Senator Ball:\n\n \"The pending amendment very simply seeks to  establish for unions the same responsibility for  carrying out their contracts that now apply to  employers. . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. President, it is the contention of some of  the opponents of this amendment that unions are  now suable in State courts. A lawyer on my staff  looked up a number of recent decisions. Several of  them show that in Kentucky, West Virginia, in  Massachusetts, and in Illinois, all of which are important  industrial States, unions cannot be sued as  legal entities. . . .\n\n\n  .   .  .   .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. President, it seems to me that equal responsibility  by both parties to a contract is a principle  which the Senate should apply in the field of labor  relations. I hope the amendment will be adopted.\"  (Id., at 5722.)\n\n\n c. Senator Murray, opposing the measure, argued,  among other things, that labor unions are peculiar  in that they are unincorporated associations, that  state rules regarding them are the same for all \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 505]\n\u00a0\n  unincorporated associations, and that it would be  unjust to subject the union to different rules in the  federal courts. The following quotations, relied  upon by those seeking to find federal substantive  law in Section 301, must be viewed in the context  of this procedural discussion:\n\n \"By their proposal, the minority members of the  committee proposing this amendment would create  a completely new Federal right in the United States  courts. It would not create this new right as  against all unincorporated associations, but it would  set up a new and special court right against unions.\n\n\n \"To realize the full implication of this matter,  it should be remembered that the courts of the  United States, as distinguished from the courts of  each of the several States, operate under a very long-standing  set of laws defining their jurisdiction. It  is not possible to bring each and any case into the  United States courts. . . . The Federal courts were  created solely for the purpose of handling special  matters which are appropriately in the jurisdiction  of a Federal agency. Thus, suits involving rights of  a citizen under Federal statute may go to a Federal  court. Suits involving citizens of more than one  State may go to a Federal court under appropriate  circumstances.\n\n\n \"What is the state of the law today with respect  to the right to bring a suit in a Federal court for  violation of a collective-bargaining agreement?  The law in such a situation is identical with that  affecting all individuals, corporations, or associations.  Where there is diversity of citizenship -  plaintiffs and defendants from different States -  action may be brought in the Federal courts.  Where rights under a Federal statute are involved, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 506]\n\u00a0\n  the matter may be brought to a Federal court. In  short, where, under general law a matter appropriate  for Federal jurisdiction is involved, suits under labor  contracts, as under any other type of contract, may  be brought in the Federal courts.\n\n\n \"The Senators making the present proposal are  not satisfied with this, however. Their proposal  would take labor agreements out of the category  of normal State court operations, and would make  them at all times and under all circumstances a  matter for the Federal courts. The proposal would  create a new and special Federal right to enforce in  the Federal courts the terms in a labor agreement.\"  (Id., at 5708.)\n\n\n \"Continuing my discussion of the amendment, I  wish to say that the first issue is not whether a  collective-bargaining agreement may be enforced in  court. Collective-bargaining agreements are as enforceable  in the courts as any other kind of agreement  under the law today. The first question is  whether collective-bargaining agreements, unlike  any other agreements, are to be thrown into the  Federal courts and made the subject of Federal court  jurisdiction.\" (Id., at 5720.)\n\n\n d. Senator Magnuson, opposing the amendment before  it was actually introduced, went into detailed consideration  of the amendment, which he described  as one to \"create a right of action, under Federal  statute, for breach of a collective-bargaining agreement.\"  He asserted that such agreements were already  fully binding legally on both parties, and that  the difficulty was in the union's status as an unincorporated  association. He defended the necessity  for the restrictive rules regarding suits against such  associations, and emphasized the modification of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 507]\n\u00a0\n  the rule in many states designed to facilitate suits  against unions. Then:\n\n \"The minority views of the Senate Labor Committee  in urging the adoption of the amendment,  correctly assert that the Federal courts must follow  the laws of the States in suits on collective-bargaining  agreements when a Federal statute is not  involved. The minority views however, give an  incorrect picture of the laws of the various States on  the question. At the present time, fully three-fourths  of the States permit suits to be brought  against unincorporated associations in their own  names. In other words, at least three-fourths of  the States allow a suit to be brought against any  employee or any group of employees for the violation  of a collective-bargaining agreement.\n\n\n  . . .  .  .\n\n\n \"The comparative freedom of courts of equity also  make [sic] it possible for them to limit recoveries  to funds or property belonging to the associations  as a condition for permitting this type of suit. Senators,  in view of this progress made by the States,  I see no reason why it is necessary for the Federal  Government to invade the realm of the States to  such an extent as to furnish them laws governing  suits for breaches of purely private contracts. The  law governing private contracts has traditionally  been a matter for State control, and we should not  lightly violate this separation of functions under  the guise of controlling interstate commerce.\n\n\n  .  .  .  . .\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the minority views picture a dark  future for a party who wishes to enforce an agreement  with a labor union. Actually the picture  given is quite misleading. For instance, it says that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 508]\n\u00a0\n  an employer or even the Government has no Federal  right of action to enforce a collective bargaining  agreement.\n\n\n \"Of course, the amendment of the Senator from  Minnesota would allow a Federal right of action to  enforce a collective-bargaining agreement. All of  us who are lawyers know that a party who enters  into an ordinary private contract has practically  no Federal right of action to have the contract  enforced.\n\n\n  . .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . Under the amendment of the Senator from  Minnesota a contract would be enforceable only in  Federal courts, and would, therefore, violate a long-time  cardinal principle of law, namely, that all  contracts are enforceable, if at all, in State courts.\n\n\n  .  .   .  .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. President, there is another point regarding  the pending amendment which I should like to  mention. The amendment under discussion is designed  to make it easier for employers to bring suit  against labor unions. Do the Members of the Senate  realize that it is almost impossible for a labor  union to sue an employer for breach of contract?  Collective-bargaining agreements are generally construed  either as contracts between the employer and  the employees or contracts for the benefit of the  employees. In either case injured employees must  usually sue for themselves. A union may not bring  suit because it has no interest in the matter. Furthermore,  even though its disability to sue as an  unincorporated association has now largely been removed,  it still has the same difficulties bringing suit  as an employer does in bringing it into court as a  defendant. If the Senate is going to confer special \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 509]\n\u00a0\n  privileges on one side, it probably should also adopt  an amendment which would confer the same privileges  on the other side.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. BALL. . . . The Senator is complaining  that unions have difficulty in suing employers for  violations of contract. This amendment would cure  that situation.\n\n\n \"Mr. MAGNUSON. I do not so understand it.  Perhaps I have not read the amendment too carefully,  or perhaps the language has been changed.\n\n\n \"Mr. BALL. The language of the amendment is  `may sue or be sued.'\" (Id., at 5412-5415.)\n\n\n e. Senator Magnuson's belief that the section was  intended to exclude State court jurisdiction was disposed  of later by Senator Ferguson, answering Senator  Murray's similar assumption. (Id., at 5708.)  These incorrect assumptions by Senator Magnuson  do much to explain his belief that a federal \"right  of action\" was granted by 10. Moreover, his  discourse occurred prior to Senator Taft's explanation  of the purpose of the amendment.\n\n5. \nSenator Taft's amendment was incorporated in the bill by the Senate without substantial alteration. 92 Cong. Rec. 5723. See I., D., infra, p. 511.\n\nC. \nHouse debates:\n\n1. \nThe House accepted the Senate version of 10 without requesting a conference.\n\n2. \nRepresentative Case:\n\n \"All this section on stability does is to carry out  the same purpose we had in the House bill, when  we provided for making contracts actually binding \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 510]\n\u00a0\n  upon both parties to it. It has been found that  while a few States permit suing on a labor contract,  many States do not. Unless you have some such  provision as this in Federal law, collective-bargaining  contracts will not be good, in the words of the  President, `for the lifetime of such contracts.'\n\n\n \"So the Senate very carefully and properly drafted  this provision in the way they did, to insure that  `contracts,' again in the words of President Truman,  `once made must be lived up to' and `changed only  in the manner agreed upon by the parties.'\n\n\n \"Individual members of a union are not made  liable for any money judgment, I might point out,  but only the union as an entity. . . .\" (92 Cong.  Rec. 5930-5931.)\n\n\n3. \nRepresentative Slaughter:\n\n \"The second point in the bill provides for mutuality  of contracts.

It provided:\n\n  \"EQUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY\n\n\n \"SEC. 305.

Discussion of the problem of contract responsibility  was frequent, but almost exclusively in general  terms of the existence of a problem and the desirability  of having collective agreements enforceable  against the union as well as the employer. See pp.  4, 34-36, 90-91, 125, 135, 227, 229, 406, 533, 547,  558-559, 569-570, 582, 590-591, 593, 673, 1007-1008,  1074, 1088, 1218, 1804, 1891, 2292, 2345, 2368,  2530, 2532, 2631, 2695.\n\nc. The only considered analysis of the problem, and  the remedy proposed, occurred in the testimony of  Secretary of Labor Schwellenbach:\n\n  \"SUITS BY AND AGAINST LABOR ORGANIZATIONS\n\n\n \"H. R. 267, section 305 of H. R. 725, section 4 of  H. R. 1430, and section 2 of H. J. Res. 43, refer to  suits by and against labor organizations.\n\n\n \"Few subjects are so widely discussed and so little  understood as this one. I agree that labor unions  should be subject to suit. The general idea seems  to be that labor unions are not subject to suit because  they are labor unions. Such a concept has  no basis in law.\n\n\n \"In some States labor unions are not suable in  their common names because they are unincorporated  associations.\n\n\n \"As a matter of fact, there are only 13 States  where unincorporated associations cannot be sued  in their common name in an action at law for breach  of contract or tortious conduct. . . . \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 515]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"Since the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, there are 35 States where they can sue  or be sued in the Federal courts.

(a) Any action for or proceeding involving  a violation of an agreement between an  employer and a labor organization or other representative  of employees may be brought by either  party in any district court of the United States  having jurisdiction of the parties, without regard  to the amount in controversy, if such agreement  affects commerce, or the court otherwise has jurisdiction  of the cause.\n\n\n \"(b) Any labor organization whose activities  affect commerce shall be bound by the acts of its  agents, and may sue or be sued as an entity and in  behalf of the employees whom it represents in the  courts of the United States. Any money judgment  against a labor organization in a district court of  the United States shall be enforceable only against  the organization as an entity and against its assets,  and shall not be enforceable against any individual  member or his assets.\n\n\n \"(c) For the purposes of actions and proceedings  by or against labor organizations in the district  courts of the United States, district courts shall be  deemed to have jurisdiction of a labor organization  (1) in the district in which such organization maintains  its principal office, or (2) in any district in  which its duly authorized officers or agents are  engaged in representing or acting for employee  members.\n\n\n \"(d) The service of summons, subpena, or other  legal process of any court of the United States upon  an officer or agent of a labor organization, in his  capacity as such, shall constitute service upon the  labor organization. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 517]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"(e) In actions and proceedings involving violations  of agreements between an employer and a  labor organization or other representative of employees,  the provisions of the Act of March 23, 1932,  entitled `An Act to amend the Judicial Code and to  define and limit the jurisdiction of courts sitting in  equity and for other purposes,' shall not have any  application in respect of either party.\"\n\n\n3. \nHouse Report (No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.):\n\na. Majority:\n\n \"It makes labor organizations equally responsible  with employers for contract violations and provides  for suit by either against the other in the United  States district courts.\" (P. 6.)\n\n\n \"Section 302 deals in improved form with another  subject which was included in last year's Case bill.  It provides that actions and proceedings involving  violations of contracts between employers and labor  organizations may be brought by either party in  any district court of the United States . . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"When labor organizations make contracts with  employers, such organizations should be subject to  the same judicial remedies and processes in respect  of proceedings involving violations of such contracts  as those applicable to all other citizens. Labor  organizations cannot justifiably ask to be treated as  responsible contracting parties unless they are willing  to assume the responsibility of such contracts  to the same extent as the other party must assume  his. Public opinion polls in evidence before the  committee show that nearly 75 percent of the union  members themselves concur in this view. For this  reason, not only does the section, as heretofore \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 518]\n\u00a0\n  pointed out, make the labor organization equally  suable, but it also makes the Norris-LaGuardia  Act inapplicable . . . . Among other things, this  change makes applicable in such cases as these the  rules of evidence that apply in suits involving all  other citizens.\" (Pp. 45-46.)\n\n\n  b. Minority:\n\n \"Section 302 of title III has the dual purpose  first of giving the Federal courts jurisdiction, without  regard to the amount in controversy, to entertain  actions involving violations of collective bargaining  agreements affecting commerce or where the  court otherwise has jurisdiction of the cause; and,  second, of providing for suit against labor organizations  whose activities affect commerce, with judgment  enforceable only against the union assets. In  any such suits the union would be bound by the  acts of its agents and the courts would have  the power to grant injunctive relief regardless of the  provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.\n\n\n \"The question of amenability of unions to suit  has been the subject of much misunderstanding.  Unions have never been exempt from suit because  they are labor unions. It has only been difficult to  reach union assets because unions are unincorporated  associations. And even here, these difficulties  have been removed in the great majority of States.  Actually, there are only 13 States where union funds  cannot be easily reached under laws in effect permitting  satisfaction of judgments from the central  funds of the union. . . . Of the remaining 35  States, there are 10 which by statute permit the  union assets to be reached by representative suits  in any type of action and there are 25 which permit  suits against unions in the common name of the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 519]\n\u00a0\n  union, in some cases with liability attaching not  only to the union funds, but also to the assets of  every individual member of the union.\n\n\n \"This bill would seek to open the Federal courts  generally to suits by and against labor organizations.  Since the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, however, the Federal courts have already  been authorized to entertain suits by and  against labor organizations in the 35 States which  already permit effective recovery against union  funds. Rule 17 (b) of those rules provides in part  as follows:\n\n\n  \". . . The capacity of an individual, other than one acting  in a representative [sic], to sue or be sued shall be  determined by the law of his domicile. . . . In all other  cases capacity to sue or be sued shall be determined by  the law of the State in which the district court is held;  except that a partnership or other unincorporated association,  which has no such capacity by the law of such State,  may sue or be sued in its common name for the purpose of  enforcing for or against it a substantive right existing under  the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n\n\n \"It is concluded, therefore, that there now exists  only a very narrow field for necessary Federal legislative  action. There is perceived very little reason  why the Federal courts should now be opened to so  wide a degree, inviting litigation, when rules presently  in existence effectively permit suit and may,  in the sound discretion of the United States Supreme  Court, be broadened even further to permit  suit regardless of State procedural laws and without  the necessity of further legislation.\n\n\n \"The question of conferring upon Federal courts  broad power to entertain suits for violation of union  agreements regardless of the amount involved and  apparently in complete disregard of the constitutional  requirement of diversity of citizenship is \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 520]\n\u00a0\n  fraught with grave issues of policy and legality. It  would appear particularly unwise to abandon in this  field the present requirement of the $3,000 amount  in controversy as a prerequisite to Federal jurisdiction.  It is feared that the result would be to  involve the Federal courts, already overburdened,  with a great mass of petty litigation over amounts  less than $3,000, easily capable of being adjudicated  effectively by the more numerous State courts.  This type of action would undoubtedly invite the  return of conditions in the Federal Courts during  prohibition days, when they bogged down in litigation  ordinarily handled by the average police court.\n\n\n \"As to legality, the bill would apparently give the  Federal courts jurisdiction of disputes over union  agreements affecting commerce regardless of diversity  of citizenship of the parties. The Constitution  limits suits in the Federal courts to cases arising  under the Constitution and laws of the United  States or involving diversity of citizenship (Constitution,  art. 3, sec. 2). The bill apparently attempts  to found jurisdiction upon the Constitution and  laws of the United States by the use of the words  `if such agreement affects commerce.' There would  be involved here, however, no substantive right  under the laws of the United States or under the  Constitution. Actually substantive legal questions  as to a contract dispute would be decided in accordance  with applicable State law. The United  States Supreme Court has held that the fact that  the circumstances involve engaging in interstate  commerce will not permit the Federal courts to  assume jurisdiction where there is no diversity of  citizenship (In Re Metropolitan Railway Receivership,  \n208 \nU.S. 90, 28\n S. Ct. 219, 52 L. Ed. 403). \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 521]\n\u00a0\n  It is therefore concluded that this aspect of the bill  constitutes an approach which is of doubtful legality  and certainly is both hasty and unwise.\n\n\n \"It is noted that the bill makes an effort to secure  union responsibility for the acts of its agents. Very  general language is used. It is submitted, however,  that, instead, care should be used in determining  what are acts of duly authorized agents acting  within the scope of their authority. . . .\" (Pp.  108-110.)\n\n\n4. \nHouse debates:\n\na. Representative Hartley:\n\n \"It makes labor organizations equally responsible  with employers for contract violations and provides  for suit by either against the other in the United  States district courts.\" (93 Cong. Rec. 3424.)\n\n\n b. Both Mr. Hartley and Mr. Case agreed to the following  statement by Representative Barden:\n\n \"It is my understanding that section 302, the section  dealing with equal responsibility under collective  bargaining contracts in strike actions and  proceedings in district courts contemplates not only  the ordinary lawsuits for damages but also such  other remedial proceedings, both legal and equitable,  as might be appropriate in the circumstances; in  other words, proceedings could, for example, be  brought by the employers, the labor organizations,  or interested individual employees under the Declaratory  Judgments Act in order to secure declarations  from the Court of legal rights under the  contract.\" (Id., at 3656.)\n\n\n c. No other member of the committee made a statement  with regard to the section. Nor did any other \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 522]\n\u00a0\n  member cast any light upon the section. Only  casual references to it appear. (Pp. 3529, 3531,  3666.)\n\n5. \nThe bill passed the House in the same form as introduced.\n\nB. \nLegislative history in the Senate:\n\n1. \nHearings before Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on S. 55 and S. J. Res. 22, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.:\n\na. S. 55, under consideration, was introduced by Senators  Ball, Taft and Smith, and contained as Section  203:\n\n  \"SUITS BY AND AGAINST LABOR ORGANIZATIONS\n\n\n \"SEC. 203. (a) Suits for violation of contracts  concluded as the result of collective bargaining between  an employer and a labor organization representing  employees in an industry affecting commerce  as defined in this Act may be brought in any district  court of the United States having jurisdiction of  the parties.\n\n\n \"(b) Any labor organization which represents  employees in an industry affecting commerce as  defined in this Act shall be bound by the acts of  its duly authorized agents acting within the scope  of their authority from the said labor organization  and may sue or be sued in its common name in the  courts of the United States: Provided, That any  money judgment against such labor organization  shall be enforceable only against the organization  as an entity and against its assets, and shall not \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 523]\n\u00a0\n  be enforceable against any individual member or  his assets.\n\n\n \"(c) For the purposes of this section district  courts shall be deemed to have jurisdiction of a  labor organization (1) in the district in which such  organization maintains its principal office, or (2)  in any district in which its duly authorized officers  or agents are engaged in promoting or protecting  the interests of employee members. The service  of summons, subpena, or other legal process upon  such officer or agent shall constitute service upon  the labor organization.\n\n\n \"(d) Any employee who participates in a strike or  other interference with the performance of an existing  collective-bargaining agreement, in violation of  such agreement, if such strike or interference is not  ratified or approved by the labor organization party  to such agreement and having exclusive bargaining  rights for such employee, shall lose his status as an  employee of the employer party to such agreement  for the purposes of sections 8, 9, and 10 of the  National Labor Relations Act: Provided, That such  loss of status for such employee shall cease if and  when he is reemployed by such employer.\"\n\n\n b. Again, there was considerable general discussion  regarding the necessity for making unions responsible  for their agreements. (Pp. 389, 635, 780, 965,  1227, 1321, 1422, 1493, 1617, 1656, 1817, 2019, 2349,  2371.)\n\nc. The unions, in testimony and filed statements, unanimously  opposed the section. One of the points  constantly made was that the belief that state law  did not regard them as responsible on their contracts  was erroneous. (Pp. 1042, 1154, 1391, 1534, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 524]\n\u00a0\n  1547, 2295.) The procedural nature of the problem  was, however, seldom made explicit. (Pp. 689,  1798, 2011.)\n\nd. Again the most significant testimony occurred when  Secretary of Labor Schwellenbach appeared as a  witness:\n\n \"Secretary SCHWELLENBACH. . . . Suits by  and against labor organizations: This is a subject  upon which there is much discussion and about  which there is very little widespread information.  The general concept is that labor unions are exempt  from suits because they are labor unions. There is  no legal basis for this conclusion. They are exempt  from suits because they are unincorporated associations.  Actually there are only 13 States in the  Union where unincorporated associations are not  subject to suits . . . .\n\n\n \"Since the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, there are 35 States where they can sue  or be sued, in the Federal courts.\n\n\n  .  .  .  . .\n\n\n \"Since the field of necessary legislative action is  so narrow, I see no reason why the gates of the  Federal courts should be opened so wide as to invite  litigation, as is done by this proposed section.  Speaking as a lawyer and former member of the  Federal judiciary, I have an objection to the abandonment  in this field of the requirement of the  $3,000 amount in controversy as a prerequisite to  Federal jurisdiction. This is a right which has been  jealously guarded by the Congress and by the Federal  courts. To have them cluttered up with a great  mass of petty litigation involving amounts less than  $3,000 would bring them back to the position which \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 525]\n\u00a0\n  they occupied during prohibition days when they  became just a little bit above the level of the  average police court insofar as criminal work was  concerned.\n\n\n \"I do not see why it is necessary in this field to  abandon the diversity of citizenship requirement.  In fact I doubt that it can be abandoned constitutionally.  The Constitution, as you know, limits  suits in the Federal courts to cases arising under the  Constitution and the laws of the United States or  involving diversity of citizenship.\n\n\n \"I grappled with the question of what the meaning  of `arising under the laws of the United States'  was a good many times and I make no categorical  statement as to whether or not under this proposal  [sic] legislation the courts would hold that suits so  started would arise under the laws of the United  States. However, the general concept always has  been in private litigation that a necessary prerequisite  to Federal jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship.  In addition to that, care should be used  in determining what are acts of duly authorized  agents operating within the scope of their authority.  To that extent a distinction must be made between  labor unions and other organizations. The question  was fully discussed, studied, and argued by the Congress  at the time of the passage of the Norris-LaGuardia  Act and the language there used limited  the liability of the organization to those `unlawful  acts of individual officers, members or agents,'  where there is `clear proof of actual participation  in or actual authorization of such acts or of ratification  of such acts after actual knowledge thereof.'  With few exceptions I have found that the officers  of international unions were just as anxious to prevent \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 526]\n\u00a0\n  the breaking of contracts as were the employers.  I found that the officers of local unions by and  large were much more anxious to prevent breaking  of contracts than some small groups within the  union. I respectfully suggest that the language of  the Norris-LaGuardia Act should be inserted in the  provision of this section.\n\n\n \"The CHAIRMAN [Senator Taft]. Mr. Secretary,  of course, the basis for the jurisdiction is the  Federal law - in other words, we are saying that all  matters of collective-bargaining contracts shall be  made in certain ways; that both parties shall be  compelled to negotiate them, and they furnish the  solution for the difficulty, which is an interstate  commerce difficulty. I don't quite see why suits  regarding such collective-bargaining contracts, when  made, are not properly the subject of Federal law  arising under the laws of the United States, therefore  subject properly to the jurisdiction of the Federal  courts. I don't understand how we can cover  the whole subject, as we do, in Federal laws, and  then say, when you come down to suing about it,  that the Federal court has no jurisdiction. I don't  understand that.\n\n\n \"Secretary SCHWELLENBACH. I am not contending  that the Federal court should not have  jurisdiction. My two objections are that you should  not clutter up the Federal courts with small suits,  and -\n\n\n \"The CHAIRMAN. I should not think there  would be many suits against unions for violating  collective-bargaining contracts. I think that would  be only a club in a closet. It would be an awkward  suit. Many unions would not have any funds to  collect, and I should think that any suit brought \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 527]\n\u00a0\n  would certainly involve more than $3,000. It  doesn't seem to me that this would bring any great  deluge of litigation upon the Federal courts.\n\n\n \"Secretary SCHWELLENBACH. I am testifying  as a former Federal judge with a desire to protect  the courts from a large volume of small matters.\n\n\n \"Senator ELLENDER. What limitation would  you make?\n\n\n \"Secretary SCHWELLENBACH. You should  have the same requirements for jurisdiction in reference  to these suits, $3,000 the amount in controversy,  and diversity of citizenship. They have got  the right to go into the State courts, you know, in  35 of the 48 States.\n\n\n \"Senator BALL. Aren't there some pretty important  industrial States among those 13, though,  where they cannot go into the State courts, such as  Massachusetts and Virginia, Rhode Island?\n\n\n \"Senator DONNELL. Don't leave out Illinois  and Missouri. [Laughter.]\n\n\n \"Secretary SCHWELLENBACH. I am not going  to get into that one.\n\n\n \"Senator PEPPER. Mr. Secretary, in any of  these 13 States that you have mentioned, where an  unincorporated association is not suable, if those  States were to provide that they are suable, under  the Federal rules they would be suable in the Federal  courts. So in those cases the matter would  be up to the State to determine whether the Federal  courts should have jurisdiction or not, and whether  they would be suable in the State courts or not.\n\n\n \"Secretary SCHWELLENBACH. I am not objecting  to the provision, except I don't like the idea.\n\n\n \"Senator PEPPER. That is the fact, isn't it?\n\n\n \"Secretary SCHWELLENBACH. Yes. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 528]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"Senator PEPPER. Now, in the second place I  get the intimation from your statement that you  made the decision [sic], which I was not quite sure  the chairman recognized or agreed to, namely, that  there was a difference between intrusting a right that  exists under the Federal law or Federal Constitution,  for which there could be redress in the Federal  court, and the attempt of Congress merely to provide  a Federal forum, Federal procedure, for the  determination of the substantive rights which might  be enforced by State law? Isn't that a distinction  that you meant to suggest?\n\n\n \"Secretary SCHWELLENBACH. When I was  on the bench I suppose I tried half a dozen or 10  cases involving the question of whether or not there  was jurisdiction, because they arose under the Federal  statute, and they are tough, very tough, very  hard to distinguish. And I am not making any  categorical statement.\n\n\n \"Senator PEPPER. I mean to suggest this distinction:  If Congress should provide a forum -\n\n\n \"Secretary SCHWELLENBACH. That is what  this proposes to do; provide a Federal forum for  suits against labor.\n\n\n \"Senator PEPPER. For violation of substantive  rights. If Congress were to lay down rules of damages  in cases within congressional jurisdiction - that  is, involving interstate commerce - if Congress were  to lay down the obligations of the parties and prescribe  the rules and measure of damages, and so  forth, for the violation of those obligations, then a  suit for the enforcement of the penalty provided, or  for the redress allowed, might properly be brought  in the Federal courts, but what seems to be the  intention here is to transfer to the Federal courts \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 529]\n\u00a0\n  suits for breach of contract, the contracts being  entered into under local law, and redress in all but  13 States being available now under local law.\"  (Pp. 56-58.)\n\n\n2. \nThe bill as reported:\n\n  \"SUITS BY AND AGAINST LABOR ORGANIZATIONS\n\n\n \"SEC. 301. (a) Suits for violation of contracts  concluded as the result of collective bargaining between  an employer and a labor organization representing  employees in an industry affecting commerce  as defined in this Act may be brought in any  district court of the United States having jurisdiction  of the parties, without respect to the amount  in controversy or without regard to the citizenship  of the parties.\n\n\n \"(b) Any labor organization which represents  employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined  in this Act may sue or be sued in its common  name in the courts of the United States: Provided,  That any money judgment against such labor  organization shall be enforceable only against the  organization as an entity and against its assets, and  shall not be enforceable against any individual  member or his assets.\n\n\n \"(c) For the purposes of this section district  courts shall be deemed to have jurisdiction of a labor  organization (1) in the district in which such organization  maintains its principal office, or (2) in any  district in which its duly authorized officers or  agents are engaged in promoting or protecting the  interests of employee members. The service of  legal process upon such officer or agent shall constitute  service upon the labor organization, and make  such organization a party to the suit.\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 530]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n3. \nSenate Report (No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.):\n\na. Majority:\n\n  \"ENFORCEMENT OF CONTRACT RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\n  \"The committee bill makes collective-bargaining  contracts equally binding and enforceable on both  parties. In the judgment of the committee,  breaches of collective agreement have become so numerous  that it is not sufficient to allow the parties  to invoke the processes of the National Labor Relations  Board when such breaches occur (as the bill  proposes to do in title I). We feel that the aggrieved  party should also have a right of action in  the Federal courts. Such a policy is completely in  accord with the purpose of the Wagner Act which  the Supreme Court declared was `to compel employers  to bargain collectively with their employees to  the end that an employment contract, binding on  both parties, should be made' (H. J. Heinz & Co.,  \n311 \nU.S. 514\n).\n\n\n \"The laws of many States make it difficult to sue  effectively and to recover a judgment against an  unincorporated labor union. It is difficult to reach  the funds of a union to satisfy a judgment against  it. In some States it is necessary to serve all the  members before an action can be maintained against  the union. This is an almost impossible process.  Despite these practical difficulties in the collection  of a judgment against a union, the National Labor  Relations Board has held it an unfair labor practice  for an employer to insist that a union incorporate  or post a bond to establish some sort of legal  responsibility under a collective agreement.\n\n\n \"President Truman, in opening the management-labor  conference in November 1945, took cognizance \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 531]\n\u00a0\n  of this condition. He said very plainly that collective  agreements should be mutually binding on  both parties to the contract:\n\n\n  \"We shall have to find methods not only of peaceful  negotiations of labor contracts, but also of insuring industrial  peace for the lifetime of such contracts. Contracts  once made must be lived up to and should be changed only  in the manner agreed upon by the parties. If we expect  confidence in agreements made, there must be responsibility  and integrity on both sides in carrying them out.\n\n\n \"If unions can break agreements with relative  impunity, then such agreements do not tend to  stabilize industrial relations. The execution of an  agreement does not by itself promote industrial  peace. The chief advantage which an employer can  reasonably expect from a collective labor agreement  is assurance of uninterrupted operation during the  term of the agreement. Without some effective  method of assuring freedom from economic warfare  for the term of the agreement, there is little reason  why an employer would desire to sign such a  contract.\n\n\n \"Consequently, to encourage the making of agreements  and to promote industrial peace through  faithful performance by the parties, collective agreements  affecting interstate commerce should be enforceable  in the Federal courts. Our amendment  would provide for suits by unions as legal entities  and against unions as legal entities in the Federal  courts in disputes affecting commerce.\n\n\n \"The amendment specifically provides that only  the assets of the union can be attached to satisfy a  money judgment against it; the property of the  individual members of the organization would not  be subject to any liability under such a judgment.  Thus the members of the union would secure all \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 532]\n\u00a0\n  the advantages of limited liability without incorporation  of the union.\n\n\n \"The initial obstacle in enforcing the terms of a  collective agreement against a union which has  breached its provisions is the difficulty of subjecting  the union to process. The great majority of labor  unions are unincorporated associations. At common  law voluntary associations are not suable as  such (Wilson v. Airline Coal Company, 215 Iowa  855; Iron Molders' Union v. Allis-Chalmers Company,  C. C. A. 7, 166 F. 45). As a consequence the  rule in most jurisdictions, in the absence of statute,  is that unincorporated labor unions cannot be sued  in their common name (Grant v. Carpenters' District  Council, 322 Pa. St. 62). Accordingly, the  difficulty or impossibility of enforcing the terms of a  collective agreement in a suit at law against a union  arises from the fact that each individual member  of the union must be named and made a party to  the suit.\n\n\n \"Some States have enacted statutes which subject  unincorporated associations to the jurisdiction of  law courts. These statutes are by no means uniform;  some pertain to fraternal societies, welfare  organizations, associations doing business, etc., and  in some States the courts have excluded labor unions  from their application.\n\n\n \"On the other hand, some States, including California  and Montana, have construed statutes permitting  common name suits against associations  doing business to apply to labor unions (Armstrong  v. Superior Court, 173 Calif. 341; Vance v. McGinley,  39 Mont. 46). Similarly, but more restrictive,  in a considerable number of States the action is  permitted against the union or representatives [sic]  in proceedings in which the plaintiff could have \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 533]\n\u00a0\n  maintained such an action against all the  associates. . . .\n\n\n \"In at least one jurisdiction, the District of Columbia,  the liberal view is held that unincorporated  labor unions may be sued as legal entities, even in  the absence of statute (Busby v. Elec. Util. Emp.  Union, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia, No. 8548, Jan. 22, 1945).\n\n\n \"In the Federal courts, whether an unincorporated  union can be sued depends upon the procedural  rules of the State in which the action is  brought (Busby v. Elec. Util. Empl. Union  [\n323 \nU.S. 72\n], U.S. Supreme Court, 89 Law. Adv. Op.  108, Dec. 4, 1944).\n\n\n \"The Norris-LaGuardia Act has insulated labor  unions, in the field of injunctions, against liability  for breach of contract. It has been held by a Federal  court that strikes, picketing, or boycotting,  when carried on in breach of a collective agreement,  involve a `labor dispute' under the act so as to make  the activity not enjoyable [sic] without a showing  of the requirements which condition the issuance  of an injunction under the act (Wilson & Co. v.  [Birl,] 105 F. (2d) 948, C. C. A. 3).\n\n\n \"A great number of States have enacted anti-injunction  statutes modeled after the Norris-LaGuardia  Act, and the courts of many of these jurisdictions  have held that a strike in violation of a  collective agreement is a `labor dispute' and cannot  be enjoined (Nevins v. Kasmach, 279 N. Y. 323;  Bulkin v. Sacks, 31 Pa., D and C 501).\n\n\n \"There are no Federal laws giving either an employer  or even the Government itself any right of  action against a union for any breach of contract.  Thus there is no `substantive right' to enforce, in  order to make the union suable as such in Federal  courts. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 534]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"Even where unions are suable, the union funds  may not be reached for payment of damages and  any judgments or decrees rendered against the association  as an entity may be unenforceable. (See  Aalco Laundry Co. v. Laundry Linen Union, 115  S. W. 2d 89 Mo. App.) However, only where statutes  provide for recognition of the legal status of  associations do association funds become subject to  judgments (Deeney v. Hotel & Apt. Clerks' Union,  134 P.2d 328 (1943), California).\n\n\n \"Financial statutory liability of associations is  provided for by some States, among which are Alabama,  California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,  New Jersey, North Dakota, and South Carolina.  Even in these States, however, whether labor unions  are included within the definition of `association' is  a matter of local judicial interpretation.\n\n\n \"It is apparent that until all jurisdictions, and  particularly the Federal Government, authorize  actions against labor unions as legal entities, there  will not be the mutual responsibility necessary  to vitalize collective-bargaining agreements. The  Congress has protected the right of workers to  organize. It has passed laws to encourage and  promote collective bargaining.\n\n\n \"Statutory recognition of the collective agreement  as a valid, binding, and enforceable contract  is a logical and necessary step. It will promote a  higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to  such agreements, and will thereby promote industrial  peace.\n\n\n \"It has been argued that the result of making collective  agreements enforceable against unions would  be that they would no longer consent to the inclusion  of a no-strike clause in a contract. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 535]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"This argument is not supported by the record  in the few States which have enacted their own laws  in an effort to secure some measure of union responsibility  for breaches of contract. Four States -  Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, and California -  have thus far enacted such laws and, so far as can  be learned, no-strike clauses have been continued  about as before.\n\n\n \"In any event, it is certainly a point to be bargained  over and any union with the status of `representative'  under the NLRA which has bargained  in good faith with an employer should have no  reluctance in including a no-strike clause if it intends  to live up to the terms of the contract. The  improvement that would result in the stability of  industrial relations is, of course, obvious.\" (Pp.  15-18.)\n\n\n \"Section 301 is the only section contained in  [Title III]. It relates to suits by and against labor  organizations for breach of collective bargaining  agreements and should be read in connection with  the provisions of section 8 of title I also dealing  with breach of contracts. The legal effect of this  section has been described at some length in the  main body of the report, supra.\" (P. 30.)\n\n\n b. Minority:\n\n \"Finally, sections 8 (a) (6) and 8 (b) (5) together  with section 301 would give rise to a conflict of  jurisdiction between the National Labor Relations  Board and the United States district courts. This  latter section permits suits in the United States  district courts for violations of collective-bargaining  agreements. Parties to such agreements thus have  the choice of bringing their action before the Board  or the United States district courts. Obviously, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 536]\n\u00a0\n  the necessity for uniform decisions in such matters  and the avoidance of conflicting decisional rules by  judicial bodies make this legislative scheme wholly  undesirable.\n\n\n .   . .   .  .\n\n\n \"(1) Suits for violation of collective-bargaining  agreements\n\n\n \"The Federal courts have always had jurisdiction  to entertain suits for breach of collective-bargaining  contracts and have awarded money damages where  the amount in controversy fulfills the present $3,000  requirement and diversity of citizenship exists.  Nederlandsche Amerikaanische Stoomvart Maatschappij  v. Stevedores and Longshoremen's Benevolent  Society ((1920), 265 Fed. 397). It is apparent  from the language of section 301 that no  change is made in the application of State law for  this purpose. The section states that -\n\n\n \"suits for violation of contracts concluded . . . in an industry  affecting commerce . . . may be brought in any  district court of the United States . . . .\n\n\n \"Every district court would still be required to  look to State substantive law to determine the question  of violation. This section does not, therefore,  create a new cause of action but merely makes the  existing remedy available to more persons by removing  the requirements of amount in controversy  and of diversity of citizenship where interstate commerce  is affected.\n\n\n .  .  .   .  .\n\n\n \". . . the Federal courts would be made an available  tribunal for every petty cause of action between  citizens of the same State, and, undoubtedly  in many instances, residents of the same community, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 537]\n\u00a0\n  with application by the Federal judge of exactly  the same principles of law which would govern the  controversy if it were brought before a State judge  in the more numerous State courts.\n\n\n \"Added to these practical objections, are serious  questions concerning the legality of abandoning the  diversity-of-citizenship requirement. The Constitution  limits suits in the Federal courts, inter alia, to  cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the  United States or involving diversity of citizenship  (Constitution, art. III, sec. 2).\n\n\n \"Reflection upon these practical and legal objections  to this phase of the bill lead to the conclusion  that very little useful purpose would be served by  making Federal courts more broadly available for  the adjudication of disputes under collective-bargaining  agreements. The only advantage, if indeed  it may be called an advantage, is to give many disputing  parties an otherwise unavailable opportunity  to choose a Federal forum rather than a State forum.  The substantive law governing the settlement of the  dispute would not be changed in the least no matter  which forum were chosen. It is our conviction that  the added burdens upon the Federal courts and the  doubtful legality of this measure constitute an  extravagant price to pay for a needless indulgence  benefiting litigants whose remedies are now as adequate  in the State courts as they would be in the  Federal courts.\" (Pp. 13-14.)\n\n\n4. \nSenate debates:\n\na. Senator Taft:\n\n \"Mr. President, title III of the bill, on page 53,  makes unions suable in the Federal courts for violation \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 538]\n\u00a0\n  of contract. As a matter of law unions, of  course, are liable in theory on their contracts today,  but as a practical matter it is difficult to sue them.  They are not incorporated; they have many members;  in some States all the members must be  served; it is difficult to know who is to be served.  But the pending bill provides they can be sued  as if they were corporations and if a judgment is  found against the labor organization, even though it  is an unincorporated association, the liability is on  the labor union and the labor-union funds, and it  is not on the individual members of the union, where  it has fallen in some famous cases to the great financial  distress of the individual members of labor  unions.\" (93 Cong. Rec. 3839.)\n\n\n \"What is the purpose of title III? The purpose  of title III is to give the employer and the employee  the right to go to the Federal courts to bring  a suit to enforce the terms of a collective-bargaining  agreement - exactly the same subject matter which  is contained in titles I and II. It is impossible to  separate them.\" (Id., at 4141.)\n\n\n \"Finally, we have a provision in title III for bringing  a lawsuit for breach of contract. Breach of  what kind of contract? Breach of contract for collective  bargaining.\" (Id., at 4262.)\n\n\n \"The Senator from Oregon, when speaking about  paragraph (5) [ 8 (b) (5)] on page 16, stated  clearly that for the purpose of enforcing the collective-bargaining  agreement we were duplicating the  two remedies, one by lawsuits in court for violation  of an agreement and the other by making the violation  of the agreement an unfair labor practice.  I do not think that is a legitimate objection to such  an amendment.\" (Id., at 4437.) \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 539]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n b. Senator Ball:\n\n \"Fourth, we give to employers the right to sue  a union in interstate commerce, in a Federal court,  for violation of contract. It does not go beyond  that. As a matter of law, I think they have that  right, now, but because unions are voluntary associations,  the common law in a great many States  requires service on every member of the union,  which is very difficult; and, if a judgment is  rendered, it holds every member liable for the  judgment.\n\n\n \"The pending measure, by providing that the  union may sue and be sued as a legal entity, for a violation  of contract, and that liability for damages will  lie against union assets only, will prevent a repetition  of the Danbury Hatters case, in which many  members lost their homes because of a judgment  rendered against the union which also ran against  individual members of the union.\" (Id., at 5014.)\n\n\n c. Senator Smith:\n\n \"I now come to title III, which is very brief, and  merely provides for suits by and against labor organizations,  and requires that labor organizations,  as well as employers, shall be responsible for carrying  out contracts legally entered into as the result  of collective bargaining. That is all title III does.  I cannot conceive of any sound reason why a party  to a contract should not be responsible for the  fulfillment of the contract; it is outside my comprehension  how anyone can take such a position.\n\n\n \"I have heard it argued that it is a terrible thing  to make labor unions responsible for carrying out  their contracts, but I have a quotation here, if I  can find it, from Mr. Justice Brandeis, who was the  greatest friend of labor in the Federal judicial field. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 540]\n\u00a0\n  He said the greatest thing labor could do would be  to recognize its responsibility. This is a quotation  from an address delivered by him before the Economic  Club of Boston on December 4, 1902:\n\n\n  \"The unions should take the position squarely that they  are amenable to law, prepared to take the consequences if  they transgress, and thus show that they are in full sympathy  with the spirit of our people, whose political system  rests upon the proposition that this is a government of  law, and not of men.\n\n\n \"I cannot see how anyone can take issue with so  clear-cut a statement as that, or can take issue with  the provisions of title III, which simply carry out  the idea, by providing that whichever side is guilty  of violating a contract solemnly entered into shall  be responsible for damages resulting from such  violation.\n\n\n  .  .  .   .  .\n\n\n \"All that has been done in title III of the pending  bill is to state, in terms, the very principle that Mr.  Brandeis lays down as a precept to be followed by  unions who desire to be respected in the community.\"  (Id., at 4281-4282.)\n\n\n d. Senator O'Daniel:\n\n \"I believe that labor unions should be made responsible  under the laws with which other citizens  must comply. I do not think anyone is justified in  giving labor unions legal immunity when they  practice coercion, or when they seek to exercise the  secondary boycott, or when they engage in violence,  or when they seek to evade their responsibility for  damages with which they may rightly be charged.  There is no reason on earth why we should allow  labor unions special exemption from laws with  which all other citizens must comply.\" (Id., at  4758.) \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 541]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n e. Senator Murray read, word for word with minor exceptions,  the material contained in the Senate minority  report, quoted above (II. B. 3. b.), which  stressed the fact that Federal courts would be  required to look to state law, and that a serious  constitutional problem would be involved. (Id.,  at 4033.) At a later point, in connection with a  substitute bill proposed by the minority, he said:\n\n \"We of the minority do not see the wisdom of  permitting suits in the Federal courts concerning  the violation of collective-bargaining agreements  regardless of the amount involved or of the constitutional  requirement of diversity of citizenship. It  is clear that the Federal courts are already open to  these suits where the present Federal requirements  are met, and we object to burdening them with a  host of petty litigation not heretofore countenanced  in any way. The State courts are adequate for the  purposes of these petty suits. We have nonetheless  found that there is a present inability of Federal  courts to permit union assets to be reached  easily in the few States where the application of  State procedural laws prevent suits against unincorporated  associations. For this reason section  601 would grant jurisdiction in otherwise justiciable  contract actions where suit is brought by or against  a union in its common name.\" (Id., at 4906.)\n\n\n f. Senator Thomas:\n\n \"Or consider the provisions which open the Federal  courts to damage suits for breach of collective  bargaining agreements. Not content with the unfair  labor practice provisions relative to breaches of  collective-bargaining agreements, the authors of  S. 1126 now propose to give the Government two  bites at the cherry. It must be remembered that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 542]\n\u00a0\n  these provisions do not, in fact, give a remedy where  none previously existed, although some care has  been taken to create the impression that they do.  What these provisions really do is to invite the Federal  district courts to police the parties in their  adherence to their collective-bargaining agreements  by dispensing with the sensible statutory requirement  of a jurisdictional amount of $3,000 and the  constitutional requirement of diversity of citizenship.  I am firmly convinced that this is a vain  effort, because I am sure that the suits contemplated  by these provisions will not be regarded by the  courts as presenting any Federal question. . . .\"  (Id., at 4768.)\n\n\n g. Senator Morse:\n\n \"One procedure is found in the title which permits,  of course, suits by employers against unions  for breach of contract. That is subject to a great  deal of criticism on the part of unions. I do not  think the criticism is well founded, because in my  opinion, when union officials sign a labor contract,  their signature ought to be given the same sanctity  and the same effect as the signature of an employer.  So I am going along with the proposal for legislation  which permits suits for breach of contract against  unions. I think a careful reading by labor leaders  of the particular proposal contained in the bill will  dispel their minds of many of the exaggerated fears  they seem to entertain. But, be that as it may, I  think it is only fair and proper that when unions  damage the property rights of employers or third  parties as the result of breaches of contract, they  should be held responsible for the obligation they  took unto themselves when they signed the contract.\"  (Id., at 4207.) \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 543]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n h. Other references to the section are of little importance  here. (Id., at 3838, 4030, 4148, 4209, 4358,  4986, 5007, and 6454.)\n\n5. \nSection 301 remained unchanged in the bill as it passed the Senate.\n\nC. \nConference Report (H. R. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.):\n\n1. \nThe Conference's revised Section 301 was that presently in force.\n\n2. \nThe Report stated:\n\n  \"SUITS BY AND AGAINST LABOR ORGANIZATIONS\n\n\n \"Section 302 of the House bill and section 301 of  the Senate amendment contained provisions relating  to suits by and against labor organizations in  the courts of the United States. The conference  agreement follows in general the provisions of the  House bill with changes therein hereafter noted.\n\n\n \"Section 302 (a) of the House bill provided that  any action for or proceeding involving a violation of  a contract between an employer and a labor organization  might be brought by either party in any  district court of the United States having jurisdiction  of the parties, without regard to the amount  in controversy, if such contract affected commerce,  or the court otherwise had jurisdiction. Under the  Senate amendment the jurisdictional test was  whether the employer was in an industry affecting  commerce or whether the labor organization represented  employees in such an industry. This test  contained in the Senate amendment is also contained  in the conference agreement, rather than the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 544]\n\u00a0\n  test in the House bill which required that the  `contract affect commerce.'\n\n\n \"Section 302 (b) of the House bill provided that  any labor organization whose activities affected  commerce should be bound by the acts of its agents  and might sue or be sued as an entity in the courts  of the United States. Any money judgment in such  a suit was to be enforceable only against the organization  as an entity and against its assets and not  against any individual member or his assets. The  conference agreement follows these provisions of the  House bill except that this subsection is made  applicable to labor organizations which represent  employees in an industry affecting commerce and to  employers whose activities affect commerce, as later  defined. It is further provided that both the employer  and the labor organization are to be bound  by the acts of their agents. This subsection and the  succeeding subsections of section 301 of the conference  agreement (as was the case in the House  bill and also in the Senate amendment) are general  in their application, as distinguished from subsection  (a).\" (Pp. 65-66.)\n\n\nD. \nDebate on the Conference Report:\n\n1. \nHouse:\n\na. Representative Case:\n\n \"The Taft-Hartley bill incorporates some other  provisions which were in the Case bill of last year  and which are pretty much accepted as proper  subjects of legislation.\n\n\n \"For instance, the bill establishes suability for  and by labor organizations as entities. The bill last  year did that. The objection to suits against labor \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 545]\n\u00a0\n  organizations has stemmed from a proper resentment  against the travesty that took place in the old  Danbury Hatters case where individual members  of a union were harried and their property attached  to satisfy a judgment for action taken by officers  whom they did not control. It was as bad as such  action would be against minority and individual  stockholders of a corporation for acts they could not  control. Both in the bill last year, and in this Taft-Hartley  bill, the language while making labor  organizations responsible under their contracts and  for the acts of their agents, limits judgments to the  assets of the organization itself.\" (93 Cong. Rec.  6283.)\n\n\n2. \nSenate: None.\n\nE. \nVeto Message (H. R. Doc. No. 334, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.):\n\n \"It would discourage the growing willingness of  unions to include `no strike' provisions in bargaining  agreements, since any labor organization  signing such an agreement would expose itself to  suit for contract violation if any of its members  engaged in an unauthorized `wildcat' strike.\"  (P. 3.)\n\n\n \"The bill would invite unions to sue employers  in the courts regarding the thousands of minor  grievances which arise every day over the interpretation  of bargaining agreements. . . .\" (P. 4.)\n\n\n \"At the same time it would expose unions to  suits for acts of violence, wildcat strikes and other  actions, none of which were authorized or ratified  by them. . . .\" (P. 5.) \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 546]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nF. \nSubsequent debate:\n\n1. \nHouse:\n\na. Representative Robsion:\n\n \"For a number of years high, responsible labor  leaders have stated over and over that they believe  in the observance of contracts by both parties. One  of the purposes of organizing and collective bargaining  is to make a contract by management and  the workers. This bill provides that management  and labor each shall fairly and honestly live up to  the terms of their contract and if either party breaks  the contract and the other suffers loss or damage  thereby, the party who is at fault must respond in  fair and just damages. If the parties do not intend  to live up to their contract, why should they take  the time, trouble, and incur expense of making a  contract? . . .\" (93 Cong. Rec. 7491.)\n\n\n2. \nSenate:\n\na. Senator Taft:\n\n \"This is a perfectly reasonable bill in every respect.  If we are to have free collective bargaining  it must be between two responsible parties. Some  of the provisions of this bill deal with the question  of making the unions responsible. There is no  reason in the world why a union should not have  the same responsibility that a corporation has  which is engaged in business. So we have provided  that a union may be sued as if it were a corporation.  . . .\" (Id., at 7537.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [This opinion applies also to No. 276, General Electric Co. v. Local 205, United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers, post, p. 547, and No. 262, Goodall-Sanford, Inc. v. United Textile Workers, post, p. 550.]\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"SEC. 301.

What about those, who shall seek to protect themselves through mutual aid? Some organizations are very strong in their cohesiveness. Cannot those organizations save not only the individuals but themselves?\n\n\n\"The Supreme Court has decided that voluntary organizations may be sued. If they shall enter into an agreement containing an arbitration clause, there can be little doubt that the organization will be bound.\" Proceedings of the 26th Annual Convention of the International Seamen's Union of America, p. 204 (1923).\n\n\n The reference was to this Court's decision, the previous year, in United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In view of the course that this litigation has taken, I put to one side the bearing of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. It is not the first time that unions have conveniently disregarded, when it suited an immediate end, their vehement feelings that secured the restriction upon the federal courts in granting injunctions in labor disputes. Candor compels me to say that I do not think that the conclusion reached by Judge Bailey Aldrich in Local 205 v. General Electric Co., 129 F. Supp. 665, has been persuasively met.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Osborn might possibly be limited on the ground that a federal instrumentality, the Bank of the United States, was involved, see n. 5, infra, but such an explanation could not suffice to narrow the holding in the Pacific Railroad Removal Cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] To be sure, the Court upheld the removal statute for suits or prosecutions commenced in a state court against federal revenue officers on account of any act committed under color of office. Tennessee v. Davis, \n100 \nU.S. 257\n. The Court, however, construed the action of Congress in defining the powers of revenue agents as giving them a substantive defense against prosecution under state law for commission of acts \"warranted by the Federal authority they possess.\" Id., at 263. That put federal law in the forefront as a defense. In any event, the fact that officers of the Federal Government were parties may be considered sufficient to afford access to the federal forum. See In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564, 584\n-586; Mishkin, 53 Col. L. Rev., at 193: \"Without doubt, a federal forum should be available for all suits involving the Government, its agents and instrumentalities, regardless of the source of the substantive rule.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Enunciation of such a requirement could in fact bring federal law somewhat further to the forefront than was true of Osborn, the Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, or the bankruptcy cases in the few cases where an assertion could be made that state law did not sufficiently recognize collective agreements as contracts. But there appears to be no State that today possesses such a rule. Most and probably all cases arising under 301 - certainly the present ones - would never present such a problem.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In No. 276, respondent's motion in the Court of Appeals to amend its complaint to show diversity of citizenship was denied on alternate grounds of possible mootness and Rule 17 (b)'s reference of questions of capacity to sue to state law. The view of 301 that I have set forth would permit that section to be applied constitutionally to situations, such as diversity of citizenship, where there is jurisdiction in the federal courts apart from 301. I would therefore remand this case to permit the amendment alleging diversity of citizenship. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 448, 547]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE STATE OF WYOMING v.

UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 68\nArgued: December 13, 1956Decided: June 17, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In a proceeding instituted in 1950, a lawyer was disbarred by a State Supreme Court in 1954 for forging a promissory note in 1935, when he concededly was suffering from a degree of insanity which resulted in his confinement in an insane asylum for several years thereafter. After release from the asylum, he had practiced law for six years without any charge of misconduct being brought against him. Solely because of his disbarment by the State Court, petitioner subsequently was disbarred by a Federal District Court under a Rule providing for such action \"Whenever . . . any member of its bar has been disbarred . . . from practice . . . in any other court.\" Held: The District Court erred in considering itself conclusively bound by the state-court disbarment, and the case is remanded to the District Court for disposition on the merits under its Rules, in accordance with the standards defined in Selling v. Radford, \n243 \nU.S. 46\n, and in this Court's opinion in this case.

Schillin filed a brief for the Committee on Professional Ethics and Grievances of the Louisiana State Bar Association supporting the United States.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nBecause of petitioner's disbarment by the Supreme Court of Louisiana, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana struck him from its roll of attorneys, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the order. 228 F.2d 617. The case raises an important question regarding disbarment by a federal court on the basis of disbarment by a state court and so we granted certiorari. \n351 \nU.S. 961\n.\n\nA proceeding for disbarment of a lawyer is always painful. The circumstances of this case make it puzzling as well as painful. The facts are few and clear. It is undisputed that petitioner, in 1935, forged a promissory note and collected its proceeds. Criminal prosecution and action for disbarment were duly initiated but both were aborted because the petitioner was \"suffering under an exceedingly abnormal mental condition, some degree of insanity\" at the time of this behavior, to such a degree that he was committed to an insane asylum and was under a decree of interdiction until 1948. Years after, criminal prosecution was unsuccessfully revived, State v. Theard, 212 La. 1022, 34 So.2d 248. The disbarment proceedings, which led to the order in the federal court now under review, got under way in 1950 and the Supreme Court of Louisiana, acting on the findings of a committee of the Louisiana State Bar Association, overruled exceptions to the petition for disbarment. In so doing, the court met the plea of insanity against the claim \n\n[354 \nU.S. 278, 280]\n\u00a0\n of misconduct with the statement that it did not \"view the mental deficiency of a lawyer at the time of his misconduct to be a valid defense to his disbarment.\" Louisiana State Bar Association v. Theard, 222 La. 328, 334, 62 So.2d 501, 503. The next year, \"after issue had been joined,\" the Supreme Court of Louisiana appointed a Commissioner to take evidence and to report to that court his findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Commissioner did so and reported to the Supreme Court this fact that we deem vital to the issue before us: \"It must then, from the record, be held that the respondent was suffering under an exceedingly abnormal mental condition, some degree of insanity.\" 225 La. 98, 104, 105, 72 So.2d 310, 312. The Commissioner deemed himself, however, bound by \"the law of the case\" as announced by the Supreme Court in 222 La. 328, 334, 62 So.2d 501, 503, supra, according to which it was immaterial to disbarment that the petitioner \"was probably suffering from amnesia and other mental deficiencies at the time of his misdeeds.\" Ibid. The Supreme Court of Louisiana in its second decision approved the Commissioner's view about \"the law of the case,\" and added that, were the doctrine otherwise, it would not change its previous ruling. 225 La. 98, 108, 72 So.2d 310, 313.\n\nThe state proceedings thus establish that petitioner was disbarred in 1954 for an action in 1935, although at the time of the fateful conduct he was concededly in a condition of mental irresponsibility so pronounced that for years he was in an insane asylum under judicial restraint. The proceedings also establish that as an active practitioner for six years preceding disbarment, after recovering his capacity, including the argument of thirty-six cases before the Louisiana Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Parish of Orleans, no charge of misconduct or impropriety was brought against him. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 278, 281]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is not for this Court, except within the narrow limits for review open to this Court, as recently canvassed in Konigsberg v. California, \n353 \nU.S. 252\n, and Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232\n, to sit in judgment on Louisiana disbarments, and we are not in any event sitting in review of the Louisiana judgment. While a lawyer is admitted into a federal court by way of a state court, he is not automatically sent out of the federal court by the same route. The two judicial systems of courts, the state judicatures and the federal judiciary, have autonomous control over the conduct of their officers, among whom, in the present context, lawyers are included. The court's control over a lawyer's professional life derives from his relation to the responsibilities of a court. The matter was compendiously put by Mr. Justice Cardozo, while Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. \"`Membership in the bar is a privilege burdened with conditions' (Matter of Rouss, [221 N. Y. 81, 84, 116 N. E. 782, 783]). The appellant was received into that ancient fellowship for something more than private gain. He became an officer of the court, and, like the court itself, an instrument or agency to advance the ends of justice.\" People ex rel. Karlin v. Culkin, 248 N. Y. 465, 470-471, 162 N. E. 487, 489. The power of disbarment is necessary for the protection of the public in order to strip a man of the implied representation by courts that a man who is allowed to hold himself out to practice before them is in \"good standing\" so to do.\n\nThe rules of the various federal courts, more particularly the District Court which disbarred this petitioner, have provisions substantially like the present Rule 8 of this Court dealing with disbarment. \"Where it is shown to the court that any member of its bar has been disbarred from practice in any State, Territory, District, Commonwealth, or Possession, or has been guilty of conduct \n\n[354 \nU.S. 278, 282]\n\u00a0\n unbecoming a member of the bar of this court, he will be forthwith suspended from practice before this court. He will thereupon be afforded the opportunity to show good cause, within forty days, why he should not be disbarred.\" Disbarment being the very serious business that it is, ample opportunity must be afforded to show cause why an accused practitioner should not be disbarred. If the accusation rests on disbarment by a state court, such determination of course brings title deeds of high respect. But it is not conclusively binding on the federal courts. The recognition that must be accorded such a state judgment and the extent of the responsibility that remains in the federal judiciary were authoritatively expounded in Selling v. Radford, \n243 \nU.S. 46\n. The short of it is that disbarment by federal courts does not automatically flow from disbarment by state courts. Of the conditions that qualify such a state court judgment, the one here relevant is that some \"grave reason existed which should convince us that to allow the natural consequences of the judgment to have their effect would conflict with the duty which rests upon us not to disbar except upon the conviction that, under the principles of right and justice, we were constrained so to do.\" Id., at 51.\n\nWe do not think that \"the principles of right and justice\" require a federal court to enforce disbarment of a man eighteen years after he had uttered a forgery when concededly he \"was suffering under an exceedingly abnormal mental condition, some degree of insanity.\" Neither considerations relating to \"the law of the case,\" cf. Messenger v. Anderson, \n225 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, nor the temptation to get bogged down in the quagmire of controversy about the M'Naghten rule, require automatic acceptance by a federal court of the state disbarment in the circumstances of this case. The District Court apparently felt itself \n\n[354 \nU.S. 278, 283]\n\u00a0\n so bound. This we deem error. The case must therefore be remanded to that court for disposition of the motion for disbarment under that court's Rule 1 (f) of its General Rules, in accordance with the standards defined in Selling v. Radford, supra, and this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK concur in the result.\n\nMR.

The union promptly issued a strike call. The railroad sought relief from the Federal District Court, which entered a permanent injunction against the strike.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWe are asked to interpret that provision of the Railway Labor Act\n1\n which created the National Railroad Adjustment Board for the resolution of minor grievances in the event that the parties were unable to settle them by negotiation. The ultimate question is whether a railway labor organization can resort to a strike over matters pending before the Adjustment Board.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 30, 32]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Chicago River and Indiana Railroad Company operates the switching and yard facilities at the Chicago stockyards. A segment of the employees of the River Road were represented by the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. A collective bargaining agreement between the Brotherhood and the River Road was in existence throughout the period covered by this case. The present disagreement arises from an accumulation of twenty-one grievances of members of the Brotherhood against the carrier. Nineteen of these were claims for additional compensation, one was a claim for reinstatement to a higher position, and one was for reinstatement in the employ of the carrier. When negotiations failed, the Brotherhood called a strike. Because of the serious nature of the impending work stoppage, the National Mediation Board proffered its services. The mediator was unsuccessful, and upon his withdrawal, the River Road submitted the controversy to the Adjustment Board. The Brotherhood promptly issued a strike call for four days later.\n\nThe River Road then sought relief from a District Court. Because of the threatened irreparable injury to the carrier, its employees and the 600 industries and 27 railroads served by it, the complaint prayed for a preliminary injunction, and ultimately a permanent injunction, against a strike by the Brotherhood over the grievances pending before the Adjustment Board. A temporary restraining order was issued, but that order was vacated and the complaint dismissed upon the finding by the district judge that the Norris-LaGuardia Act was applicable and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 229 F.2d 926. A permanent injunction \n\n[353 \nU.S. 30, 33]\n\u00a0\n was accordingly entered by the District Court and affirmed by the Seventh Circuit. We granted certiorari in order to resolve an important question concerning interpretation and application of the Railway Labor Act.\n3\n\u00a0\n352 \nU.S. 865\n.\n\nThe grievances for which redress is sought by the Brotherhood are admittedly \"minor disputes\" as that phrase is known in the parlance of the Railway Labor Act. These are controversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining agreement in a particular fact situation, generally involving only one employee. 2, Sixth.\n4\n They may be contrasted with \"major disputes\" which result when there is disagreement in the bargaining process for a new contract. 2, Seventh.\n5\n See Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, \n325 \nU.S. 711, 722\n-724.\n\nThe first step toward settlement of either kind of dispute is negotiation and conference between the parties. Section 3, First (i),\n6\n provides that -\n\n \"The disputes between an employee or group of  employees and a carrier or carriers growing out  of grievances or out of the interpretation or application  of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or  working conditions . . . shall be handled in the  usual manner up to and including the chief operating  officer of the carrier designated to handle such  disputes . . . .\" \n\n[353 \nU.S. 30, 34]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the section continues -\n\n \". . . but, failing to reach an adjustment in this  manner, the disputes may be referred by petition of  the parties or by either party to the appropriate division  of the [National Railroad] Adjustment Board  with a full statement of the facts and all supporting  data bearing upon the disputes.\"\n\n\n Section 3, First (m),\n7\n declares that -\n\n \"The awards of the several divisions of the Adjustment  Board . . . shall be final and binding upon  both parties to the dispute . . . .\"\n\n\n This language is unequivocal. Congress has set up a tribunal to handle minor disputes which have not been resolved by the parties themselves. Awards of this Board are \"final and binding upon both parties.\" And either side may submit the dispute to the Board. The Brotherhood suggests that we read the Act to mean only that an Adjustment Board has been organized and that the parties are free to make use of its procedures if they wish to; but that there is no compulsion on either side to allow the Board to settle a dispute if an alternative remedy, such as resort to economic duress, seems more desirable.\n8\n Such an interpretation would render meaningless those provisions in the Act which allow one side to submit a dispute to the Board, whose decision shall be final and binding on both sides. If the Brotherhood is \n\n[353 \nU.S. 30, 35]\n\u00a0\n correct, the Adjustment Board could act only if the union and the carrier were amenable to its doing so. The language of 3, First, reads otherwise and should be literally applied in the absence of a clear showing of a contrary or qualified intention of Congress.\n\nLegislative history of the provisions creating the National Railroad Adjustment Board reinforces the literal interpretation of the Act. The present law is a composite of two major pieces of legislation. Most of the basic framework was adopted in 1926.\n9\n In 1934, after eight years of experience, the statute was amended, and in that amendment the Adjustment Board was born.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThe distinction between \"major disputes\" and \"minor disputes\" was found in the 1926 statute. Above the level of negotiation and conference, each was to follow a separate procedure. Section 3, First,\n11\n of that Act called upon carriers or groups of carriers and their employees to agree to the formation of boards of adjustment, composed equally of representatives of labor and management, to resolve the \"minor disputes.\" If this step were unsuccessful, these disputes along with the \"major disputes\" became a function of the Board of Mediation, predecessor of the National Mediation Board.\n\nThe obvious lack of any compulsion toward a settlement of disputes was a basic characteristic of the Act and proved to be a major weakness in the procedures for handling \"minor disputes.\" As stated in the Report of the House of Representatives Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, after hearings on the 1934 amendment: \"In many instances . . . the carriers and the employees have been unable to reach agreements to establish such boards [of adjustment].\" H. R. Rep. No. 1944, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 3. This was not the only weakness, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 30, 36]\n\u00a0\n however. \"Many thousands of these [minor] disputes have been considered by boards established under the Railway Labor Act; but the boards have been unable to reach a majority decision, and so the proceedings have been deadlocked.\" Ibid.\n\nThis condition was in marked contrast to the declared purpose of the 1926 Act \". . . to settle all disputes, whether arising out of the application of . . . agreements or otherwise, in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees thereof.\" 2, First.\n12\n The Report continued:\n\n\"These unadjusted disputes have become so numerous that on several occasions the employees have resorted to the issuance of strike ballots and threatened to interrupt interstate commerce in order to secure an adjustment. This has made it necessary for the President of the United States to intervene and establish an emergency board to investigate the controversies. This condition should be corrected in the interest of industrial peace and of uninterrupted transportation service.\" Ibid.\n\n\n The means chosen to correct this situation are the present provisions of 3, First, concerning the National Railroad Adjustment Board. The Board was set up by Congress, making it unnecessary for the parties to agree to establish their own boards.\n13\n In case of a deadlock on the Adjustment Board, which continued the policy of equal representation of labor and management, the appropriate \n\n[353 \nU.S. 30, 37]\n\u00a0\n division is allowed to select a neutral referee to sit with them and break the tie. If the division cannot agree even on a referee, the Act provides that one shall be appointed by the National Mediation Board.\n14\n Thus was the machinery built for the disposition of minor grievances.\n\nThe change was made with the full concurrence of the national railway labor organizations. Commissioner Joseph B. Eastman, Federal Coordinator of Transportation and principal draftsman of the 1934 bill, complimented the unions on conceding the right to strike over \"minor disputes\" in favor of the procedures of the Adjustment Board:\n\n\"The willingness of the employees to agree to such a provision is, in my judgment, a very important concession and one of which full advantage should be taken in the public interest. I regard it as, perhaps, the most important part of the bill.\"\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\n Asked if the Act made it a matter of discretion whether disputes would be submitted to the Adjustment Board, he replied in the negative. It was, he said, a matter of duty -\n\n\". . . and it is my understanding that the employees in the case of these minor grievances - and that is all \n\n[353 \nU.S. 30, 38]\n\u00a0\n that can be dealt with by the adjustment board - are entirely agreeable to those provisions of the law.\n\n\n \"I think that is a very important concession on their part. . . . [T]his law is in effect an agreement on the part of the parties to arbitrate all of these minor disputes.\"\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\n The chief spokesman for the railway labor organizations was George M. Harrison. He appeared as chairman of the legislative committee of the Railway Labor Executives' Association before both the House of Representatives and the Senate Committees. This Association comprised the twenty-one standard railway labor groups, including the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. He testified before the House Committee:\n\n  \"So, out of all of that experience and recognizing  the character of the services given to the people of  this country by our industry and how essential it is to  the welfare of the country, these organizations have  come to the conclusion that in respect to these minor-grievance  cases that grow out of the interpretation  and\/or application of the contracts already made  that they can very well permit those disputes to be  decided, . . . by an adjustment board.\"\n17\n\u00a0\n\n\n Later, before the Senate Committee, he declared:\n\n\"Grievances are instituted against railroad officers' actions, and we are willing to take our chances with this national board because we believe, out of our experience, that the national board is the best and most efficient method of getting a determination of these many controversies that arise on these railroads between the officers and the employees.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  . \n\n[353 \nU.S. 30, 39]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"These railway labor organizations have always opposed compulsory determination of their controversies. . . . [W]e are now ready to concede that we can risk having our grievances go to a board and get them determined, and that is a contribution that these organizations are willing to make.\"\n18\n\u00a0\n\n\n The voice of labor was not unanimous in this concession. The representative of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters vehemently objected to the adoption of 3, First.\n\n  \"We are unalterably opposed to paragraph M, . . .  [which] brings about compulsory arbitration and  prevents the use of the only weapon in the hands of  organized labor. We believe that a very dangerous  precedent would be established with the passage of  this paragraph, and to the best of our knowledge it  is the first time that any such measure has been  enacted by the Congress of the United States.\"\n19\n\u00a0\n\n\n This record is convincing that there was general understanding between both the supporters and the opponents of the 1934 amendment that the provisions dealing with the Adjustment Board were to be considered as compulsory arbitration in this limited field. Our reading of the Act is therefore confirmed, not rebutted, by the legislative history.\n\nThe only question which remains is whether the federal courts can compel compliance with the provisions of the Act to the extent of enjoining a union from striking to defeat the jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board. The Brotherhood contends that the Norris-LaGuardia Act\n20\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 30, 40]\n\u00a0\n has withdrawn the power of federal courts to issue injunctions in labor disputes. That limitation, it is urged, applies with full force to all railway labor disputes as well as labor controversies in other industries.\n\nWe hold that the Norris-LaGuardia Act cannot be read alone in matters dealing with railway labor disputes. There must be an accommodation of that statute and the Railway Labor Act so that the obvious purpose in the enactment of each is preserved. We think that the purposes of these Acts are reconcilable.\n\nIn adopting the Railway Labor Act, Congress endeavored to bring about stable relationships between labor and management in this most important national industry. It found from the experience between 1926 and 1934 that the failure of voluntary machinery to resolve a large number of minor disputes called for a strengthening of the Act to provide an effective agency, in which both sides participated, for the final adjustment of such controversies. Accumulation of these disputes had resulted in the aggregate being serious enough to threaten disruption of transportation. Hence, with the full consent of the brotherhoods, the 1934 amendment became law.\n\nThe Norris-LaGuardia Act, on the other hand, was designed primarily to protect working men in the exercise of organized, economic power, which is vital to collective bargaining. The Act aimed to correct existing abuses of the injunctive remedy in labor disputes. Federal courts had been drawn into the field under the guise either of enforcing federal statutes, principally the Sherman Act, or through diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. In the latter cases, the courts employed principles of federal law frequently at variance with the concepts of labor law in the States where they sat. Congress acted to prevent the injunctions of the federal courts from upsetting the natural interplay of the competing economic forces of labor and capital. Rep. LaGuardia, during the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 30, 41]\n\u00a0\n floor debates on the 1932 Act, recognized that the machinery of the Railway Labor Act channeled these economic forces, in matters dealing with railway labor, into special processes intended to compromise them.\n21\n Such controversies, therefore, are not the same as those in which the injunction strips labor of its primary weapon without substituting any reasonable alternative.\n22\n\u00a0\n\nIn prior cases involving railway labor disputes, this Court has authorized the use of injunctive relief to vindicate the processes of the Railway Labor Act. Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, was an action by the union to enjoin compliance with the Act's provisions for certification of a bargaining representative. The question raised was whether a federal court could issue an injunction in a labor dispute. The Court held:\n\n  \"It suffices to say that the Norris-LaGuardia Act  can affect the present decree only so far as its provisions  are found not to conflict with those of 2,  Ninth, of the Railway Labor Act, authorizing the  relief which has been granted. Such provisions  cannot be rendered nugatory by the earlier and more  general provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.\"  Id., at 563.\n\n\n In Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v.

United States Gypsum Co., \n333 \nU.S. 364\n, reversed dismissal of the Government's suit to restrain violations of the Sherman Act through uniform patent-licensing agreements containing price-fixing provisions, appellees ceased paying royalties to appellant under those agreements; and they made no further payments until after new agreements without price-fixing provisions were entered into following entry in the antitrust suit of a final decree enjoining use of the old agreements. Subsequently, appellant sued appellees for the use of its patents during that period. It asserted three alternative grounds for recovery: (a) the royalty provisions of the old licensing agreements, (b) the reasonable value of the use of its patents, and (c) damages for patent infringement. On petition of appellees, the antitrust court modified its decree in the antitrust case so as to require appellant to dismiss with prejudice its suits against appellees. The court took no evidence beyond that already in the record in the antitrust proceeding, and the record was barren of any facts with respect to the situation existing in the industry since 1941. Held:\n\n 1. By virtue of its reservation of jurisdiction in its antitrust decree to make such \"directions\" and \"modifications\" as may be appropriate to the \"carrying out\" and \"enforcement\" of that decree, the District Court had jurisdiction to grant relief. Pp. 463-464.\n\n\n 2.

The enjoining of appellant's suits for compensation on a quantum meruit basis and for damages for patent infringement was not justified upon the record; and the case is remanded to the District Court for the taking of evidence on the issues of misuse of patents and purge of such misuse as they may relate to the period since February 1, 1948.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nUnited States Gypsum Company appeals from a decree of a three-judge court of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, entered December 9, 1954. This decree modified a final decree of that court, entered May 15, 1951, against Gypsum, the appellees National Gypsum Company and Certain-teed Products Corporation, and others, in a civil antitrust proceeding instituted by the Government in 1940.\n1\n The modification was a provision ordering Gypsum to dismiss with prejudice four suits which it had brought in three different federal district courts against National, Certain-teed, and two other co-defendants in the antitrust proceeding, to recover compensation or damages for the pendente lite use of certain of its patents during the period February 1, 1948, to May 15, 1951.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nAt the outset some mention of the prolonged antitrust proceeding is required to put the present post-decree controversy in context. In that proceeding the Government charged Gypsum, National, Certain-teed, and a number \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n of other corporate and individual defendants with conspiracy to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce in gypsum board and other gypsum products in violation of 1, 2 and 3 of the Sherman Act.\n3\n The crux of the Government's charges was the alleged illegality of Gypsum's system of industry-wide uniform patent licensing agreements containing clauses giving Gypsum the right to fix prices on gypsum board and products. In 1946, at the close of the Government's case, the District Court dismissed the complaint.\n4\n On appeal this Court, on March 8, 1948, reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n5\n Thereafter the District Court, with one dissent,\n6\n interpreting this Court's decision to mean that Gypsum's multiple uniform price fixing patent licenses were illegal per se under the antitrust laws, granted the Government's motion for summary judgment, accepting as true the defendants' proffer of proof. On November 7, 1949, the District Court entered a decree which, among other things, adjudged Gypsum's patent licensing agreements illegal, null and void, enjoined the performance of such agreements, provided for limited compulsory nonexclusive licensing of Gypsum's patents on a reasonable royalty basis, and reserved jurisdiction over the case and parties for certain purposes. On appeals by both the Government and Gypsum, this Court, in 1950, dismissed Gypsum's appeal,\n7\n affirmed the summary judgment below,\n8\n and held the Government entitled to broader relief in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n certain respects, remanding the case for that purpose.\n9\n Meanwhile, in noting probable jurisdiction on the Government's appeal, this Court enjoined the defendants from carrying out the price fixing provisions of their current license agreements, and from entering into any agreements or engaging in concerted action in restraint of trade.\n10\n This preliminary injunction, entered May 29, 1950, remained in force until the new final decree of the District Court was entered on May 15, 1951.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nAfter this Court's 1948 reversal of the District Court's original order of dismissal, National, Certain-teed, and Gypsum's other co-defendant licensees ceased paying royalties under their license agreements.\n12\n Following the May 15, 1951, decree, National and Certain-teed, as authorized by Article VI of that decree, entered into new license agreements, effective May 15, for the future use of Gypsum's patents, such licenses containing no price fixing clauses; the royalty rate was the same as under the old licenses, except that the licensee's returns on unpatented gypsum products did not enter into its measure. The new licenses were without prejudice to Gypsum's claim for compensation for the use of the patents during the period February 1, 1948, to May 15, 1951. The respondents not having paid for that period, Gypsum, in 1953, brought suit against them in the Iowa federal court. The complaints in these suits asserted three separate grounds for recovery: (a) the royalty provisions of the old license agreements (Counts I and II); (b) quantum meruit for the reasonable value of the use \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 462]\n\u00a0\n of the patents (Counts III and IV);\n13\n and (c) damages for patent infringement (Count V).\n\nThereafter, National and Certain-teed, claiming that the institution of the Iowa actions violated the 1951 decree, and that in any event Gypsum was barred from recovery by reason of unpurged misuse of the patents involved, petitioned the antitrust court to enjoin further prosecution of the actions.\n14\n The Government also filed a separate petition to enjoin Gypsum from maintaining any action based on the illegal license agreements, but took no position on Gypsum's right to recover for the period in question on the grounds of quantum meruit or patent infringement.\n15\n Gypsum's answers to these petitions in substance alleged that the District Court was without jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the petitioners, and put in issue all of the allegations on which the right to relief was predicated.\n\nThe District Court decided that it had jurisdiction to grant relief (one judge dissenting), and, after hearing the parties through briefs and oral argument, but without taking any evidence beyond that already of record in the antitrust proceeding, concluded that the 1951 decree should be modified so as to enjoin the prosecution of Gypsum's suits.\n16\n The court held that prosecution of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 463]\n\u00a0\n Counts I and II, which declared upon the illegal license agreements, could not be maintained under the terms of the 1951 decree. Although finding that the other three Counts were not barred by that decree, it further held that the suits should be prohibited in their entirety because of Gypsum's unpurged misuse of its patents.\n17\n There followed the modifying decree of December 9, 1954,\n18\n from which this appeal was taken. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n350 \nU.S. 946\n. For the reasons given hereafter we conclude that, except as it related to the two causes of action based on the illegal license agreements (Counts I and II), this proscriptive modification of the 1951 decree was not justified by the record before the District Court.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nPreliminarily, we conclude that three aspects of the lower court's holding must be upheld. First, we think that Article X of the 1951 decree, reserving to the antitrust court jurisdiction, upon application of \"any of the parties\" to the decree, to make such \"directions\" and \"modifications\" as may be appropriate to the \"carrying out\" and \"enforcement\" of the decree, provided a fully adequate basis for the jurisdiction exercised below.\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 464]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Swift & Co., \n286 \nU.S. 106, 114\n; Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Co. v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 502\n. See also Chrysler Corp. v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 556\n. Gypsum argues that insofar as the relief granted below was rested upon patent misuse, instead of a construction of the 1951 decree which was the basis of enjoining the prosecution of Counts I and II of Gypsum's suits, the lower court's decision involved a determination of a collateral private controversy between this group of antitrust defendants, rather than a \"carrying out\" or \"enforcement\" of the terms of that decree. But we think that whether Gypsum was barred from recovery in these suits by reason of the abuse of its patent rights was a problem sufficiently related to the rationale of the 1951 decree to bring it within the reserved jurisdiction clause. This is especially so because patent misuse was the essence of the old antitrust litigation, and its continuance or renewal were thus issues peculiarly within the province of the antitrust court, whose determination would avoid multiple litigation and possibly conflicting decisions on that issue among the courts in which Gypsum had brought suit.\n\nLikewise we conclude that there is no basis for disturbing the District Court's determinations that prosecution of Counts I and II, based on the old license agreements, was not permissible under the 1951 decree,\n20\n but that its \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 465]\n\u00a0\n terms did not reach the quantum meruit and infringement Counts.\n21\n\u00a0\n\nThe outcome of this appeal then turns on whether the District Court was right in holding as a matter of law that Gypsum was barred from any kind of recovery for the pendente lite use of its patents because of their unpurged misuse. It is now, of course, familiar law that the courts will not aid a patent owner who has misused his patents to recover any of their emoluments accruing during the period of misuse or thereafter until the effects of such misuse have been dissipated, or \"purged\" as the conventional saying goes. Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., \n314 \nU.S. 488\n; B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, \n314 \nU.S. 495\n; Edward Katzinger Co. v. Chicago Metallic Mfg. Co., \n329 \nU.S. 394\n; MacGregor v. Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co., \n329 \nU.S. 402\n; Mercoid Corp. v. Minneapolis Honeywell Regulator Co., \n320 \nU.S. 680\n. The rule is an extension of the equitable doctrine of \"unclean hands\" to the patent field. In terms of this case this means that Gypsum may not recover from these appellees for their use of its patents between February 1, 1948, and May 15, 1951, if Gypsum has been guilty of misuse of the patents since 1948, or if the original misuse found in the antitrust litigation remained unpurged. This issue, of course, involves essentially a question of fact. And since the record is barren of any facts with respect to the situation existing in the gypsum industry since 1941, we think that the District Court erred in holding purely as a matter of law that an unpurged misuse had been shown. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 466]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nPutting aside the two contract Counts, the enjoining of which we have held was sufficiently supported by the court's finding that they could not be maintained under the terms of the 1951 decree, there are three aspects to the lower court's holding as to the remaining Counts. First, the court held those Counts barred because Gypsum had engaged in \"fresh\" patent misuse - misuse unrelated to the original antitrust litigation. Secondly, it was held that since the \"old\" misuse adjudicated in the antitrust proceeding had continued unpurged, recovery must in any case be barred.\n22\n And finally, the court held that irrespective of purge, the \"old\" misuse itself was sufficient to bar the patent infringement Count. We discuss each of these holdings in turn.\n\n\nA.\n\n\n\nThe \"fresh\" misuse found by the lower court was simply the fact of the inclusion of Counts I and II in the 1953 suits. These Counts sought recovery of royalties under the illegal licensing agreements. Such inclusion, the court held, was a renewed attempt to enforce these illegal agreements, and as such should be regarded as a new misuse of the patents which barred recovery under the other Counts as well.\n23\n We do not agree.\n\nThe five Counts in Gypsum's complaints were merely alternative legal theories for reaching a single end, namely, recovery for the pendente lite use of Gypsum's patents. Had the complaints declared only upon the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 467]\n\u00a0\n quantum meruit and infringement Counts the mere bringing of the suits could then hardly have been regarded as fresh misuse, even though recovery might be defeated by showing some independent unpurged misuse of the patents involved. For as the lower court recognized, such recovery by way of quantum meruit or damages for infringement was not \"expressly or impliedly\" touched by the terms of the 1951 decree. Gypsum explains the inclusion of the two contract Counts as precautionary pleading to fend against the possibility that the defendants, if sued only for quantum meruit and infringement, might set up the license agreements in defense.\n24\n Such alternative pleading is expressly sanctioned by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 8, and, even though that defense has turned out to be untenable in light of the lower court's findings, we think that it distorts the doctrine of patent misuse to hold that recourse to this method of pleading here vitiated the other Counts of the complaints.\n25\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, in view of what transpired before the antitrust court in the hearings relating to the settlement of the 1949 decree, we are by no means satisfied that Gypsum was not entitled to a bona fide guess, at least as a matter of alternative pleading, that the decree would not be interpreted as barring the collection of these interim royalties. At those hearings counsel for one of the defendants, Celotex, without remonstrance by either of these respondents, stated:\n\n \"In order that United States Gypsum will have no misunderstanding of my position, I want them to know that my suggestion [that the decree should \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 468]\n\u00a0\n declare the licenses `illegal, null and void'] is in no sense based on any hope or desire on my part to get out of any license fees during any interim period, and if we can agree . . . as far as my client is concerned, we are willing to let the royalty rate [of the new compulsory licenses], whatever it is, agreed upon apply back to the time when we ceased paying royalties. I just want to make it clear to all that we are not attempting by this declaration of illegality of them to find some way of avoiding the license fees which during this [litigation] none of us have paid.\"\n\n\n Further, both the Government and the other co-defendants at that time seem to have regarded the \"illegal, null and void\" provisions of the decree as simply the equivalent of \"cancellation\" of the licenses. In view of the narrow adjudication of violation by this Court, infra, p. 470, we cannot say that Gypsum could not have reasonably entertained the belief that the price fixing provisions of the license agreements would ultimately be held separable from the basic undertaking to pay royalties. Indeed, the new licenses, authorized by the decree, which omitted the price fixing clauses, carried the same royalty rate on products made under the patents.\n\nWe conclude that in the circumstances present here it was error to regard the inclusion of the contract Counts as constituting a \"fresh\" patent misuse on Gypsum's part.\n\n\nB.\n\n\n\nWe come next to the holding that the \"old\" misuse, found in the antitrust proceeding, continued unpurged through the 1948-1951 period. And here we are met immediately by the fact that the record before the antitrust court is completely bare of any facts relating to this period, or indeed any period after 1941. For the Government's proof in the antitrust case, presented from 1940 to 1944, concerned the gypsum industry prior to and until \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 469]\n\u00a0\n 1941, and no further evidence has ever been introduced into any of these litigations. We thus know literally nothing about the state of the gypsum industry between 1948, when this Court, on evidence not extending beyond 1941, first held that there had been an antitrust violation, and 1951. How, then, can we assume that this earlier violation, adjudicated for the first time in 1948, continued thereafter?\n\nThe answer to this question depends on the nature and extent of that violation. According to Gypsum, the only illegality ever adjudicated was the fixing of prices on gypsum materials under the industry-wide uniform price fixing clauses of patent licenses which were found to have been the product of concerted action between Gypsum and its co-defendants. In other words, Gypsum, relying on the 1949 decree, which followed this Court's first decision, and its underlying findings,\n26\n argues that the maintenance of uniform patent licenses with price fixing clauses was the only patent misuse ever found. It then points out that it offered to prove below that price fixing in the industry stopped in 1941, and that the licenses were rescinded in 1948. Add to this the fact that the 1949 decree, and again this Court's 1950 interlocutory decree, enjoined Gypsum from enforcing these licenses, and, says Gypsum, the inference arises that the only patent misuse ever adjudicated had ceased by 1948 - an inference at least sufficient to allow the issue to go to trial on the facts.\n\nAccording to appellees National and Certain-teed, however, the adjudication of misuse in the antitrust proceeding was much broader, encompassing the regimentation of the entire gypsum industry, the restraint of commerce in unpatented gypsum products, the elimination of jobbers, and the standardization of trade practices throughout \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 470]\n\u00a0\n the industry. This broad view of the character of the antitrust violation rests upon this Court's 1950 decision, which held the 1949 decree too narrow and allowed the Government the broader relief embodied in the 1951 decree.\n27\n Appellees argue that the fact that this Court felt it necessary to broaden the 1949 decree involved by necessity an adjudication of broad patent misuse, misuse not prohibited by the 1949 decree and therefore left unpurged by it. In other words, the argument runs, the broadening of the decree by this Court necessarily involved a holding that Gypsum was guilty of violations not proscribed by the original decree, violations which existed unpurged during part or all of the 1948-1951 period, since they were first adjudicated by this Court in 1950 and presumptively continued until 1951, when they were finally dealt with by the 1951 decree.\n\nAppellees' argument is ingenious, but incorrect. The course of decisions in the antitrust litigation clearly shows that the only misuse ever adjudicated was that arising from the uniform price fixing provisions of the license agreements. In the original suit the only undisputed issue of fact was that Gypsum had given its competitors uniform patent licenses containing a price fixing clause. The Government also charged Gypsum with a variety of other abuses, including price fixing on unpatented articles, elimination of jobbers, and standardization of trade practices. All of these charges were put in issue by Gypsum. On the appeal from the original dismissal of the proceedings, this Court held that the uniform price fixing licenses constituted a per se antitrust violation, and also that the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 471]\n\u00a0\n Government's evidence as to the other matters constituted a prima facie case of additional violation.\n28\n On remand, the District Court, instead of going into a factual trial of these other matters, granted summary judgment on the price fixing violation. This left all of the other matters still at issue. They continued to remain at issue after the ensuing appeals to this Court, for in affirming the summary judgment\n29\n and broadening the 1949 decree,\n30\n this Court made it clear that it was proceeding solely on the basis of the narrow antitrust violation found by the District Court:\n31\n\u00a0\n\n \"We agree with a statement made by counsel for the Government in argument below that as a `matter of formulating the decree' many facts offered to be proven would have effect upon the conclusion of a court as to the decree's terms. However, we read the preliminary statement of the District Court . . . as an adjudication of violation of the Sherman Act by the action in concert of the defendants through the fixed-price licenses, accepting as true the underlying facts in defendants' proof by proffer. The trial judges understood the summary judgment to be, as Judge Stephens said, `limited to that one undisputed question.' Judge Garrett and Judge Jackson agreed. That conclusion entitled the Government only to relief based on that finding and the proffered facts. On that basis we dismissed United States Gypsum's appeal from the decree, and on that basis we examine the Government's objection to the decree.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  . \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 472]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"[A decree] is not limited to prohibition of the proven means by which the evil was accomplished, but may range broadly through practices connected with acts actually found to be illegal. . . .\n\n\n \". . . We turn then to the Government's proposals for modification of the decree on the assumption that only a violation through concerted industry license agreements has been proven, but recognizing, as is conceded by defendants, that relief, to be effective, must go beyond the narrow limits of the proven violation.\" \n340 \nU.S., at 87\n-89, 90.\n32\n\u00a0\n\n\n Thus we see that the only patent misuse that has ever been established in this long-drawn-out litigation is concerted price fixing under the former patent licenses, and that the 1950 holding of this Court was not an adjudication of other violations but only an application of the well-known principle that relief in antitrust cases may range beyond the narrow area of proven violations. Nothing, therefore, in the broadening of the decree supports the inference that the acts prohibited therein and left open in the 1949 decree continued in the pendente lite period or, in fact, had ever taken place. Perhaps Gypsum did engage in broad regimentation of the industry, as charged in the Government's 1940 complaint, and \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 473]\n\u00a0\n perhaps such misuse or its effects continued through 1951. But there is nothing in this record to show that any such hypothesis is true, and no part of it has ever been proved. The question is one of fact, and Gypsum is entitled to go to trial on it.\n\nNor is it enough to sustain the judgment below to say, as appellees do, that the conceded \"old\" misuse, consisting of industry-wide price fixing through uniform patent licenses, should be presumed to have continued unpurged into the 1948-1951 period. The record shows, without dispute so far, that for seven years before the beginning of the 1948-1951 period Gypsum had not engaged in price fixing, and that for two of those three years price fixing had been under injunction. These factors raised a sufficient inference of purge prior to the critical period to entitle Gypsum to go to trial on the point and to prevent the court from granting what in effect was summary judgment. Cf. United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, \n343 \nU.S. 326\n. Nor do we think this conclusion is overcome by the lower court's findings that the \"five acts\" of purge offered by Gypsum were not sufficient to establish purge. We express no opinion upon the merits of these findings, for their sufficiency can hardly be judged in isolation from the facts as to competitive conditions in the gypsum industry during the 1941-1951 period, on which the record is silent. And other alleged antitrust violations are not now available to appellees as acts of misuse, for as to them Gypsum has not yet had its day in court.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that the judgment below cannot be supported on the basis of the claimed unpurged \"old\" misuse.\n\n\nC.\n\n\n\nWe pass lastly to the lower court's holding that the \"old\" misuse, without regard to purge, barred the infringement Count of Gypsum's suits. In effect this holding \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 474]\n\u00a0\n was that, because \"of the practical and legal situation,\" proscription of this Count should be added by relation back, as it were, to the relief already accorded by the 1951 decree. Admittedly such relief was neither obtained nor sought by the Government in either the 1949 or 1951 decree proceedings. To be sure one of the prayers for relief in the Government's antitrust complaint in 1940 had been that the defendants should be enjoined from bringing any action for infringement of any of the patents involved or from attempting to collect in any way royalties or fees for their use until all misuse had been abandoned and its consequences dissipated. In the subsequent 1949 and 1951 decree and appellate proceedings, however, this item of proposed relief was never adverted to, much less pressed upon the courts. And even in the 1953-1954 modification proceedings, and now, the Government does not contend that Gypsum is precluded from maintaining the infringement Count. The conclusion seems inescapable that the Government's original request for such relief was in effect withdrawn. In this state of affairs we think this relief should not have been added to the decree in 1954, in the absence of proof of intervening circumstances indicating its need in the public interest. Cf. Hughes v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 353\n. There was no such proof, and without it the proscription of the infringement Count amounted to the imposition of an unwarranted penalty on Gypsum.\n\nNor do we think that anything in the Hartford-Empire cases, \n323 \nU.S. 386, 324\n U.S. 570, to which the lower court attached much weight, justifies what was done here. The basic difference between Hartford and this case is that in Hartford the injunction against infringement suits on Hartford's misused patents was part of the original relief granted the Government, whereas here that relief was added, without the taking of any evidence as to justifying intervening circumstances, some five years after the original \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 475]\n\u00a0\n decree was entered in the District Court, and three years after its enlargement pursuant to the 1950 decision of this Court,\n33\n which made no mention of this type of relief.\n\nMoreover, the factors justifying such relief in Hartford were quite different from those involved here, in that the litigated findings of fact as to Hartford's violation of the antitrust laws were much broader than anything found here. See supra, p. 470. Beyond this, in Hartford only infringement suits against nondefendants were enjoined, and not, as here, suits against co-defendants; and despite the breadth of Hartford's violations, this Court held that Hartford was entitled to quantum meruit compensation for the pendente lite use of its patents unless further violations of the antitrust laws during that period were shown. No such violations on Gypsum's part were shown or claimed by the Government or appellees, except for the inclusion of the contract Counts in Gypsum's suits, a contention which has already been met. And although the Court in Hartford struck down royaltyfree compulsory licensing as part of the relief, the District Court here in effect held these appellees entitled to three years' free use of Gypsum's patents. We thus find no parallel between this case and Hartford.\n34\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 476]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur conclusions then are these: The enjoining of Counts I and II of Gypsum's Iowa suits was proper, and upon remand the District Court may, be appropriate modification of the decree of May 15, 1951, or otherwise, require Gypsum to discontinue and dismiss such Counts with prejudice. The enjoining of Counts III, IV and V of those suits was not justified upon this record, and as to them the case should be remanded to the District Court for the taking of evidence upon the issues of misuse and purge as they may relate to the period since February 1, 1948. We think it appropriate that these issues should be tried and disposed of by the antitrust court rather than the Iowa court, both because of reasons already given, supra, pp. 463-464, and because of the antitrust court's familiarity with what has occurred in these protracted litigations.\n35\n However, should the antitrust court conclude that Gypsum is not barred fom recovery on Counts III, IV or V by reason of unpurged patent misuse, we think that the trial and disposition of all other issues, including any defense of patent invalidity, should then take place in the District Courts in which the two suits are pending. There is no reason why the three-judge court should be burdened with such issues.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment below and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE CLARK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Throughout this opinion United States Gypsum Company will be referred to as \"Gypsum\", National Gypsum Company as \"National,\" and Certain-teed Products Corporation as \"Certain-teed.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The suits against National and Certain-teed were brought in the Northern District of Iowa.

Supp. 573. Judge Cole dissented on the jurisdictional ground. 124 F. Supp. 598. On December 9, 1954, the District Court denied reconsideration, Record, p. 1136; and on June 30, 1955, it denied Gypsum's motion for a new trial. 134 F. Supp. 69.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The court also held that Count III should be barred because it was \"but a left-handed, indirect method for recovering such royalties.\" The court did not elaborate on this, but since it held that this Count was not \"expressly or impliedly\" covered by the 1951 decree we think this additional ground requires no separate discussion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The operative part of the decree reads as follows: \"Defendant United States Gypsum Company is hereby ordered and directed to discontinue and to dismiss, with prejudice to United States Gypsum Company, its pending actions as follows: against National Gypsum Company, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa; against Certain-Teed Products Corporation, in the same District Court . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Article X reads: \"Jurisdiction of this cause, and of the parties hereto, is retained by the Court for the purpose of enabling any of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 464]\n\u00a0\n the parties to this decree, or any other person, firm or corporation that may hereafter become bound thereby in whole or in part, to apply to this Court at any time for such orders, modifications, vacations or directions as may be necessary or appropriate (1) for the construction or carrying out of this decree, and (2) for the enforcement of compliance therewith.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Article IV of the 1951 decree had adjudicated as to all defendants that these license agreements were \"unlawful under the antitrust laws of the United States and illegal, null and void.\" Article V enjoined the defendants from \"performing\" such agreements. Cf. Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Louis Voight & Sons Co., \n212 \nU.S. 227\n. It might be well to add that the 1951 decree would similarly \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 465]\n\u00a0\n prevent the use of these illegal agreements as defenses by co-defendants National and Certain-teed against the quantum meruit and infringement Counts of Gypsum's suits.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] As appears, infra, p. 474, the Government at one time had sought to bar all such claims for recovery on the patents, but later in effect abandoned that request for relief.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Counts I and II were also held barred on these grounds.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] We assume that if the inclusion of Counts I and II constituted a \"fresh\" patent misuse, the fact that they were not asserted until 1953 would make no difference in their effectiveness to bar recovery for the 1948-1951 period.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] National had in fact pleaded that defense in the suit against it. But see n. 20, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] In view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to deal with the contention that the lower court's holding also violated 35 U.S.C. 271 (d).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] See n. 6, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] \n340 \nU.S. 76\n. This relief included the extension of the injunctive provisions to the entire United States (instead of merely the East) and to all gypsum products (instead of only gypsum board), compulsory licensing for an indefinite period (instead of for only 90 days), such licensing to include after-acquired (instead of only existing) patents.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] \n333 \nU.S. 364\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] \n339 \nU.S. 960\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] \n340 \nU.S. 76\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] As we have seen, supra, pp. 460-461, the Court dismissed Gypsum's appeal from the 1949 decree. \n339 \nU.S. 959\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] That this Court's expansion of the 1949 decree did not involve a corresponding holding of broader violation is illustrated by what was done with respect to the geographical area covered by the decree. The Government's complaint charged Gypsum with violation only in the eastern part of the United States. There was never any claim, much less proof, that Gypsum engaged in any improper activities in the West. Yet the Court granted the Government's prayer that the 1949 decree be broadened to cover the whole United States. This was done not because it was alleged or proved that Gypsum had done anything illegal in the West, but simply on the theory that effective relief required that the decree be broader than the \"proven violation.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] \n340 \nU.S. 76\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] National makes a further contention as to the quantum meruit Counts. It argues that these Counts in any event were properly proscribed because they related to an illegal transaction. But the rule on which National relies applies only where the quantum meruit claim declares upon an implied agreement which, had it been reduced to an express contract, would itself have been illegal; that is, a contract where the kind of consideration moving between the parties is wholly against public policy, as, for example, a contract to commit murder. The implied contract here was not of that character, for certainly an express contract simply for reasonable compensation for the use of Gypsum's patents would not have been illegal.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] We recognize that the composition of the three-judge court has completely changed since the main antitrust case was tried. Even so, the present court has acquired an intimate knowledge of the record. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 477]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nI would affirm the judgment of the United States District Court.\n\nFor many years appellees used patents belonging to the appellant, United States Gypsum Company, under certain license agreements. On March 8, 1948, this Court decided that on the record before it these license agreements constituted a conspiracy between Gypsum and its licensees to violate the Sherman Act. \n333 \nU.S. 364\n. Appellees then ceased paying royalties under their license agreement until May 15, 1951, on which date the United States District Court rendered a final decree holding the license agreements null and void. On this latter date new patent licenses were obtained from Gypsum which did not contain the illegal provisions and were not part of a conspiracy to violate the Sherman Act. This is a suit to make appellees pay for the use of Gypsum's patents during the period of February 1, 1948, to May 1951. Gypsum seeks payment in five separate counts. Counts one and two assert claims under the old outlawed license agreements. I agree with the Court's holding that Gypsum cannot recover on these counts. I also agree that the patent misuse rule which bars recovery \"is an extension of the equitable doctrine of `unclean hands' to the patent field.\" I disagree with the Court's holding that Gypsum is not barred from attempting to recover for the use of its patents during the period on the other three counts of \"quantum meruit.\" \"indebitatus assumpsit,\" and \"infringement.\"\n\nIn declining to permit Gypsum to recover under the license agreements the Court here necessarily does so on the ground that the licenses were a part of an unlawful conspiracy to violate the Sherman Act. That conspiracy \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 478]\n\u00a0\n existed as long as the illegal agreements remained in existence.\n1\n And the agreements could and did continue to exist whether or not their inseparable parts,\n2\n such as the price-fixing provisions, were enforced from time to time. Any attempt to enforce directly or indirectly any part of the illegal agreements shows that the agreements and the conspiracy were still in existence. The present holding clearly indicates their continuing existence during the period in question. The majority appears to recognize this coexistence of the license agreements and the conspiracy when it bars a recovery for the use of the patents so long as the suits are for \"royalties\" under the contracts. But under the Court's holding persons who misuse their patents hereafter, and who could not, under our prior cases, recover compensation for patent use because of their illegal agreements, may now, in some instances, be able to recover full compensation by labeling their causes of action \"indebitatus assumpsit\" or \"quantum meruit.\" To permit a Sherman Act conspirator to recover for patent use under any label from a co-conspirator where the licensing agreement for that patent was held void as an integral part of the conspiracy runs counter to the doctrine of \"unclean hands.\" That doctrine rests basically on the idea that the law leaves wrong-doers where it finds them. The Court does not do so here. Appellant and appellees have been found guilty of an unlawful conspiracy to violate the Sherman Act. Gypsum's patents were an essential part of that conspiracy. But by giving its lawsuits appropriate labels it has obtained \n\n[352 \nU.S. 457, 479]\n\u00a0\n an opportunity to seek compensation for the use of tools it supplied to violate the law. I agree with the District Court that to allow recovery on these differently labeled counts \"is but a left-handed, indirect method for recovering the royalties provided in the illegal license agreements.\" As I see it this permits \"a licensor to be protected on an illegal contract merely because he chose one remedy rather than another on the same substantive issue.\" Edward Katzinger Co. v. Chicago Metallic Mfg. Co., \n329 \nU.S. 394, 399\n-400. I think the Court's holding seriously weakens the patent misuse doctrine and thereby makes enforcement of the Sherman Act far more difficult.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"It is the `contract, combination . . . or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce' which 1 of the Act strikes down, whether the concerted activity be wholly nascent or abortive on the one hand, or successful on the other.\" United States v.

ALLEN-BRADLEY CO.(1957)\nNo. 78\nArgued: December 13, 1956Decided: January 22, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Under 124 (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, the War Production Board had authority to certify that only a part of the cost of essential wartime expansion of production facilities of a private manufacturer was \"necessary in the interest of national defense,\" so as to be amortizable within five years or less under 23 (t) and 124 for income-tax purposes. Pp. 306-311.\n\n 134 Ct. Cl. 800, reversed.\n\nHilbert P. Zarky argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice, Philip Elman and Joseph F. Goetten.\n\nHarvey W. Peters argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn 1940 this country embarked on the greatest program of defense preparedness in its history. Such an undertaking called for a vast expansion of the nation's industrial capacity. New and improved facilities were desperately needed, not only for the production of guns, planes and the other obvious weapons of war, but also for the innumerable items that are essential to the prosecution of large-scale conflict. This unprecedented program of expansion demanded the full and immediate cooperation of everyone who could lend assistance. While the Government attempted to secure the necessary facilities by building them itself or by extending emergency construction loans to private business, it soon appeared that these methods would not be adequate to meet the needs of defense. Private capital was called on for assistance in \n\n[352 \nU.S. 306, 307]\n\u00a0\n the task. However business exhibited a reluctance to build new war plants because of widespread fears that such facilities would become wholly useless when the emergency had passed. In response to these fears, Congress acted to lessen the financial risks involved in the private construction of emergency facilities. Among other things it amended the 1939 Internal Revenue Code by adding 23 (t) and 124,\n1\n which allowed business to write off the cost of new facilities as a deduction against taxable income within a period of five years or less, regardless of the actual economic life of the facilities, provided they had been certified by the proper executive agency as \"necessary in the interest of national defense.\" This accelerated amortization privilege generally enabled those businesses receiving it to reduce their federal income taxes with the net result that a large part of the construction costs was, at least temporarily, borne by the Federal Government through a reduction in its tax receipts.\n\nThis case involves a question of the proper interpretation of 124 (f), a vital part of these accelerated amortization provisions. The essential facts are not in dispute. During the Second World War the respondent Allen-Bradley Company produced radio parts and other materials needed by the Government to carry on the war. These products were in critically short supply and at the request of government procurement officers respondent repeatedly increased and improved its facilities in order to boost its output. In connection with such expansions it applied to the War Production Board, which was then the certifying authority, for certificates that the improvements were necessary to the national defense. The Board issued nine different certificates of necessity to respondent but the dispute here involves only three of these certificates. Each of these three stated that the facilities \n\n[352 \nU.S. 306, 308]\n\u00a0\n covered by it were necessary in the interest of national defense but only up to a specified percentage of their total cost. This \"partial certification\" was made pursuant to a policy adopted by the Board in 1943 that it would certify essential facilities, which could reasonably be expected to have peacetime utility, only to the extent that their costs were attributable to the wartime increase in prices. Respondent accepted these partial certifications, proceeded with the expansion and in its tax returns for 1944 and 1945 deducted an amount based on the accelerated amortization of that part of the total cost which had been certified by the Board.\n\nIn 1953 respondent first raised the claim which is the basis of this suit that the Board had no authority to certify only part of the cost of a necessary emergency facility. Respondent concedes that the Board had discretion to refuse to issue any certificate at all, but contends that once it decided that a facility was necessary to the national defense its function was at an end and that any attempt by it to limit the certification to a part of the cost of such facility was a nullity. Therefore, respondent contends, it was entitled to accelerate the amortization of the full cost of those facilities covered by the three partial certificates and not just that part of the full cost which had been certified by the Board. On the basis of these contentions respondent filed the present action in the Court of Claims to recover an alleged overpayment of its 1944 and 1945 income taxes. The Court of Claims accepted respondent's arguments and rendered judgment for it. 134 Ct. Cl. 800. We granted certiorari, \n351 \nU.S. 981\n, because of the conflict between this decision and that of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Commissioner v. National Lead Co., 230 F.2d 161.\n\nThe language of the crucial section 124 (f) is ambiguous. It specifies that in determining the amount of the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 306, 309]\n\u00a0\n wartime construction costs which are to be available for the special amortization privilege:\n\n \"(1) There shall be included only so much of the amount . . . as is properly attributable to such construction . . . after December 31, 1939, as [the War Production Board] has certified as necessary in the interest of national defense during the emergency period . . . .\"\n\n\n Respondent argues that the phrase \"only so much of the amount\" in this section refers simply to that part of the cost of facilities that is attributable to construction after 1939. On the other hand the Government contends that this qualifying phrase refers not only to those costs incurred after 1939, but also to that portion of those costs which the War Production Board has certified is necessary to the national defense. We believe that either interpretation is possible; that neither is compelled. But those who were responsible for the administration of the Act consistently interpreted 124 (f) as authorizing them to certify that only a part of the costs of construction after 1939 was necessary to the national defense.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe legislative history shows that Congress intended that the administrators of the certification program were to have broad discretion in exercising their power. These administrators were faced with extremely complicated problems in attempting to accomplish the desired objective of Congress in the face of constant and drastic changes in conditions. And as the nation's industrial capacity became more adequate they carefully balanced the need for the proposed expansion against the loss of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 306, 310]\n\u00a0\n revenue to the Government caused by accelerated amortization before issuing a certificate. The power to certify only a portion of the cost gave them a more flexible instrument to balance these conflicting objectives.\n\nIt appears that Congress kept close supervision over the certification program and the special amortization privilege. For example, 124 was amended five times during the war;\n3\n two of these amendments altered 124 (f) itself in a manner which did not affect the language decisive of the present controversy. But no attempt was made to restrain the administrators from issuing certificates covering only a part of the cost of necessary facilities, although it seems apparent that responsible committees of Congress were aware that 124 (f) had been consistently interpreted and applied by the certifying authorities as permitting them to issue such certifications. In fact a special Senate \"watch-dog\" committee was established to continually study and investigate the program for construction of war plants and facilities including the \". . . benefits accruing to contractors with respect to amortization for the purposes of taxation or otherwise . . . .\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\nPerhaps 124 (f) could have been construed differently. But it was not. Construed as it was, it served its purpose. It contributed materially to the phenomenal expansion of our industrial plants which was so necessary for successful prosecution of the war. Certificates issued for only a portion of the cost of necessary facilities were accepted by business in general, and respondent in particular - apparently without substantial objection. The technique employed in 124 (f) was a new one and those who drafted that section could not be certain how it would \n\n[352 \nU.S. 306, 311]\n\u00a0\n work in practice. They could not foresee the many problems that would arise in the administration of this sweeping power which could be used to encourage expansion of any industry producing materials useful in the all-out war effort. Therefore it is not strange that the provision was loosely drawn and, in some respects, imprecise. However it would have been strange in these circumstances if Congress had embarked on this new course without leaving wide discretion for flexible administration in the light of the day-to-day grind of experience. The language of 124 (f) lends itself to such flexibility.\n\nWe hold that the Board had authority under 124 (f) to issue certificates, as in this case, certifying that only a part of the cost of essential wartime improvements was necessary to the national defense. Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Claims must be reversed.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 54 Stat. 998-1003, as amended, 26 U.S.C. 23 (t), 124.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See War Department Regulations, Issuance of Necessity Certificates, 7 Fed.

JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nBoth the terms of the statute, and the fact that two courts of such special expertise in tax matters as the Tax Court and Court of Claims have sustained the taxpayer's position,\n1\n leave me doubtful as to whether, under the statutory provisions in question,\n2\n the War Production Board had the right to issue partial certificates. The Court finds ambiguity in the statute, but, in resolving that ambiguity as it has, does little more than point out \n\n[352 \nU.S. 306, 312]\n\u00a0\n that Congress did not interfere with the authority claimed by the Board.\n\nHowever, in my view the scope of the Board's powers need not be reached in this case, because, for the reasons given by Judge Lumbard in his opinion for the unanimous Court of Appeals in Commissioner v.

This is a direct appeal by the Government from a judgment of the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan dismissing a four-count indictment that charged appellee, a labor organization, with having made expenditures in violation of that law. Appellee had moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds (1) that it failed to state an offense under the statute and (2) that the provisions of the statute \"on their face and as construed and applied\" are unconstitutional. The district judge held that the indictment did not allege a statutory offense and that he was therefore not required to rule upon the constitutional questions presented. 138 F. Supp. 53. The case came here, \n351 \nU.S. 904\n, under the Criminal Appeals Act of 1907, as amended, 18 U.S.C. 3731.\n\nIt is desirable at the outset to quote the statute in its entirety:\n\n \"It is unlawful for any national bank, or any corporation organized by authority of any law of \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 569]\n\u00a0\n Congress, to make a contribution or expenditure in connection with any election to any political office, or in connection with any primary election or political convention or caucus held to select candidates for any political office, or for any corporation whatever, or any labor organization to make a contribution or expenditure in connection with any election at which Presidential and Vice Presidential electors or a Senator or Representative in, or a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to Congress are to be voted for, or in connection with any primary election or political convention or caucus held to select candidates for any of the foregoing offices, or for any candidate, political committee, or other person to accept or receive any contribution prohibited by this section.\n\n\n \"Every corporation or labor organization which makes any contribution or expenditure in violation of this section shall be fined not more than $5,000; and every officer or director of any corporation, or officer of any labor organization, who consents to any contribution or expenditure by the corporation or labor organization, as the case may be, and any person who accepts or receives any contribution, in violation of this section, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if the violation was willful, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\n\n\n \"For the purposes of this section `labor organization' means any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plan, in which employees participate and which exist for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 570]\n\u00a0\n wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.\" 18 U.S.C. 610, taken from the Act of June 23, 1947, 61 Stat. 136, 159.\n\n\n Appreciation of the circumstances that begot this statute is necessary for its understanding, and understanding of it is necessary for adjudication of the legal problems before us. Speaking broadly, what is involved here is the integrity of our electoral process, and, not less, the responsibility of the individual citizen for the successful functioning of that process. This case thus raises issues not less than basic to a democratic society.\n\nThe concentration of wealth consequent upon the industrial expansion in the post-Civil War era had profound implications for American life. The impact of the abuses resulting from this concentration gradually made itself felt by a rising tide of reform protest in the last decade of the nineteenth century. The Sherman Law was a response to the felt threat to economic freedom created by enormous industrial combines. The income tax law of 1894 reflected congressional concern over the growing disparity of income between the many and the few.\n\nNo less lively, although slower to evoke federal action, was popular feeling that aggregated capital unduly influenced politics, an influence not stopping short of corruption. The matter is not exaggerated by two leading historians:\n\n\"The nation was fabulously rich but its wealth was gravitating rapidly into the hands of a small portion of the population, and the power of wealth threatened to undermine the political integrity of the Republic.\" 2 Morison and Commager, The Growth of the American Republic (4th ed. 1950), 355.\n\n\n In the '90's many States passed laws requiring candidates for office and their political committees to make public \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 571]\n\u00a0\n the sources and amounts of contributions to their campaign funds and the recipients and amounts of their campaign expenditures. The theory behind these laws was that the spotlight of publicity would discourage corporations from making political contributions and would thereby end their control over party policies. But these state publicity laws either became dead letters or were found to be futile. As early as 1894, the soberminded Elihu Root saw the need for more effective legislation. He urged the Constitutional Convention of the State of New York to prohibit political contributions by corporations:\n\n \"The idea is to prevent . . . the great railroad companies, the great insurance companies, the great telephone companies, the great aggregations of wealth from using their corporate funds, directly or indirectly, to send members of the legislature to these halls in order to vote for their protection and the advancement of their interests as against those of the public. It strikes at a constantly growing evil which has done more to shake the confidence of the plain people of small means of this country in our political institutions than any other practice which has ever obtained since the foundation of our Government. And I believe that the time has come when something ought to be done to put a check to the giving of $50,000 or $100,000 by a great corporation toward political purposes upon the understanding that a debt is created from a political party to it.\" Quoted in Hearings before House Committee on Elections, 59th Cong., 1st Sess. 12; see Root, Addresses on Government and Citizenship (Bacon and Scott ed. 1916), 143.\n\n\n Concern over the size and source of campaign funds so actively entered the presidential campaign of 1904 \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 572]\n\u00a0\n that it crystallized popular sentiment for federal action to purge national politics of what was conceived to be the pernicious influence of \"big money\" campaign contributions. A few days after the election of 1904, the defeated candidate for the presidency said:\n\n\"The greatest moral question which now confronts us is, Shall the trusts and corporations be prevented from contributing money to control or aid in controlling elections?\" Quoted. Hearings, supra, at 56.\n\n\n President Theodore Roosevelt quickly responded to this national mood. In his annual message to Congress on December 5, 1905, he recommended that:\n\n\"All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts.\" 40 Cong. Rec. 96.\n\n\n Grist was added to the reformers' mill by the investigation of the great life insurance companies conducted by the Joint Committee of the New York Legislature, the Armstrong Committee, under the guidance of Charles Evans Hughes. The Committee's report, filed early in 1906, revealed that one insurance company alone had contributed almost $50,000 to a national campaign committee in 1904 and had given substantial amounts in preceding presidential campaigns. The Committee concluded:\n\n \"Contributions by insurance corporations for political purposes should be strictly forbidden. Neither executive officers nor directors should be allowed to use the moneys paid for purposes of insurance in support of political candidates or platforms. . . . \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 573]\n\u00a0\n Whether made for the purpose of supporting political views or with the desire to obtain protection for the corporation, these contributions have been wholly unjustifiable. In the one case executive officers have sought to impose their political views upon a constituency of divergent convictions, and in the other they have been guilty of a serious offense against public morals. The frank admission that moneys have been obtained for use in State campaigns upon the expectation that candidates thus aided in their election would support the interests of the companies, has exposed both those who solicited the contributions and those who made them to severe and just condemnation.\" Report of the Joint Committee of the Senate and Assembly of the State of New York Appointed to Investigate the Affairs of Life Insurance Companies, 397 (1906).\n\n\n Less than a month later the Committee on Elections of the House of Representatives began considering a number of proposals designed to cleanse the political process. Some bills prohibited political contributions by certain classes of corporations; some merely required disclosure of contributions; and others made bribery at elections a federal crime. The feeling of articulate reform groups was reflected at a public hearing held by the Committee. Perry Belmont, leader of a nation-wide organization advocating a federal publicity bill, stated:\n\n \". . . this thing has come to the breaking point. We have had enough of it. We don't want any more secret purchase of organizations, which nullifies platforms, nullifies political utterances and the pledges made by political leaders in and out of Congress.\" Hearings before House Committee on Elections, 59th Cong., 1st Sess. 12. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 574]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n This view found strong support in the testimony of Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor, who said, with respect to the publicity bill:\n\n \"Whether this bill meets all of the needs may be questioned; that is open to discussion; but the necessity for some law upon the subject is patent to every man who hopes for the maintenance of the institutions under which we live. It is doubtful to my mind if the contributions and expenditures of vast sums of money in the nominations and elections for our public offices can continue to increase without endangering the endurance of our Republic in its purity and in its essence.\n\n\n \". . . If the interests of any people are threatened by corruption in our public life or corruption in elections, surely it must of necessity be those, that large class of people, whom we for convenience term the wageworkers.\n\n\n \"I am not in a mood, and never am, to indulge in denunciations or criticism, but it does come to me sometimes that one of the reasons for the absence of legislation of a liberal or sympathetic or just character, so far as it affects the interest of the wage-earners of America, can be fairly well traced with the growth of the corruption funds and the influences that are in operation during elections and campaigns . . . . I am under the impression that the patience of the American workingmen is about exhausted -\n\n\n . . . . .\n\n\n \". . . [If] we are really determined that our elections shall be free from the power of money and its lavish use and expenditure without an accounting to the conscience and the judgment of the people of America, we will have to pass some measure of this kind.\" Id., at 28-31. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 575]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n President Roosevelt's annual message of 1906 listed as the first item of congressional business a law prohibiting political contributions by corporations. 41 Cong. Rec. 22. Shortly thereafter, in 1907, Congress provided:\n\n\"That it shall be unlawful for any national bank, or any corporation organized by authority of any laws of Congress, to make a money contribution in connection with any election to any political office. It shall also be unlawful for any corporation whatever to make a money contribution in connection with any election at which Presidential and Vice-Presidential electors or a Representative in Congress is to be voted for or any election by any State legislature of a United States Senator.\" 34 Stat. 864.\n\n\n As the historical background of this statute indicates, its aim was not merely to prevent the subversion of the integrity of the electoral process. Its underlying philosophy was to sustain the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen in a democracy for the wise conduct of government.\n\nThis Act of 1907 was merely the first concrete manifestation of a continuing congressional concern for elections \"free from the power of money.\" (See statement of Samuel Gompers, supra.) The 1909 Congress witnessed unsuccessful attempts to amend the Act to proscribe the contribution of anything of value and to extend its application to the election of state legislatures. The Congress of 1910 translated popular demand for further curbs upon the political power of wealth into a publicity law that required committees operating to influence the results of congressional elections in two or more States to report all contributions and disbursements and to identify contributors and recipients of substantial sums. That law also required persons who spent more than $50 annually \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 576]\n\u00a0\n for the purpose of influencing congressional elections in more than one State to report those expenditures if they were not made through a political committee. 36 Stat. 822. At the next session that Act was extended to require all candidates for the Senate and the House of Representatives to make detailed reports with respect to both nominating and election campaigns. The amendment also placed maximum limits on the amounts that congressional candidates could spend in seeking nomination and election, and forbade them from promising employment for the purpose of obtaining support. 37 Stat. 25. And in 1918 Congress made it unlawful either to offer or to solicit anything of value to influence voting. 40 Stat. 1013.\n\nThis Court's decision in Newberry v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 232\n, invalidating federal regulation of Senate primary elections, led to the Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925, 43 Stat. 1070, a comprehensive revision of existing legislation. The debates preceding that Act's passage reveal an attitude important to an understanding of the course of this legislation. Thus, Senator Robinson, one of the leaders of the Senate, said:\n\n \"We all know. . . that one of the great political evils of the time is the apparent hold on political parties which business interests and certain organizations seek and sometimes obtain by reason of liberal campaign contributions. Many believe that when an individual or association of individuals makes large contributions for the purpose of aiding candidates of political parties in winning the elections, they expect, and sometimes demand, and occasionally, at least, receive, consideration by the beneficiaries of their contributions which not infrequently is harmful to the general public interest. It is unquestionably \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 577]\n\u00a0\n an evil which ought to be dealt with, and dealt with intelligently and effectively.\" 65 Cong. Rec. 9507-9508.\n\n\n One of the means chosen by Congress to deal with this evil was 313 of the 1925 Act, which strengthened the 1907 statute (1) by changing the phrase \"money contribution\" to \"contribution\" ( 302 (d) defined \"contribution\" broadly); (2) by extending the prohibition on corporate contributions to the election to Congress of Delegates and Resident Commissioners; and (3) by penalizing the recipient of any forbidden contribution as well as the contributor.\n\nWhen, in 1940, Congress moved to extend the Hatch Act, 53 Stat. 1147, which was designed to free the political process of the abuses deemed to accompany the operation of a vast civil administration, its reforming zeal also led Congress to place further restrictions upon the political potentialities of wealth. Section 20 of the law amending the Hatch Act made it unlawful for any \"political committee,\" as defined in the Act of 1925, to receive contributions of more than $3,000,000 or to make expenditures of more than that amount in any calendar year. And 13 made it unlawful \"for any person, directly or indirectly, to make contributions in an aggregate amount in excess of $5,000, during any calendar year, or in connection with any campaign for nomination or election, to or on behalf of any candidate for an elective Federal office\" or any committee supporting such a candidate. The term \"person\" was defined to include any committee, association, organization or other group of persons. 54 Stat. 767. In offering 13 from the Senate floor Senator Bankhead said:\n\n \"We all know that money is the chief source of corruption. We all know that large contributions \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 578]\n\u00a0\n to political campaigns not only put the political party under obligation to the large contributors, who demand pay in the way of legislation, but we also know that large sums of money are used for the purpose of conducting expensive campaigns through the newspapers and over the radio; in the publication of all sorts of literature, true and untrue; and for the purpose of paying the expenses of campaigners sent out into the country to spread propaganda, both true and untrue.\" 86 Cong. Rec. 2720.\n\n\n The need for unprecedented economic mobilization propelled by World War II enormously stimulated the power of organized labor and soon aroused consciousness of its power outside its ranks. Wartime strikes gave rise to fears of the new concentration of power represented by the gains of trade unionism. And so the belief grew that, just as the great corporations had made huge political contributions to influence governmental action or inaction, whether consciously or unconsciously, the powerful unions were pursuing a similar course, and with the same untoward consequences for the democratic process. Thus, in 1943, when Congress passed the Smith-Connally Act to secure defense production against work stoppages, contained therein was a provision extending to labor organizations, for the duration of the war, 313 of the Corrupt Practices Act. 57 Stat. 163, 167. The testimony of Congressman Landis, author of this measure, before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Labor makes plain the dominant concern that evoked it:\n\n \"The fact that a hearing has been granted is a high tribute to the ability of the Labor Committee to recognize the fact that public opinion toward the conduct of labor unions is rapidly undergoing a change. The public thinks, and has a right to think, that labor unions, as public institutions should be \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 579]\n\u00a0\n granted the same rights and no greater rights than any other public group. My bill seeks to put labor unions on exactly the same basis, insofar as their financial activities are concerned, as corporations have been on for many years.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . One of the matters upon which I sensed that the public was taking a stand opposite to that of labor leaders was the question of the handling of funds of labor organizations. The public was aroused by many rumors of huge war chests being maintained by labor unions, of enormous fees and dues being extorted from war workers, of political contributions to parties and candidates which later were held as clubs over the head of high Federal officials.\n\n\n .  . .  .   .\n\n\n \". . . The source of much of the national trouble today in the coal strike situation is that ill-advised political contribution of another day [referring, apparently, to the reported contribution of over $400,000 by the United Mine Workers in the 1936 campaign, see S. Rep. No. 151, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.]. If the provision of my bill against such an activity has [sic] been in force when that contribution was made, the Nation, the administration, and the labor unions would be better off.\" Hearings before a Sub-committee of the House Committee on Labor on H. R. 804 and H. R. 1483, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, 2, 4.\n\n\n Despite 313's wartime application to labor organizations Congress was advised of enormous financial outlays said to have been made by some unions in connection with the national elections of 1944. The Senate's Special Committee on Campaign Expenditures investigated, inter alia, the role of the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The Committee \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 580]\n\u00a0\n found \"no clear-cut violation of the Corrupt Practices Act on the part of the Political Action Committee\" on the ground that it had made direct contributions only to candidates and political committees involved in state and local elections and federal primaries, to which the Act did not apply, and had limited its participation in federal elections to political \"expenditures,\" as distinguished from \"contributions\" to candidates or committees. S. Rep. No. 101, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. 23. The Committee also investigated, on complaint of Senator Taft, the Ohio C. I. O. Council's distribution to the public at large of 200,000 copies of a pamphlet opposing the re-election of Senator Taft and supporting his rival. In response to the C. I. O.'s assertion that this was not a proscribed \"contribution\" but merely an \"expenditure of its own funds to state its position to the world, exercising its right of free speech . . . .\" the Committee requested the Department of Justice to bring a test case on these facts. Id., at 59. It also recommended extension of 313 to cover primary campaigns and nominating conventions. Id., at 81. A minority of the Committee, Senators Ball and Ferguson, advocated further amendment of 313 to proscribe \"expenditures\" as well as \"contributions\" in order to avoid the possibility of emasculation of the statutory policy through a narrow judicial construction of \"contributions.\" Id., at 83.\n\nThe 1945 Report of the House Special Committee to Investigate Campaign Expenditures expressed concern over the vast amounts that some labor organizations were devoting to politics:\n\n \"The scale of operations of some of these organizations is impressive. Without exception, they operate on a Nation-wide basis; and many of them have affiliated local organizations. One was found to have an annual budget for `educational' work approximating \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 581]\n\u00a0\n $1,500,000, and among other things regularly supplies over 500 radio stations with `briefs for broadcasters.' Another, with an annual budget of over $300,000 for political `education,' has distributed some 80,000,000 pieces of literature, including a quarter million copies of one article. Another, representing an organized labor membership of 5,000,000, has raised $700,000 for its national organizations in union contributions for political `education' in a few months, and a great deal more has been raised for the same purpose and expended by its local organizations.\" H. R. Rep. No. 2093, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 3.\n\n\n Like the Senate Committee, it advocated extension of 313 to primaries and nominating conventions, id., at 9, and noted the existence of a controversy over the scope of \"contribution.\" Id., at 11. The following year the House Committee made a further study of the activities of organizations attempting to influence the outcome of federal elections. It found that the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen and other groups employed professional political organizers, sponsored partisan radio programs and distributed campaign literature. H. R. Rep. No. 2739, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 36-37. It concluded that:\n\n \"The intent and purpose of the provision of the act prohibiting any corporation or labor organization making any contribution in connection with any election would be wholly defeated if it were assumed that the term `making any contribution' related only to the donating of money directly to a candidate, and excluded the vast expenditures of money in the activities herein shown to be engaged in extensively. Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf? \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 582]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"The committee is firmly convinced, after a thorough study of the provisions of the act, the legislative history of the same, and the debates on the said provisions when it was pending before the House, that the act was intended to prohibit such expenditures.\" Id., at 40.\n\n\n Accordingly, to prevent further evasion of the statutory policy, the Committee attached to its recommendation that the prohibition of contributions by labor organizations be made permanent the additional proposal that the statute\n\n\"be clarified so as to specifically provide that expenditures of money for salaries to organizers, purchase of radio time, and other expenditures by the prohibited organizations in connection with elections, constitute violations of the provisions of said section, whether or not said expenditures are with or without the knowledge or consent of the candidates.\" Id., at 46. (Italics omitted.)\n\n\n Early in 1947 the Special Committee to Investigate Senatorial Campaign Expenditures in the 1946 elections, the Ellender Committee, urged similar action to \"plug the existing loophole,\" S. Rep. No. 1, Part 2, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 38-39, and Senator Ellender introduced a bill to that effect.\n\nShortly thereafter, Congress again acted to protect the political process from what it deemed to be the corroding effect of money employed in elections by aggregated power. Section 304 of the labor bill introduced into the House by Representative Hartley in 1947, like the Ellender bill, embodied the changes recommended in the reports of the Senate and House Committees on Campaign Expenditures. It sought to amend 313 of the Corrupt Practices Act to proscribe any \"expenditure\" as well \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 583]\n\u00a0\n as \"any contribution,\" to make permanent 313's application to labor organizations and to extend its coverage to federal primaries and nominating conventions. The Report of the House Committee on Education and Labor, which considered and approved the Hartley bill, merely summarized 304, H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 46, and this section gave rise to little debate in the House. See 93 Cong. Rec. 3428, 3522. Because no similar measure was in the labor bill introduced by Senator Taft, the Senate as a whole did not consider the provisions of 304 until they had been adopted by the Conference Committee. In explaining 304 to his colleagues, Senator Taft, who was one of the conferees, said:\n\n \"I may say that the amendment is in exactly the same words which were recommended by the Ellender committee, which investigated expenditures by Senators in the last election. . . . In this instance the words of the Smith-Connally Act have been somewhat changed in effect so as to plug up a loophole which obviously developed, and which, if the courts had permitted advantage to be taken of it, as a matter of fact, would absolutely have destroyed the prohibition against political advertising by corporations. If `contribution' does not mean `expenditure,' then a candidate for office could have his corporation friends publish an advertisement for him in the newspapers every day for a month before election. I do not think the law contemplated such a thing, but it was claimed that it did, at least when it applied to labor organizations. So, all we are doing here is plugging up the hole which developed, following the recommendation by our own Elections Committee, in the Ellender bill.\" 93 Cong. Rec. 6439. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 584]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n After considerable debate, the conference version was approved by the Senate, and the bill subsequently became law despite the President's veto. It is this section of the statute that the District Court held did not reach the activities alleged in the indictment.\n\nOn review under the Criminal Appeals Act of a district court judgment dismissing an indictment on the basis of statutory interpretation, this Court must take the indictment as it was construed by the district judge. United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188\n. The court below summarized the allegations of the indictment at the outset of its opinion:\n\n \"Here the specific charge is that the `expenditure' violation came in connection with the selection of candidates for a senator and representatives to the United States Congress during the 1954 primary and general elections. It is alleged that defendant paid a specific amount from its general treasury fund to Luckoff and Wayburn Productions. Detroit, Michigan, to defray the costs of certain television broadcasts sponsored by the Union from commercial television station WJBK.\n\n\n \"It is charged that the broadcasts urged and endorsed selection of certain persons to be candidates for representatives and senator to the Congress of the United States and included expressions of political advocacy intended by defendant to influence the electorate and to affect the results of the election.\n\n\n \"It is further charged that the fund used came from the Union's dues, was not obtained by voluntary political contributions or subscriptions from members of the Union, and was not paid for by advertising or sales.\" 138 F. Supp., at 54. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 585]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Thus, for our purposes, the indictment charged appellee with having used union dues to sponsor commercial television broadcasts designed to influence the electorate to select certain candidates for Congress in connection with the 1954 elections.\n\nTo deny that such activity, either on the part of a corporation or a labor organization, constituted an \"expenditure in connection with any [federal] election\" is to deny the long series of congressional efforts calculated to avoid the deleterious influences on federal elections resulting from the use of money by those who exercise control over large aggregations of capital. More particularly, this Court would have to ignore the history of the statute from the time it was first made applicable to labor organizations. As indicated by the reports of the Congressional Committees that investigated campaign expenditures, it was to embrace precisely the kind of indirect contribution alleged in the indictment that Congress amended 313 to proscribe \"expenditures.\" It is open to the Government to prove under this indictment activity by appellee that, except for an irrelevant difference in the medium of communication employed, is virtually indistinguishable from the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen's purchase of radio time to sponsor candidates or the Ohio C. I. O.'s general distribution of pamphlets to oppose Senator Taft. Because such conduct was claimed to be merely \"an expenditure [by the union] of its own funds to state its position to the world,\" the Senate and House Committees recommended and Congress enacted, as we have seen, the prohibition of \"expenditures\" as well as \"contributions\" to \"plug the existing loophole.\"\n\nAlthough not entitled to the same weight as these carefully considered committee reports, the Senate debate preceding the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act confirms \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 586]\n\u00a0\n what these reports demonstrate. A colloquy between Senator Taft and Senator Pepper dealt with the problem confronting us:\n\n \"Mr. PEPPER. Does what the Senator has said in the past also apply to a radio speech? If a national labor union, for example, should believe that it was in the public interest to elect the Democratic Party instead of the Republican Party, or vice versa, would it be forbidden by this proposed act to pay for any radio time, for anybody to make a speech that would express to the people the point of view of that organization?\n\n\n \"Mr. TAFT. If it contributed its own funds to get somebody to make the speech, I would say they would violate the law.\n\n\n \"Mr. PEPPER. If they paid for the radio time?\n\n\n \"Mr. TAFT. If they are simply giving the time, I would say not; I would say that is in the course of their regular business.\n\n\n \"Mr. PEPPER. What I mean is this: I was not assuming that the radio station was owned by the labor organization. Suppose that in the 1948 campaign, Mr. William Green, as president of the American Federation of Labor, should believe it to be in the interest of his membership to go on the radio and support one party or the other in the national election, and should use American Federation of Labor funds to pay for the radio time. Would that be an expenditure which is forbidden to a labor organization under the statute?\n\n\n \"Mr. TAFT. Yes.\" 93 Cong. Rec. 6439.\n\n\n The discussion that followed, while suggesting that difficult questions might arise as to whether or not a particular broadcast fell within the statute, buttresses the conclusion that 304 was understood to proscribe \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 587]\n\u00a0\n the expenditure of union dues to pay for commercial broadcasts that are designed to urge the public to elect a certain candidate or party.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 588]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnited States v. C. I. O., \n335 \nU.S. 106\n, presented a different situation. The decision in that case rested on the Court's reading of an indictment that charged defendants \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 589]\n\u00a0\n with having distributed only to union members or purchasers an issue, Vol. 10, No. 28, of \"The CIO News,\" a weekly newspaper owned and published by the C. I. O. That issue contained a statement by the C. I. O. president urging all members of the C. I. O. to vote for a certain candidate. Thus, unlike the union-sponsored political broadcast alleged in this case, the communication for which the defendants were indicted in C. I. O. was neither directed nor delivered to the public at large. The organization merely distributed its house organ to its own people. The evil at which Congress has struck in 313 is the use of corporation or union funds to influence the public at large to vote for a particular candidate or a particular party.\n\nOur holding that the District Court committed error when it dismissed the indictment for having failed to state an offense under the statute implies no disrespect for \"the cardinal rule of construction, that where the language of an act will bear two interpretations, equally obvious, that one which is clearly in accordance with the provisions of the constitution is to be preferred.\" Knights Templars' Indemnity Co. v. Jarman, \n187 \nU.S. 197, 205\n. The case before us does not call for its application. Here only one interpretation may be fairly derived from the relevant materials. The rule of construction to be invoked when constitutional problems lurk in an ambiguous statute does not permit disregard of what Congress commands.\n\nAppellee urges that if, as we hold, 18 U.S.C. 610 embraces the activity alleged in the indictment, it offends several rights guaranteed by the Constitution.\n2\n The Government \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 590]\n\u00a0\n replies that the actual restraint upon union political activity imposed by the statute is so narrowly limited that Congress did not exceed its powers to protect the political process from undue influence of large aggregations of capital and to promote individual responsibility for democratic government. Once more we are confronted with the duty of being mindful of the conditions under which we may enter upon the delicate process of constitutional adjudication.\n\nThe impressive lesson of history confirms the wisdom of the repeated enunciation, the variously expressed admonition, of self-imposed inhibition against passing on the validity of an Act of Congress \"unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.\" Burton v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 283, 295\n.\n3\n Observance of this principle makes for the minimum tension within our democratic political system where \"Scarcely any question arises. . . which does not become, sooner or later, a subject of judicial debate.\" 1 De Tocqueville, Democracy in America (4th Am. ed. 1843), 306.\n\nThe wisdom of refraining from avoidable constitutional pronouncements has been most vividly demonstrated on the rare occasions when the Court, forgetting \"the fallibility of the human judgment,\"\n4\n has departed from its own practice. The Court's failure in Dred Scott \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 591]\n\u00a0\n v. Sandford, 19 How. 393, \"to take the smooth handle for the sake of repose\" by disposing of the case solely upon \"the outside issue\" and the effects of its attempt \"to settle the agitation\" are familiar history.\n5\n Dred Scott does not stand alone. These exceptions have rightly been characterized as among the Court's notable \"self-inflicted wounds.\" Charles Evans Hughes, The Supreme Court of the United States, 50.\n\nClearly in this case it is not \"absolutely necessary to a decision,\" Burton v. United States, supra, to canvass the constitutional issues. The case came here under the Criminal Appeals Act because the District Court blocked the prosecution on the ground that the indictment failed to state an offense within 313 of the Corrupt Practices Act. Our reversal of the district judge's erroneous construction clears the way for the prosecution to proceed.\n\nRefusal to anticipate constitutional questions is peculiarly appropriate in the circumstances of this case. First of all, these questions come to us unillumined by the consideration of a single judge - we are asked to decide them in the first instance. Again, only an adjudication on the merits can provide the concrete factual setting that sharpens the deliberative process especially demanded for constitutional decision. Finally, by remanding the case \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 592]\n\u00a0\n for trial it may well be that the Court will not be called upon to pass on the questions now raised. Compare United States v. Petrillo, \n332 \nU.S. 1, 9\n et seq., with the subsequent adjudication on the merits in United States v. Petrillo, 75 F. Supp. 176.\n\nCounsel are prone to shape litigation, so far as it is within their control, in order to secure comprehensive rulings. This is true both of counsel for defendants and for the Government. Such desire on their part is not difficult to appreciate. But the Court has its responsibility. Matter now buried under abstract constitutional issues may, by the elucidation of a trial, be brought to the surface, and in the outcome constitutional questions may disappear. Allegations of the indictment hypothetically framed to elicit a ruling from this Court or based upon misunderstanding of the facts may not survive the test of proof. For example, was the broadcast paid for out of the general dues of the union membership or may the funds be fairly said to have been obtained on a voluntary basis? Did the broadcast reach the public at large or only those affiliated with appellee? Did it constitute active electioneering or simply state the record of particular candidates on economic issues? Did the union sponsor the broadcast with the intent to affect the results of the election? As Senator Taft repeatedly recognized in the debate on 304, prosecutions under the Act may present difficult questions of fact. See supra, pp. 585-587, n. 1. We suggest the possibility of such questions, not to imply answers to problems of statutory construction, but merely to indicate the covert issues that may be involved in this case.\n\nEnough has been said to justify withholding determination of the more or less abstract issues of constitutional law. Because the District Court's erroneous interpretation of the statute led it to stop the prosecution prematurely, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 593]\n\u00a0\n its judgment must be reversed and the case must be remanded to it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Mr. BARKLEY. Suppose a certain corporation, for instance, the corporation that makes Bayer aspirin, or Jergens lotion, or any other well-advertised product, employs a commentator to talk about various things, winding up with an advertisement of the product, and suppose that the radio commentator from day to day takes advantage of his employment or his sponsorship to make comments which are calculated to influence the opinions of men or women as to political candidates. Would the corporation sponsoring the particular commentator be violating the law?\n\n\"Mr. TAFT. I should have to know the exact facts. If, for instance, apart from commentators and the radio, and taking the case of a paid advertisement, suppose a corporation advertises its products, and that every day for 2 weeks before the election it advertises a candidate. I should say that would be a violation of the law. I would say the same thing probably would be true of a radio broadcast of that kind, under certain circumstances, but I think I should like to know the exact facts before expressing an opinion.\n\n\n\"Mr. BARKLEY. In the case of a commentator who is paid to advertise a certain product, and who in the course of his 15 minutes on the radio may also seek to influence votes, the sponsor may say, either before or after the broadcast, that he is not responsible for what the commentary says; yet he is paying the commentator for his broadcast. Would that still be a violation of law, although the sponsor might excuse himself or attempt to excuse himself by saying he was not responsible for the opinions expressed by the commentator?\n\n\n\"Mr. TAFT. I think there are all degrees. It would be for a court to decide. I think as a matter of fact, if that had happened under the old law, there would have been the same question.\n\n\n\"I want to make the point that we are not raising any new questions here. Those same questions could have been raised with respect to corporations during the past 25 years. It is a question of fact: Was the corporation using its money to influence a political election?\n\n\n .   .   .   .   .\n\n\"Mr. MAGNUSON. Let us consider the teamsters. Suppose they have a weekly radio program, as, indeed, they have had for a long time back. Or let us say the AFL has such a radio program. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 588]\n\u00a0\n Let us assume I am running for office and they ask me to be a guest on their program. Suppose I talk on the subject of labor and do not advocate my own candidacy. Nevertheless I am on that program. My name is being advertised and I am being heard by many thousands of people. Would that be an unlawful contribution to my candidacy?\n\n\n\"Mr. TAFT. If a labor organization is using the funds provided by its members through payment of union dues to put speakers on the radio for Mr. X against Mr. Y, that should be a violation of the law.\n\n\n\"Mr. MAGNUSON. They are not paying me anything. They have asked me to be a guest.\n\n\n\"Mr. TAFT. I understand, but they are paying for the time on the air. Of course, in each case there is a question of fact to be decided. I cannot answer various hypotheses without knowing all the circumstances. But in each case the question is whether or not a union or a corporation is making a contribution or expenditure of funds to elect A as against B. Labor unions are supposed to keep out of politics in the same way that corporations are supposed to keep out of politics.\" 93 Cong. Rec. 6439-6440.\n\n\n\"Mr. TAYLOR. . . . Take the matter of a radio program sponsored by either a union or a corporation. I think the AFL or the CIO, one or the other, has a news commentator who comments on the news. Could he comment on political candidates favorably or unfavorably?\n\n\n\"Mr. TAFT. If the General Motors Corp. had a man speaking on the radio every week to advocate the election of a Republican or a Democratic Presidential candidate, the corporation ought to be punished, and it would be punished under the law. Labor organizations should be subject to the same rule.\n\n\n\"Mr. TAYLOR. That is altogether different. It is a more subtle thing. When a commentator is broadcasting the news every day he can do a lot more good or harm to a man by coloring his broadcast and presenting it in the guise of a news commentary than he could openly.\n\n\n\"Mr. TAFT. The Senator is right. It is a question of fact which would have to be raised in every case. Is it a contribution to a candidate or is it not? Possibly a knock is a boost sometimes. That argument might well be made by a person who was taking part in an election.\" 93 Cong. Rec. 6447.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \". . . if such an expenditure is prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 610, the statute violates the provisions of the Constitution of the United States in that the statute (i) abridges freedom of speech and of the press and the right peaceably to assemble and to petition; (ii) abridges the right to choose senators and representatives guaranteed by Article I, 2 and the Seventeenth Amendment; (iii) creates an arbitrary and unlawful classification and discriminates against labor \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 590]\n\u00a0\n organizations in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and (iv) is vague and indefinite and fails to provide a reasonably ascertainable standard of guilt in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\" Brief for appellee, pp. 2-3.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cases are collected in the opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 345\n et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"It must be evident to any one that the power to declare a legislative enactment void is one which the judge, conscious of the fallibility of the human judgment, will shrink from exercising in any case where he can conscientiously and with due regard to duty and official oath decline the responsibility.\" 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th ed.), 332.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] A letter written by Mr. Justice Catron to President Buchanan shortly before the decision was handed down reveals an attitude happily exceptional:\n\n\"Will you drop [Mr. Justice] Grier a line, saying how necessary it is - & how good the opportunity is, to settle the agitation by an affirmative decision of the Supreme Court, the one way or the other. He ought not to occupy so doubtful a ground as the outside issue - that admitting the constitutionality of the Mo. Comp. line of 1820, still, as no domicile was acquired by the negro at Ft. Snelling, & he returned to Missouri, he was not free. He has no doubt about the question on the main contest, but has been persuaded to take the smooth handle for the sake of repose.\" 10 Works of James Buchanan 106.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK join, dissenting.\n\nWe deal here with a problem that is fundamental to the electoral process and to the operation of our democratic society. It is whether a union can express its views on the issues of an election and on the merits of the candidates, unrestrained and unfettered by the Congress. The principle at stake is not peculiar to unions. It is applicable as well to associations of manufacturers, retail and wholesale trade groups, consumers' leagues, farmers' unions, religious groups and every other association representing a segment of American life and taking an active part in our political campaigns and discussions. It is as important an issue as has come before the Court, for it reaches the very vitals of our system of government.\n\nUnder our Constitution it is We The People who are sovereign. The people have the final say. The legislators are their spokesmen. The people determine through their votes the destiny of the nation. It is therefore important - vitally important - that all channels of communication be open to them during every election, that no point of view be restrained or barred, and that the people have access to the views of every group in the community.\n\nIn United States v. C. I. O., \n335 \nU.S. 106, 144\n, Mr. Justice Rutledge spoke of the importance of the First Amendment rights - freedom of expression and freedom of assembly - to the integrity of our elections. \"The most complete exercise of those rights,\" he said, \"is essential to the full, fair and untrammeled operation of the electoral process. To the extent they are curtailed the \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 594]\n\u00a0\n electorate is deprived of information, knowledge and opinion vital to its function.\"\n\nWhat the Court does today greatly impairs those rights. It sustains an indictment charging no more than the use of union funds for broadcasting television programs that urge and endorse the selection of certain candidates for the Congress of the United States. The opinion of the Court places that advocacy in the setting of corrupt practices. The opinion generates an environment of evil-doing and points to the oppressions and misdeeds that have haunted elections in this country.\n\nMaking a speech endorsing a candidate for office does not, however, deserve to be identified with antisocial conduct. Until today political speech has never been considered a crime. The making of a political speech up to now has always been one of the preferred rights protected by the First Amendment. It usually costs money to communicate an idea to a large audience. But no one would seriously contend that the expenditure of money to print a newspaper deprives the publisher of freedom of the press. Nor can the fact that it costs money to make a speech - whether it be hiring a hall or purchasing time on the air - make the speech any the less an exercise of First Amendment rights. Yet this statute, as construed and applied in this indictment, makes criminal any \"expenditure\" by a union for the purpose of expressing its views on the issues of an election and the candidates. It would make no difference under this construction of the Act whether the union spokesman made his address from the platform of a hall, used a sound truck in the streets, or bought time on radio or television. In each case the mere \"expenditure\" of money to make the speech is an indictable offense. The principle applied today would make equally criminal the use by a union of its funds to print pamphlets for general distribution or to distribute political literature at large. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 595]\n\u00a0\n\n\nCan an Act so construed be constitutional in view of the command of the First Amendment that Congress shall make no law that abridges free speech or freedom of assembly?\n\nThe Court says that the answer on the constitutional issue must await the development of the facts at the trial.\n\nIt asks, \"Did the broadcast reach the public at large or only those affiliated with appellee?\" But the size of the audience has heretofore been deemed wholly irrelevant to First Amendment issues. One has a right to freedom of speech whether he talks to one person or to one thousand. One has a right to freedom of speech not only when he talks to his friends but also when he talks to the public. It is starting to learn that a union spokesman or the spokesman for a corporate interest has fewer constitutional rights when he talks to the public than when he talks to members of his group.\n\nThe Court asks whether the broadcast constituted \"active electioneering\" or simply stated \"the record of particular candidates on economic issues.\" What possible difference can it make under the First Amendment whether it was one or the other? The First Amendment covers the entire spectrum. It protects the impassioned plea of the orator as much as the quiet publication of the tabulations of the statistician or economist. If there is an innuendo that \"active electioneering\" by union spokesmen is not covered by the First Amendment, the opinion makes a sharp break with our political and constitutional heritage.\n\nThe Court asks, \"Did the union sponsor the broadcast with the intent to affect the results of the election?\" The purpose of speech is not only to inform but to incite to action. As Mr. Justice Holmes said in his dissent in Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 673\n, \"Every idea is an incitement. It offers itself for belief and if believed it \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 596]\n\u00a0\n is acted on unless some other belief outweighs it or some failure of energy stifles the movement at its birth.\" To draw a constitutional line between informing the people and inciting or persuading them and to suggest that one is protected and the other not by the First Amendment is to give constitutional dignity to an irrelevance. Any political speaker worth his salt intends to sway voters. His purpose to do so cannot possibly rob him of his First Amendment rights, unless we are to reduce that great guarantee of freedom to the protection of meaningless mouthings of ineffective speakers.\n\nFinally, the Court asks whether the broadcast was \"paid for out of the general dues of the union membership or may the funds be fairly said to have been obtained on a voluntary basis.\" Behind this question is the idea that there may be a minority of union members who are of a different political school than their leaders and who object to the use of their union dues to espouse one political view. This is a question that concerns the internal management of union affairs. To date, unions have operated under a rule of the majority. Perhaps minority rights need protection. But this way of doing it is, indeed, burning down the house to roast the pig. All union expenditures for political discourse are banned because a minority might object.\n\nWhen the exercise of First Amendment rights is tangled with conduct which government may regulate, we refuse to allow the First Amendment rights to be sacrificed merely because some evil may result. Our insistence is that the regulatory measure be \"narrowly drawn\" to meet the evil that the government can control. Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 311\n. Or as the Court said in De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353, 364\n-365, when speaking of First Amendment rights, \". . . the legislative intervention can find constitutional justification only by dealing \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 597]\n\u00a0\n with the abuse. The rights themselves must not be curtailed.\"\n\nIf minorities need protection against the use of union funds for political speech-making, there are ways of reaching that end without denying the majority their First Amendment rights.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nFirst Amendment rights are not merely curtailed by the construction of the Act which the Court adopts. Today's ruling abolishes First Amendment rights on a wholesale basis. Protection of minority groups, if any, can be no excuse. The Act is not \"narrowly drawn\" to meet that abuse.\n\nSome may think that one group or another should not express its views in an election because it is too powerful, because it advocates unpopular ideas, or because it has a record of lawless action. But these are not justifications for withholding First Amendment rights from any group - labor or corporate. Cf. United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n. First Amendment rights are part of the heritage of all persons and groups in this country. They are not to be dispensed or withheld merely because we or the Congress thinks the person or group is worthy or unworthy.\n\nThese constitutional questions are so grave that the least we should do is to construe this Act, as we have in comparable situations (United States v. C. I. O., supra; \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 598]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n; United States v. Harriss, \n347 \nU.S. 612\n), to limit the word \"expenditure\" to activity that does not involve First Amendment rights.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe Act, as construed and applied, is a broadside assault on the freedom of political expression guaranteed by the First Amendment. It cannot possibly be saved by any of the facts conjured up by the Court. The answers to the questions reserved are quite irrelevant to the constitutional questions tendered under the First Amendment.\n\nI would affirm the judgment dismissing the indictment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] There are alternative measures appropriate to cure this evil which Congress has seen in the expenditure of union funds for political purposes. The protection of union members from the use of their funds in supporting a cause with which they do not sympathize may be cured by permitting the minority to withdraw their funds from that activity. The English have long required labor unions to permit a dissenting union member to refuse to contribute funds for political purposes. Trade Union Act, 1913, 2 & 3 Geo. V, c. 30; Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act, 1927, 17 & 18 Geo. V, c. 22; Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act, 1946, 9 & 10 Geo. VI, c. 52.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] If Congress is of the opinion that large contributions by labor unions to candidates for office and to political parties have had an undue influence upon the conduct of elections, it can prohibit such contributions. And, in expressing their views on the issues and candidates, labor unions can be required to acknowledge their authorship and support of those expressions. Undue influence, however, cannot constitutionally form the basis for making it unlawful for any segment of our society to express its views on the issues of a political campaign. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 567, 599]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. CALAMARO(1957)\nNo. 304\nArgued: March 4, 1957Decided: June 17, 1957\n\n\n\n\n A so-called \"pick-up man\" in a type of lottery called the \"numbers game,\" who has no proprietary interest in the enterprise and acts merely as a messenger transmitting records of wagers from the \"writer\" (an agent who accepts wagers from the bettors) to the \"banker\" (the principal for whom the wagers are accepted), is not \"engaged in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person\" within the meaning of Subchapter B of Chapter 27 A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 3290, and, therefore, is not subject to the annual $50 special occupational tax imposed by that Subchapter. Pp. 351-360.\n\n 236 F.2d 182, affirmed.\n\nLeonard B. Sand argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and Julia P. Cooper.\n\nRaymond J. Bradley argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Edwin P. Rome.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question before us is whether the respondent, a so-called \"pick-up man\" in a type of lottery called the \"numbers game,\" is subject to the annual $50 special occupational tax enacted by Subchapter B of Chapter 27A (Wagering Taxes) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 65 Stat. 530, 26 U.S.C. 3285 et seq. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 352]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs will be seen from the statute, whose material parts are printed in the margin,\n1\n this Chapter of the 1939 Code enacts two kinds of wagering taxes: (1) An excise tax, imposed by 3285 (d) on persons \"engaged in the business of accepting wagers,\" and (2) a special occupational tax, imposed by 3290 not only on persons who are subject \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 353]\n\u00a0\n to the excise tax, being \"engaged in the business,\" but also on those who are \"engaged in receiving wagers\" on behalf of one subject to the excise tax. By definition the \"numbers game\" is among the wagering transactions included in the statute.\n\nAt the outset we must understand some professional gambling terminology which has been given us by the parties. A numbers game involves three principal functional types of individuals: (1) the \"banker,\" who deals in the numbers and against whom the player bets; (2) the \"writer,\" who, for the banker, does the actual selling of the numbers to the public, and who records on triplicate slips the numbers sold to each player and the amount of his wager; and (3) the \"pick-up man,\" who collects wagering slips\n2\n from the writer and delivers them to the banker. If there are winnings to be distributed, the banker delivers the required amount to the writer, who in turn pays off the successful players.\n\nThe respondent here was a pick-up man for a Philadelphia banker, receiving for his services a salary of $40 a week, but having no proprietary interest in this numbers \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 354]\n\u00a0\n enterprise. He was convicted, after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, of failing to pay the 3290 occupational tax, and was fined $1,000.\n3\n The Court of Appeals reversed by a divided court, 236 F.2d 182, and upon the Government's petition we granted certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 864\n, to resolve the conflict between the decision below and that of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Sagonias v. United States, 223 F.2d 146, as to the scope of 3290. For reasons given hereafter we consider that the Court of Appeals in this case took the correct view of this statute.\n\nThe nub of the Court of Appeals' holding was put in the following language, with which we agree:\n\n  \"In normal usage of familiar language, `receiving  wagers' is what someone on the `banking' side of  gambling does in dealing with a bettor. Placing and  receiving a wager are opposite sides of a single coin.  You can't have one without the other. [The court  here referred to the definition of \"wager\" contained  in 3285 (b) (1) (C); note 1, supra.] Before the  pick-up man enters the picture, in such a case as we  have here, the wager has been received physically  by the writer and, in legal contemplation, by the  writer's principal as well. The government recognizes  - and in an appropriate case no doubt would  insist - that what the writer does in relation to the  bettor amounts to `receiving a wager.' Thus, the  government has to argue that the wager is received  a second time when the writer hands the yellow slip  to the pick-up man. But we think this ignores the  very real difference between a wager and a record of  a wagering transaction. It is the banking record and \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 355]\n\u00a0\n  not the wager which the pick-up man receives from  the writer and transmits to the bank. The pick-up  man no more receives wagers than a messenger, who  carries records of customer transactions from a branch  bank to a central office, receives deposits.\" 236 F.2d  ___, at 184-185.\n\n\n We do not think that either the language or purpose of this statute, as revealed by its legislative history, supports the position of the Government. When the phrase \"receiving wagers\" is read in conjunction with 3285 (b) (1), which defines \"wager\" in terms of the \"placing\" of a bet in connection with any of the kinds of wagering transactions embraced in the statute,\n4\n it seems evident that the Court of Appeals was quite correct in regarding the \"placing\" and \"receiving\" of a wager as being \"opposite sides of a single coin.\"\n5\n In other words, we think that as used in 3290 the term \"receiving\" a wager is synonymous with \"accepting\" a wager;\n6\n that it is the making of a gambling contract, not the transportation of a piece of paper, to which the statute refers; and hence that, in such a case as this, it is the writer and not the pick-up man who is \"engaged in receiving wagers\" within the meaning of 3290. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 356]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe consider the legislative history of the statute, such as it is, to be fully consistent with this interpretation of 3290. In the Senate and House Reports on the bill, it is stated:\n\n \". . . A person is considered to be in the business of  accepting wagers if he is engaged as a principal who,  in accepting wagers, does so on his own account.  The principals in such transactions are commonly  referred to as `bookmakers,' although it is not  intended that any technical definition of `bookmaker,'  such as the maintenance of a handbook or other  device for the recording of wagers, be required. It  is intended that a wager be considered as `placed' with  a principal when it has been placed with another  person acting for him. Persons who receive bets for  principals are sometimes known as `bookmakers'  agents' or as `runners.' . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n  \"As in the case of bookmaking transactions, a  wager will be considered as `placed' in a pool or in a  lottery whether placed directly with the person who  conducts the pool or lottery or with another person  acting for such a person.\" H. R. Rep. No. 586, 82d  Cong., 1st Sess. 56; S. Rep. No. 781, 82d Cong., 1st  Sess. 114 (emphasis added).\n\n\n Again, in the case of a numbers game, this indicates that Congress regarded the \"placing\" of a wager as being complemented by its \"receipt\" by the banker or by one acting for him in that transaction, that is, the writer and not the pick-up man.\n\nNor, contrary to what the Government contends, can we see anything in the registration provisions of 3291 which points to the pick-up man as being considered a \"receiver\" of wagers. Those provisions simply provide that one liable for any tax imposed by the statute must \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 357]\n\u00a0\n register his name and address with the collector of the district, and require in addition, (a) as to those subject to the 3285 excise tax, the registration of the name and address \"of each person who is engaged in receiving wagers for him or on his behalf,\" and (b) as to those subject to the 3290 occupational tax, the registration of the name and address of each person for whom they are \"engaged in receiving wagers.\"\n7\n It is doubtless true that these provisions, as well as the occupational tax itself,\n8\n were designed at least in part to facilitate collection of the excise tax. It is likewise plausible to suppose, as the Government suggests, that the more participants in a gambling enterprise are swept within these provisions, the more likely it is that information making possible the collection of excise taxes will be secured. The fact remains, however, that Congress did not choose to subject all employees of gambling enterprises to the tax and reporting requirements, but was content to impose them on persons actually \"engaged in receiving wagers.\" Neither we nor the Commissioner may rewrite the statute simply because we may feel that the scheme it creates could be improved upon.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 358]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe can give no weight to the Government's suggestion that holding the pick-up man to be not subject to this tax will defeat the policy of the statute because its enactment was \"in part motivated by a congressional desire to suppress wagering.\"\n10\n The statute was passed, and its constitutionality was upheld, as a revenue measure, United States v. Kahriger, \n345 \nU.S. 22\n, and, apart from all else, in construing it we would not be justified in resorting to collateral motives or effects which, standing apart from the federal taxing power, might place the constitutionality of the statute in doubt. See id., at 31.\n\nFinally, the Government points to the fact that the Treasury Regulations relating to the statute purport to include the pick-up man among those subject to the 3290 tax,\n11\n and argues (a) that this constitutes an administrative interpretation to which we should give weight in construing the statute, particularly because (b) section 3290 was carried over in haec verba into 4411 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. We find neither argument persuasive. In light of the above discussion, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 359]\n\u00a0\n we cannot but regard this Treasury Regulation as no more than an attempted addition to the statute of something which is not there.\n12\n As such the regulation can furnish no sustenance to the statute. Koshland v. Helvering, \n298 \nU.S. 441, 446\n-447. Nor is the Government helped by its argument as to the 1954 Code. The regulation had been in effect for only three years,\n13\n and there is nothing to indicate that it was ever called to the attention of Congress. The re-enactment of 3290 in the 1954 Code was not accompanied by any congressional discussion which throws light on its intended scope. In such circumstances we consider the 1954 re-enactment to be without significance. Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., \n348 \nU.S. 426\n,431.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot accept the alternative reasoning of the dissenting judge below who, relying on that part of the opinion in Daley v. United States, 231 F.2d 123, 128, relating to the trial court's charge to the jury in a prosecution for failing to pay the 3285 excise tax,\n14\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 360]\n\u00a0\n regarded the respondent's conviction here as sustainable also on the theory that he was a person \"engaged in the business of accepting wagers\" within the meaning of 3285 (d). The Government disclaims this ground for upholding the respondent's conviction, as indeed it must, in light of the unambiguous legislative history showing that the excise tax applies only to one who is \"engaged in the business of accepting wagers\" as a \"principal . . . on his own account.\"\n15\n In this instance, that means the banker, as the Government concedes.\n\nWe hold, therefore, that the occupational tax imposed by 3290 does not apply to this respondent as a pick-up man, and that the judgment below must accordingly be\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  \"SUBCHAPTER A - TAX ON WAGERS \"SEC. 3285.

No. 781, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 118 (1951).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] We do not consider as illuminating, on the issue before us, the statement in the House and Senate Reports cited in note 8, supra, to the effect that \"Enforcement of a tax on wagers frequently will necessitate the tracing of transactions through complex business relationships, thus requiring the identification of the various steps involved.\" This general statement, not necessarily referring to the numbers game or to mere delivery systems, as distinguished from arrangements for the \"lay-off\" of bets by gambling principals, is not helpful in interpreting 3290 in relation to the numbers game and \"pick-up men.\" Cf. Federal Communications Commission v. Columbia Broadcasting System of Calif., Inc., \n311 \nU.S. 132, 136\n. We think the same is true of the statements of Representative Reed, 97 \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 358]\n\u00a0\n Cong. Rec. 6896, and of Senator Kefauver, 97 Cong. Rec. 12231-12232, relied on by the Government. The significance of Senator Kefauver's statement is further limited by the fact that he was an opponent of the bill. See Mastro Plastics Corp. v. Labor Board, \n350 \nU.S. 270, 288\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See 97 Cong. Rec. 6892, 12236, referred to in United States v. Kahriger, \n345 \nU.S. 22, 27\n, n. 3.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Treas. Reg. 132, 325.41, Example 2 (26 CFR, 1957 Cum. Pocket Supp.), which was issued on November 1, 1951 (16 Fed. Reg. 11211, 11222), provides as follows: \"B operates a numbers game. He has an arrangement with ten persons, who are employed in various capacities, such as bootblacks, elevator operators, news dealers, etc., to receive wagers from the public on his behalf. B also employs a person to collect from his agents the wagers received on his behalf. \"B, his ten agents, and the employee who collects the wagers received on his behalf are each liable for the special tax.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Apart from this, the force of this Treasury Regulation as an aid to the interpretation of the statute is impaired by its own internal inconsistency. Thus, while Example 2 of that regulation purports to make the pick-up man liable for the 3290 occupational tax, Example 1 of the same regulation provides that \"a secretary and bookkeeper\" of one \"engaged in the business of accepting horse race bets\" are not liable for the occupational tax \"unless they also receive wagers\" for the person so engaged in business, although those who \"receive wagers by telephone\" are so liable. Thus in this instance a distinction seems to be drawn between the \"acceptance\" of the wager, and its \"receipt\" for recording purposes. But if this be proper, it is not apparent why the same distinction is not also valid between a writer, who \"accepts\" or \"receives\" a bet from a numbers player, and a pick-up man, who simply \"receives\" a copy of the slips on which the writer has recorded the bet, and passes it along to the banker.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See note 11, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] See the dissenting judge's opinion below, 236 F.2d 182, 185-186. The sufficiency of the instructions to the jury in Daley apparently \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 360]\n\u00a0\n was not challenged on appeal. In any event, the Daley case was not concerned with a pick-up man, nor was the legislative history quoted at p. 356, supra, brought to the court's attention. The court in the Sagonias case, supra, which accepted the Government's contention as to the meaning of \"receiving wagers,\" rejected the construction of the statute embodied in the instructions to the jury quoted in Daley.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See p. 356, supra.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, dissenting.\n\nFor the reasons stated in Sagonias v. United States, 223 F.2d 146, I believe that the respondent pickup man was \"engaged in receiving wagers for and on behalf\" of the banker, within the meaning of 3290 and 3291 (a) (3), and therefore was required to pay the occupational tax and to register not only his name and place of residence, but that of the banker. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 361]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe language of 3290 does not limit the occupational tax to persons \"accepting wagers\" in a contractual sense. Instead, it imposes the tax on \"each person . . . who is engaged in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person so liable [for the excise tax].\" Those words readily include a pickup man for he is engaged in receiving for the banker the slips which provide the banker with the sole evidence of the wagers made.\n\nThe legislative history contains specific references that indicate that the section was to apply to bookmakers' agents or runners.\n1\n It shows that the occupational tax was enacted not only as a revenue measure on its own account, but as a measure to help enforce the much larger excise tax placed by 3285 upon the principal operator of the gambling enterprise.\n2\n To this end, 3291 (a) (1) and (3) requires each person who is subject to the occupational tax to register not only his own name and place of residence, but also that of the person for whom he is receiving wagers. Registration of the pickup man aids the Government in tracking these gambling operations to their headquarters and is essential to the enforcement of the excise tax. Since the \"receiving wagers\" phrase in the registration provisions includes the pickup man, it must have the same meaning in the identical provisions imposing the occupational tax.\n\nFurthermore, the administrative interpretation of 3290 is significant. Since the enactment of the section \n\n[354 \nU.S. 351, 362]\n\u00a0\n in 1951, there has been in effect the following explanation of its scope in Treasury Regulations 132:\n\n  \"Example (2). B. operates a numbers game. He  has an arrangement with ten persons, who are employed  in various capacities, such as bootblacks, elevator  operators, news dealers, etc., to receive wagers  from the public on his behalf. B also employs a  person to collect from his agents the wagers received  on his behalf.\n\n\n  \"B, his ten agents, and the employee who collects  the wagers received on his behalf are each liable for  the special tax.\" (Emphasis supplied.) 26 CFR,  1957 Cum. Pocket Supp., 325.41.\n\n\n This regulation should not be disregarded unless shown to be plainly inconsistent with the statute. Commissioner v. Wheeler, \n324 \nU.S. 542, 547\n; Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 336\n. Moreover, Congress re-enacted 3290 in 1954 as 26 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 4411. It thus impliedly accepted this established interpretation of the scope of the section.

CARTER(1957)\nNo. 48\nArgued: December 5, 1956Decided: April 29, 1957\n\n\n\n\n As required by the Miller Act, a contractor who had a contract with the United States for the construction of federal buildings furnished a payment bond with a surety. The collective-bargaining contract under which employees of the contractor were hired obligated the contractor to pay them wages at specified rates and, in addition, to pay 7 1\/2 cents per hour of their labor to the trustees of a health and welfare fund established for their benefit and that of other construction workers. When the contractor failed to pay in full the required contributions to the health and welfare fund, the trustees of the fund sued (in the name of the United States) the surety to recover the balance due the fund, plus liquidated damages, attorney's fees, court costs and expenses. Held: The surety was liable under 2 (a) of the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. 270a. Pp. 211-221.\n\n (a) The surety's liability on a Miller Act bond must be at least coextensive with the obligations imposed by the Act if the bond is to have its intended effect. Pp. 215-216.\n\n\n (b) In this case, the trustees' rights against the surety depend upon, and are to be measured by, the applicable provisions of 2 (a) of the Act. P. 216.\n\n\n (c) The Miller Act is to be given a liberal construction to effectuate its protective purposes. P. 216.\n\n\n (d) The essence of the policy of the Miller Act is to provide a surety who, by force of the Act, must make good the obligations of a defaulting contractor to his suppliers of labor and material. Pp. 216-217.\n\n\n (e) The Miller Act does not limit recovery on the statutory bond to \"wages.\" P. 217.\n\n\n (f) The contractor's employees will not have been \"paid in full\" for their labor in accordance with the collective-bargaining agreements until the required contributions to the health and welfare fund have been made. Pp. 217-218.\n\n\n (g) The contractor's obligation to contribute to the fund was covered by the statutory bond, even though that obligation was not \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 211]\n\u00a0\n set forth in the construction contract with the United States but appeared only in the master labor agreements. P. 218.\n\n\n (h) In the circumstances here, the trustees stand in the shoes of the employees and are entitled to enforce their rights. Pp. 218-220.\n\n\n (i) The trustees of the fund have an even better right to sue on the bond than does the usual assignee, since they are claiming recovery for the sole benefit of beneficiaries of the fund, and those beneficiaries are the very ones who have performed the labor. P. 220.\n\n\n (j) For purposes of the Miller Act, contributions to the fund are in substance as much \"justly due\" to the employees who have earned them as are the wages paid to them directly in cash. P. 220.\n\n\n (k) The trustees are also entitled, under the Act, to recover liquidated damages, attorneys' fees, court costs, and other related expenses of this litigation, since these items must be included if the employees are to be \"paid in full\" the \"sums justly due\" them.

Dinkelspiel argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was John W. Dinkelspiel.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case concerns the extent of the liability of the surety on a payment bond furnished by a contractor, as required by the Miller Act, for the protection of persons supplying labor for the construction of federal public buildings.\n1\n The collective-bargaining contract under \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 212]\n\u00a0\n which the laborers were hired obligated the contractor to pay them wages at specified rates and, in addition, to pay 7 1\/2 cents per hour of their labor to the trustees of a health and welfare fund established for their benefit and that of other construction workers. When the contractor failed \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 213]\n\u00a0\n to pay in full the required contributions to the health and welfare fund, the trustees of the fund sued the surety on the contractor's payment bond to recover the balance due the fund, plus liquidated damages, attorneys' fees, court costs and expenses. For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that 2 (a) of the Miller Act imposes liability on the surety.\n\nIn November 1952, the respondent contractor, Donald G. Carter, contracted with the United States to construct certain public buildings at Air Force bases in California. As required by the Miller Act, he filed performance and payment bonds executed by the respondent, Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, as surety. The payment bond was in the penal sum of $52,434.30, and provided that the obligation of the surety shall be void \"if the principal shall promptly make payment to all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract . . . otherwise to remain in full force . . . .\"\n\nThe terms under which Carter employed laborers for the prosecution of the work were prescribed in master labor agreements governing the conditions of employment in the construction industry in 46 counties of northern California. Those agreements had been negotiated in June 1952 through collective bargaining between the local council of a labor union representing construction workers and several associations of employers, one of which acted as an agent for Carter. The agreements obligated Carter to pay wages to his employees at specified rates which were to be not less than the prevailing rates determined by the Government. The agreements required also that, beginning February 1, 1953, Carter was to pay to the trustees of a health and welfare fund 7 1\/2 cents for each hour worked by his construction employees.\n\nThe specified fund was established by a trust agreement dated March 4, 1953, and negotiated by the parties \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 214]\n\u00a0\n to the master labor agreements. Its pertinent provisions were as follows: The fund was to be administered by a board of trustees representing employers and employees. The trustees were authorized to use employer contributions to purchase various types of insurance, such as life, accidental death, hospitalization and surgical benefit policies, with eligible employees and their dependents as the beneficiaries.\n2\n The employees had no rights to the insurance benefits except as provided in the policies. Also, they had no right, title or interest in the contributions, and it was expressly stated that the contributions \"shall not constitute or be deemed to be wages\" due the employees.\n\nThe trustees had the sole power to demand and enforce prompt payment of employer contributions. Those contributions were payable in monthly installments. Any installment not paid by the 25th of the month in which it came due was delinquent, and the sum of $20 per delinquency or 10% of the amount due, whichever was greater, was owed by the delinquent employer as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. If the trustees filed suit to secure payment of any installments, the defaulting employer was to pay the reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and all other reasonable expenses of the trustees incurred in the litigation.\n\nCarter became insolvent after completing the construction work and paying his employees the wages payable \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 215]\n\u00a0\n directly to them. However, he failed to make his required contributions to the fund for February, March and April 1953. Pursuant to 2 (b) of the Miller Act, the trustees of the fund, in the name of the United States, instituted this action on the payment bond against Carter and his surety in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint sought recovery of the unpaid contributions and the prescribed liquidated damages, attorneys' fees, court costs and expenses, in the total amount of about $500. The facts were stipulated and the court, after hearing, granted the surety's motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the trustees had no right to sue on the bond under 2 (a) of the Act, since they were neither persons who had furnished labor or material, nor were they seeking sums \"justly due\" such persons. 229 F.2d 645. We granted certiorari to resolve the questions of statutory construction which are at issue. \n351 \nU.S. 917\n.\n\nSection 1 (a) (2) of the Miller Act provides that before any contract exceeding $2,000 for the construction of any public work of the United States is awarded to any person, such person shall furnish to the United States a payment bond with a satisfactory surety \"for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract . . . .\" 49 Stat. 793, 40 U.S.C. 270a (2). Section 2 (a), which is at issue here, provides that \"Every person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract . . . and who has not been paid in full therefor . . . shall have the right to sue on such payment bond . . . for the sum or sums justly due him . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) 49 Stat. 794, 40 U.S.C. 270b (a).\n\nThe surety's liability on a Miller Act bond must be at least coextensive with the obligations imposed by the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 216]\n\u00a0\n Act if the bond is to have its intended effect. The bond involved here was furnished to meet the statutory requirements of the Act and appears, on its face, to comply with these requirements. There is no indication that the coverage of the bond was intended to exceed them. The bond insures prompt payment \"to all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract . . . .\" The trustees' rights against the surety depend upon, and are to be measured by, the applicable provisions of 2 (a) of the Act.\n\nWhile the precise questions of statutory construction now presented are ones of first impression, prior decisions of this Court construing the Miller Act of 1935 and its predecessor, the Heard Act of 1894,\n3\n indicate that the Miller Act should receive a liberal construction to effectuate its protective purposes.\n\n  \"The Miller Act, like the Heard Act, is highly  remedial in nature. It is entitled to a liberal construction  and application in order properly to effectuate  the Congressional intent to protect those whose  labor and materials go into public projects. Fleisher  Engineering Co. v. United States, \n311 \nU.S. 15, 17\n,  18; cf. United States v. Irwin, \n316 \nU.S. 23, 29\n, 30.  But such a salutary policy does not justify ignoring  plain words of limitation and imposing wholesale  liability on payment bonds.\" Clifford F. MacEvoy  Co. v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 102, 107\n.\n\n\n The Miller Act represents a congressional effort to protect persons supplying labor and material for the construction of federal public buildings in lieu of the protection they might receive under state statutes with respect to the construction of nonfederal buildings. The \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 217]\n\u00a0\n essence of its policy is to provide a surety who, by force of the Act, must make good the obligations of a defaulting contractor to his suppliers of labor and material. Thus the Act provides a broad but not unlimited protection.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIt is undisputed that if the collective-bargaining agreement had required the contractor to pay each employee 7 1\/2 cents per hour above the prevailing wage rate, and the employee had, by contract with his bargaining representative, agreed to contribute that sum to the fund, the surety would have been obligated to make good any default in the contractor's payment of that extra 7 1\/2 cents per hour. The surety argues that employer contributions made directly to a health and welfare fund should be treated differently. It contends that, under the provisions of the trust agreement, the unpaid contributions are not \"wages\" due to Carter's employees, and that the employees, having received all the \"wages\" owed to them, have been \"paid in full\" as that term is used in 2 (a) of the Act. The Act, however, does not limit recovery on the statutory bond to \"wages.\" The parties have stipulated that contributions to the fund were part of the consideration Carter agreed to pay for the services of laborers on his construction jobs. The unpaid contributions were a part of the compensation for the work to be done by \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 218]\n\u00a0\n Carter's employees. The relation of the contributions to the work done is emphasized by the fact that their amount was measured by the exact number of hours each employee performed services for Carter. Not until the required contributions have been made will Carter's employees have been \"paid in full\" for their labor in accordance with the collective-bargaining agreements.\n\nThe surety suggests that Carter's obligation to contribute to the fund was not covered by the statutory bond because that obligation was not set forth in his construction contract with the United States, but appeared only in the master labor agreements. Those labor agreements were also the source of Carter's obligation to pay the \"wages\" payable directly to his employees, an obligation concededly guaranteed by the bond. Nothing in the Miller Act restricted the obligations of the surety to what was set forth specifically in Carter's agreement with the United States. In fact, the surety's obligations extended to some persons who had no contractual relationship with Carter. For example, persons who contributed labor and material to Carter's subcontractors were entitled to the Act's protection. See the MacEvoy Co. case, supra, at 105, 107-108. As long as Carter's obligations relating to compensation for labor have not been satisfied, his employees will not have been \"paid in full\" and the Miller Act will not have served its purpose.\n\nThe surety also argues that the trustees are not entitled to recover the promised contributions under 2 (a) of the Miller Act, since they are neither persons who have furnished labor or material, nor are they seeking \"sums justly due\" to persons who have furnished labor or material. An answer to this contention is found in cases arising under the Heard Act involving suits by assignees of the claims of persons furnishing labor or material. Such assignees were not the persons who had furnished the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 219]\n\u00a0\n labor or material for which the claims were made. They did not seek \"sums justly due\" to persons who had themselves furnished labor or material, since the assignments had extinguished the right which those persons had to the performance of the contractors' obligation.\n5\n Yet these cases established that assignees of the claims of persons furnishing labor or material came within the protection of the statutory bond.\n6\n It was pointed out that a denial of an assignee's right to sue on the bond might deprive those for whom the security was intended of a fair chance to realize upon their claims by assignment.\n7\n There is nothing in the language, legislative history, or related decisions to indicate that Congress intended to overturn these cases when it replaced the Heard Act with the broader and more liberal provisions of the Miller Act.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIf the assignee of an employee can sue on the bond, the trustees of the employees' fund should be able to do so. Whether the trustees of the fund are, in a technical sense, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 220]\n\u00a0\n assignees of the employees' rights to the contributions need not be decided. Suffice it to say that the trustees' relationship to the employees, as established by the master labor agreements and the trust agreement, is closely analogous to that of an assignment. The master labor agreements not only created Carter's obligation to make the specified contributions, but simultaneously created the right of the trustees to collect those contributions on behalf of the employees. The trust agreement gave the trustees the exclusive right to enforce payment. The trustees stand in the shoes of the employees and are entitled to enforce their rights.\n\nMoreover, the trustees of the fund have an even better right to sue on the bond than does the usual assignee since they are not seeking to recover on their own account. The trustees are claiming recovery for the sole benefit of the beneficiaries of the fund, and those beneficiaries are the very ones who have performed the labor. The contributions are the means by which the fund is maintained for the benefit of the employees and of other construction workers. For purposes of the Miller Act, these contributions are in substance as much \"justly due\" to the employees who have earned them as are the wages payable directly to them in cash.\n\nThe trustees' claim for liquidated damages, attorneys' fees, court costs and other related expenses of this litigation has equal merit. The contractor's obligation to pay these items is set forth in the trust agreement. It is stipulated that they form a part of the consideration which Carter agreed to pay for services performed by his employees. If the employees are to be \"paid in full\" the \"sums justly due\" to them, these items must be included. Their amount, however, remains to be determined.\n\nWe hold that the Miller Act makes the surety liable on its payment bond for the delinquent contributions to the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 210, 221]\n\u00a0\n fund, together with the additional items above described. The judgment of the Court of Appeals, therefore, is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further action consistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \". . .

DU PONT & CO.(1957)\nNo. 169\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1957\n\n\n\n\n This is a civil action brought by the Government in 1949 under 15 of the Clayton Act to enjoin violations of 7 of that Act resulting from the purchase by du Pont in 1917-1919 of a 23% stock interest in General Motors. The essence of the charge was that, by means of the close relationship of the two companies, du Pont had obtained an illegal preference over competitors in the sale of automotive finishes and fabrics to General Motors, thus tending to \"create a monopoly\" in a \"line of commerce.\" After trial, the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the Government had failed to prove its case, and the Government appealed directly to this Court. Held: The Government proved a violation of 7; the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for a determination, after further hearing, of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the stock acquisition offensive to the statute. Pp. 588-608.\n\n (a) Any acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of another corporation, competitor or not, was within the reach of 7 before its amendment in 1950 whenever there was reasonable likelihood that the acquisition would result in a restraint of commerce or in the creation of a monopoly of any \"line of commerce\" - i. e., it applied to vertical as well as horizontal stock acquisitions. Pp. 590-593.\n\n\n (b) Failure of the Federal Trade Commission to invoke 7 against vertical stock acquisitions is not a binding administrative interpretation that Congress did not intend vertical acquisitions to come within the purview of the Act. P. 590.\n\n\n (c) The record shows that automotive finishes and fabrics have sufficient peculiar characteristics and uses to constitute them products sufficiently distinct from all other finishes and fabrics to make them a \"line of commerce\" within the meaning of the Clayton Act. Therefore, the bounds of the relevant market for the purposes of this case are not coextensive with the total market for finishes and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 587]\n\u00a0\n fabrics, but are coextensive with the automobile industry, the relevant market for automotive finishes and fabrics. Pp. 593-595.\n\n\n (d) The record shows that quantitatively and percentagewise du Pont supplies the largest part of General Motors' requirements of finishes and fabrics. Therefore, du Pont has a substantial share of the relevant market. Pp. 595-596.\n\n\n (e) The test of a violation is whether, at the time of suit, there is a reasonable probability that the stock acquisition may lead to a restraint of commerce or tend to create a monopoly of a line of commerce. Therefore, the Government may maintain this suit, brought in 1949, based upon an acquisition of stock which occurred in 1917-1919. Pp. 596-607.\n\n\n (f) Even when a purchase of stock is solely for investment, the plain language of 7 contemplates an action at any time the stock is used to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, a substantial lessening of competition. Pp. 597-598.\n\n\n (g) On the record in this case, the background of the acquisition and the plain implications of the contemporaneous documents eliminate any basis for a conclusion that the purchase was made \"solely for investment.\" Pp. 598-602.\n\n\n (h) The bulk of du Pont's production of automotive finishes and fabrics has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of General Motors, the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du Pont by a stock interest; and there is an overwhelming inference that du Pont's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit. Pp. 600-605.\n\n\n (i) It is not requisite to the proof of a violation of 7 to show that restraint or monopoly was intended. P. 607.\n\n\n 126 F. Supp. 235, reversed and remanded.\n\nJohn F.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a direct appeal under 2 of the Expediting Act\n1\n from a judgment of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,\n2\n dismissing the Government's action brought in 1949 under 15 of the Clayton Act.\n3\n The complaint alleged a violation of 7 of the Act\n4\n resulting from the purchase by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company in 1917-1919 of a 23% stock interest in General Motors Corporation. This appeal is from the dismissal of the action as to du Pont, General Motors and the corporate holders of large amounts of du Pont stock, Christiana Securities Corporation and Delaware Realty & Investment Company.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe primary issue is whether du Pont's commanding position as General Motors' supplier of automotive \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 589]\n\u00a0\n finishes and fabrics was achieved on competitive merit alone, or because its acquisition of the General Motors' stock, and the consequent close intercompany relationship, led to the insulation of most of the General Motors' market from free competition, with the resultant likelihood, at the time of suit, of the creation of a monopoly of a line of commerce.\n\nThe first paragraph of 7, pertinent here, provides:\n\n \"That no corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation, but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which, as a reasonable probability, appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation. The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies, or the substantial lessening of competition, have occurred or are intended. Acquisitions solely for investment are excepted, but only if, and so long as, the stock is not used by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, the substantial lessening of competition. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 590]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are met at the threshold with the argument that 7, before its amendment in 1950, applied only to an acquisition of the stock of a competing corporation, and not to an acquisition by a supplier corporation of the stock of a customer corporation - in other words, that the statute applied only to horizontal and not to vertical acquisitions. This is the first case presenting the question in this Court. International Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n280 \nU.S. 291\n, and Thatcher Mfg. Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n272 \nU.S. 554\n, involved corporate acquisitions of stock of competitors.\n\nDuring the 35 years before this action was brought, the Government did not invoke 7 against vertical acquisitions. The Federal Trade Commission has said that the section did not apply to vertical acquisitions. See F. T. C., Report on Corporate Mergers and Acquisitions, 168 (1955), H. R. Doc. No. 169, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. Also, the House Committee considering the 1950 revision of 7 stated that \". . . it has been thought by some that this legislation [the 1914 Act] applies only to the so-called horizontal mergers. . . .\" H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 11. The House Report adds, however, that the 1950 amendment was purposed \". . . to make it clear that the bill applies to all types of mergers and acquisitions, vertical and conglomerate as well as horizontal . . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nThis Court has the duty to reconcile administrative interpretations with the broad antitrust policies laid down by Congress. Cf. Automatic Canteen Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n346 \nU.S. 61, 74\n. The failure of the Commission to act is not a binding administrative interpretation that Congress did not intend vertical acquisitions to come within the purview of the Act. Accord, Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Jackson, \n353 \nU.S. 325, 331\n.\n\nThe first paragraph of 7, written in the disjunctive, plainly is framed to reach not only the corporate acquisition \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 591]\n\u00a0\n of stock of a competing corporation, where the effect may be substantially to lessen competition between them, but also the corporate acquisition of stock of any corporation, competitor or not, where the effect may be either (1) to restrain commerce in any section or community, or (2) tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce. The amended complaint does not allege that the effect of du Pont's acquisition may be to restrain commerce in any section or community but alleges that the effect was \". . . to tend to create a monopoly in particular lines of commerce . . . .\"\n\nSection 7 contains a second paragraph dealing with a holding company's acquisition of stock in two or more corporations.\n7\n Much of the legislative history of the section deals with the alleged holding company evil.\n8\n This history does not aid in interpretation because our concern here is with the first paragraph of the section. There is, however, pertinent legislative history which does aid and support our construction.\n\nSenator Chilton, one of the Senate managers of the bill, explained that the House conferees insisted that to prohibit just the acquisitions where the effect was \"substantially\" to lessen competition would not accomplish the designed aim of the statute, because \"a corporation might acquire the stock of another corporation, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 592]\n\u00a0\n and there would be no lessening of competition, but the tendency might be to create monopoly or to restrain trade or commerce.\" \"Therefore,\" said Senator Chilton, \"there was added . . . the following: `Or to restrain such commerce in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce.'\"\n9\n This construction of the section, as embracing three separate and distinct effects of a stock acquisition, has also been recognized by a number of federal courts.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nWe hold that any acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of another corporation, competitor or not, is within the reach of the section whenever the reasonable likelihood appears that the acquisition will result in a restraint of commerce or in the creation of a monopoly of any line of commerce. Thus, although du Pont and General Motors are not competitors, a violation of the section has occurred if, as a result of the acquisition, there was at the time of suit a reasonable likelihood of a monopoly of any line of commerce. Judge Maris correctly stated in Transamerica Corp. v. Board of Governors, 206 F.2d 163, 169:\n\n \"A monopoly involves the power to . . . exclude competition when the monopolist desires to do so. Obviously, under Section 7 it was not necessary . . . to find that . . . [the defendant] has actually achieved monopoly power but merely that the stock acquisitions under attack have brought it measurably closer to that end. For it is the purpose of the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 593]\n\u00a0\n Clayton Act to nip monopoly in the bud. Since by definition monopoly involves the power to eliminate competition a lessening of competition is clearly relevant in the determination of the existence of a tendency to monopolize. Accordingly in order to determine the existence of a tendency to monopoly in . . . any . . . line of business the area or areas of existing effective competition in which monopoly power might be exercised must first be determined. . . .\"\n\n\n Appellees argue that there exists no basis for a finding of a probable restraint or monopoly within the meaning of 7 because the total General Motors market for finishes and fabrics constituted only a negligible percentage of the total market for these materials for all uses, including automotive uses. It is stated in the General Motors brief that in 1947 du Pont's finish sales to General Motors constituted 3.5% of all sales of finishes to industrial users, and that its fabrics sales to General Motors comprised 1.6% of the total market for the type of fabric used by the automobile industry.\n\nDetermination of the relevant market is a necessary predicate to a finding of a violation of the Clayton Act because the threatened monopoly must be one which will substantially lessen competition \"within the area of effective competition.\"\n11\n Substantiality can be determined only in terms of the market affected. The record shows that automotive finishes and fabrics have sufficient peculiar characteristics and uses to constitute them products sufficiently distinct from all other finishes \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 594]\n\u00a0\n and fabrics\n12\n to make them a \"line of commerce\" within the meaning of the Clayton Act. Cf. Van Camp & Sons Co. v. American Can Co., \n278 \nU.S. 245\n.\n13\n Thus, the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 595]\n\u00a0\n bounds of the relevant market for the purposes of this case are not coextensive with the total market for finishes and fabrics, but are coextensive with the automobile industry, the relevant market for automotive finishes and fabrics.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nThe market affected must be substantial. Standard Fashion Co. v. Magrane-Houston Co., \n258 \nU.S. 346, 357\n. Moreover, in order to establish a violation of 7 the Government must prove a likelihood that competition may be \"foreclosed in a substantial share of . . . [that market].\"\n15\n Both requirements are satisfied in this case. The substantiality of a relevant market comprising the automobile industry is undisputed. The substantiality of General Motors' share of that market is fully established in the evidence.\n\nGeneral Motors is the colossus of the giant automobile industry. It accounts annually for upwards of two-fifths of the total sales of automotive vehicles in the Nation.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 596]\n\u00a0\n In 1955 General Motors ranked first in sales and second in assets among all United States industrial corporations\n17\n and became the first corporation to earn over a billion dollars in annual net income.\n18\n In 1947 General Motors' total purchases of all products from du Pont were $26,628,274, of which $18,938,229 (71%) represented purchases from du Pont's Finishes Division. Of the latter amount purchases of \"Duco\"\n19\n and the thinner used to apply \"Duco\" totaled $12,224,798 (65%), and \"Dulux\"\n20\n purchases totaled $3,179,225. Purchases by General Motors of du Pont fabrics in 1948 amounted to $3,700,000, making it the largest account of du Pont's Fabrics Division. Expressed in percentages, du Pont supplied 67% of General Motors' requirements for finishes in 1946 and 68% in 1947.\n21\n In fabrics du Pont supplied 52.3% of requirements in 1946, and 38.5% in 1947.\n22\n Because General Motors accounts for almost one-half of the automobile industry's annual sales, its requirements for automotive finishes and fabrics must represent approximately one-half of the relevant market for these materials. Because the record clearly shows that quantitatively and percentagewise du Pont supplies the largest part of General Motors' requirements, we must conclude that du Pont has a substantial share of the relevant market.\n\nThe appellees argue that the Government could not maintain this action in 1949 because 7 is applicable only to the acquisition of stock and not to the holding \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 597]\n\u00a0\n or subsequent use of the stock. This argument misconceives the objective toward which 7 is directed. The Clayton Act was intended to supplement the Sherman Act.\n23\n Its aim was primarily to arrest apprehended consequences of intercorporate relationships before those relationships could work their evil, which may be at or any time after the acquisition, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case. The Senate declared the objective of the Clayton Act to be as follows:\n\n \". . . Broadly stated, the bill, in its treatment of unlawful restraints and monopolies, seeks to prohibit and make unlawful certain trade practices which, as a rule, singly and in themselves, are not covered by the Act of July 2, 1890 [the Sherman Act], or other existing antitrust acts, and thus, by making these practices illegal, to arrest the creation of trusts, conspiracies, and monopolies in their incipiency and before consummation. . . .\" S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 1. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\"Incipiency\" in this context denotes not the time the stock was acquired, but any time when the acquisition threatens to ripen into a prohibited effect. See Transamerica Corp. v. Board of Governors, 206 F.2d 163, 166. To accomplish the congressional aim, the Government may proceed at any time that an acquisition may be said with reasonable probability to contain a threat that it may lead to a restraint of commerce or tend to create a monopoly of a line of commerce.\n24\n Even when the purchase is solely for investment, the plain language of 7 contemplates an action at any time the stock is used to \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 598]\n\u00a0\n bring about, or in attempting to bring about, the substantial lessening of competition.\n25\n\u00a0\n\n\n Prior cases under 7 were brought at or near the time of acquisition. See, e. g., International Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n280 \nU.S. 291\n; V. Vivaudou, Inc. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 54 F.2d 273; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Thatcher Mfg. Co., 5 F.2d 615, rev'd in part on another ground, \n272 \nU.S. 554\n; United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 11 F. Supp. 117; In re Vanadium-Alloys Steel Co., 18 F. T. C. 194. None of these cases holds, or even suggests, that the Government is foreclosed from bringing the action at any time when a threat of the prohibited effects is evident.\n\nRelated to this argument is the District Court's conclusion that 30 years of nonrestraint negated \"any reasonable probability of such a restraint\" at the time of the suit.\n26\n While it is, of course, true that proof of a mere possibility of a prohibited restraint or tendency to monopoly will not establish the statutory requirement that the effect of an acquisition \"may be\" such restraint or tendency,\n27\n the basic facts found by the District Court demonstrate the error of its conclusion.\n28\n\u00a0\n\nThe du Pont Company's commanding position as a General Motors supplier was not achieved until shortly \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 599]\n\u00a0\n after its purchase of a sizable block of General Motors stock in 1917.\n29\n At that time its production for the automobile industry and its sales to General Motors were relatively insignificant. General Motors then produced only about 11% of the total automobile production and its requirements, while relatively substantial, were far short of the proportions they assumed as it forged ahead to its present place in the industry.\n\nAt least 10 years before the stock acquisition, the du Pont Company, for over a century the manufacturer of military and commercial explosives, had decided to expand its business into other fields. It foresaw the loss of its market for explosives after the United States Army and Navy decided in 1908 to construct and operate their own plants. Nitrocellulose, a nitrated cotton, was the principal raw material used in du Pont's manufacture of smokeless powder. A search for outlets for this raw material uncovered requirements in the manufacture of lacquers, celluloid, artificial leather and artificial silk. The first step taken was the du Pont purchase in 1910 of the Fabrikoid Company, then the largest manufacturer of artificial leather, reconstituted as the du Pont Fabrikoid Company in 1913.\n\nThe expansion program was barely started, however, when World War I intervened. The du Pont Company suddenly found itself engulfed with orders for military explosives from foreign nations later to be allies of the United States in the war, and it had to increase its capacity and plant facilities from 700,000 to 37,000,000 pounds per month at a cost exceeding $200,000,000. Profits accumulated and ultimately amounted to $232,000,000. The need to find postwar uses for its expanded facilities and organization now being greater than ever, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 600]\n\u00a0\n du Pont continued its expansion program during the war years, setting aside $90,000,000 for the purpose. In September 1915, du Pont bought the Arlington Works, one of the Nation's two largest celluloid companies. In June 1916, the Fairfield Rubber Company, producers of rubber-coated fabrics for automobile and carriage tops, was taken over by du Pont Fabrikoid. In March 1917, purchase was made of Harrison Brothers and Company, manufacturers of paint, varnish, acids and certain inorganic chemicals used in paint manufacture. Shortly afterwards, Harrison absorbed Beckton Chemical Company, a color manufacturer, and, also in 1917, the Bridgeport Wood Finishing Company, a varnish manufacturer.\n\nThus, before the first block of General Motors stock was acquired, du Pont was seeking markets not only for its nitrocellulose, but also for the artificial leather, celluloid, rubber-coated goods, and paints and varnishes in demand by automobile companies. In that connection, the trial court expressly found that \". . . reports and other documents written at or near the time of the investment show that du Pont's representatives were well aware that General Motors was a large consumer of products of the kind offered by du Pont,\" and that John J. Raskob, du Pont's treasurer and the principal promoter of the investment, \"for one, thought that du Pont would ultimately get all that business . . . .\"\n30\n\u00a0\n\nThe Company's interest in buying into General Motors was stimulated by Raskob and Pierre S. du Pont, then du Pont's president, who acquired personal holdings of General Motors stock in 1914. General Motors was organized six years earlier by William C. Durant to acquire previously independent automobile manufacturing companies - Buick, Cadillac, Oakland and Oldsmobile. Durant later brought in Chevrolet, organized by \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 601]\n\u00a0\n him when he was temporarily out of power, during 1910-1915, and a bankers' group controlled General Motors. In 1915, when Durant and the bankers deadlocked on the choice of a Board of Directors, they resolved the deadlock by an agreement under which Pierre S. du Pont was named Chairman of the General Motors Board, and Pierre S. du Pont, Raskob and two nominees of Mr. du Pont were named neutral directors. By 1916, Durant settled his differences with the bankers and resumed the presidency and his controlling position in General Motors. He prevailed upon Pierre S. du Pont and Raskob to continue their interest in General Motors' affairs, which both did as members of the Finance Committee, working closely with Durant in matters of finances and operations and plans for future expansion. Durant persistently urged both men and the \"Wilmington people, as he called it,\"\n31\n to buy more stock in General Motors.\n\nFinally, Raskob broached to Pierre S. du Pont the proposal that part of the fund earmarked for du Pont expansion be used in the purchase of General Motors stock. At this time about $50,000,000 of the $90,000,000 fund was still in hand. Raskob foresaw the success of the automobile industry and the opportunity for great profit in a substantial purchase of General Motors stock. On December 19, 1917, Raskob submitted a Treasurer's Report to the du Pont Finance Committee recommending a purchase of General Motors stock in the amount of $25,000,000. That report makes clear that more than just a profitable investment was contemplated. A major consideration was that an expanding General Motors would provide a substantial market needed by the burgeoning du Pont organization. Raskob's summary of reasons in support of the purchase includes this statement: \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 602]\n\u00a0\n \"Our interest in the General Motors Company will undoubtedly secure for us the entire Fabrikoid, Pyralin [celluloid], paint and varnish business of those companies, which is a substantial factor.\" (Emphasis added.)\n32\n\u00a0\n\nThis thought, that the purchase would result in du Pont's obtaining a new and substantial market, was echoed in the Company's 1917 and 1918 annual reports to stockholders. In the 1917 report appears: \"Though this is a new line of activity, it is one of great promise and one that seems to be well suited to the character of our organization. The motor companies are very large consumers of our Fabrikoid and Pyralin as well as paints and varnishes.\" (Emphasis added.) The 1918 report says: \"The consumption of paints, varnishes and fabrikoid in the manufacture of automobiles gives another common interest.\"\n\nThis background of the acquisition, particularly the plain implications of the contemporaneous documents, destroys any basis for a conclusion that the purchase was made \"solely for investment.\" Moreover, immediately after the acquisition, du Pont's influence growing out of it was brought to bear within General Motors to achieve primacy for du Pont as General Motors' supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes.\n\nTwo years were to pass before du Pont's total purchases of General Motors stock brought its percentage to 23% of the outstanding stock and its aggregate outlay to $49,000,000. During that period, du Pont and Durant worked under an arrangement giving du Pont primary responsibility for finances and Durant the responsibility for operations. But J. A. Haskell, du Pont's former sales manager and vice-president, became the General Motors vice-president in charge of the operations committee. The trial judge said that Haskell \". . . was willing to undertake \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 603]\n\u00a0\n the responsibility of keeping du Pont informed of General Motors affairs during Durant's regime . . . .\"\n33\n\u00a0\n\nHaskell frankly and openly set about gaining the maximum share of the General Motors market for du Pont. In a contemporaneous 1918 document, he reveals his intention to \"pave the way for perhaps a more general adoption of our material,\" and that he was thinking \"how best to get cooperation [from the several General Motors Divisions] whereby makers of such of the low priced cars as it would seem possible and wise to get transferred will be put in the frame of mind necessary for its adoption [du Pont's artificial leather].\"\n\nHaskell set up lines of communication within General Motors to be in a position to know at all times what du Pont products and what products of du Pont competitors were being used. It is not pure imagination to suppose that such surveillance from that source made an impressive impact upon purchasing officials. It would be understandably difficult for them not to interpret it as meaning that a preference was to be given to du Pont products. Haskell also actively pushed the program to substitute Fabrikoid artificial leathers for genuine leather and sponsored use of du Pont's Pyralin sheeting through a liaison arrangement set up between himself and the du Pont sales organization.\n\nThus sprung from the barrier, du Pont quickly swept into a commanding lead over its competitors, who were never afterwards in serious contention. Indeed, General Motors' then principal paint supplier, Flint Varnish and Chemical Works, early in 1918 saw the handwriting on the wall. The Flint president came to Durant asking to be bought out, telling Durant, as the trial judge found, that he \"knew du Pont had bought a substantial interest in General Motors and was interested in the paint industry; that . . . [he] felt he would lose a valuable \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 604]\n\u00a0\n customer, General Motors.\"\n34\n The du Pont Company bought the Flint Works and later dissolved it.\n\nIn less than four years, by August 1921, Lammot du Pont, then a du Pont vice-president and later Chairman of the Board of General Motors, in response to a query from Pierre S. du Pont, then Chairman of the Board of both du Pont and General Motors, \"whether General Motors was taking its entire requirements of du Pont products from du Pont,\" was able to reply that four of General Motors' eight operating divisions bought from du Pont their entire requirements of paints and varnishes, five their entire requirements of Fabrikoid, four their entire requirements of rubber cloth, and seven their entire requirements of Pyralin and celluloid. Lammot du Pont quoted du Pont's sales department as feeling that \"the condition is improving and that eventually satisfactory conditions will be established in every branch, but they wouldn't mind seeing things going a little faster.\" Pierre S. du Pont responded that \"with the change in management at Cadillac, Oakland and Olds [Cadillac was taking very little paints and varnishes, and Oakland but 50%; Olds was taking only part of its requirements for fabrikoid], I believe that you should be able to sell substantially all of the paint, varnish and fabrikoid products needed.\" He also suggested that \"a drive should be made for the Fisher Body business. Is there any reason why they have not dealt with us?\"\n\nFisher Body was stubbornly resistant to du Pont sales pressure. General Motors, in 1920, during Durant's time, acquired 60% stock control of Fisher Body Company. However, a voting trust was established giving the Fisher brothers broad powers of management. They insisted on running their own show and for years withstood efforts of high-ranking du Pont and General Motors executives to \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 605]\n\u00a0\n get them to switch to du Pont from their accustomed sources of supply. Even after General Motors obtained 100% stock control in 1926, the Fisher brothers retained sufficient power to hold out. By 1947 and 1948, however, Fisher resistance had collapsed, and the proportions of its requirements supplied by du Pont compared favorably with the purchases by other General Motors Divisions.\n\nIn 1926, the du Pont officials felt that too much General Motors business was going to its competitors. When Pierre S. du Pont and Raskob expressed surprise, Lammot du Pont gave them a breakdown, by dollar amounts, of the purchases made from du Pont's competitors. This breakdown showed, however, that only Fisher Body of the General Motors divisions was obtaining any substantial proportion of its requirements from du Pont's competitors.\n\nCompetitors did obtain higher percentages of the General Motors business in later years, although never high enough at any time substantially to affect the dollar amount of du Pont's sales. Indeed, it appears likely that General Motors probably turned to outside sources of supply at least in part because its requirements outstripped du Pont's production, when General Motors' proportion of total automobile sales grew greater and the company took its place as the sales leader of the automobile industry. For example, an undisputed Government exhibit shows that General Motors took 93% of du Pont's automobile Duco production in 1941 and 83% in 1947.\n\nThe fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du Pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du Pont by a stock interest. The inference is overwhelming that du Pont's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 606]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe agree with the trial court that considerations of price, quality and service were not overlooked by either du Pont or General Motors. Pride in its products and its high financial stake in General Motors' success would naturally lead du Pont to try to supply the best. But the wisdom of this business judgment cannot obscure the fact, plainly revealed by the record, that du Pont purposely employed its stock to pry open the General Motors market to entrench itself as the primary supplier of General Motors' requirements for automotive finishes and fabrics.\n35\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 607]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSimilarly, the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly, each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone, including du Pont's competitors, does not defeat the Government's right to relief. It is not requisite to the proof of a violation of 7 to show that restraint or monopoly was intended.\n\nThe statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute. We repeat, that the test of a violation of 7 is whether, at the time of suit, there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints. The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition. The fire that was kindled in 1917 continues to smolder. It burned briskly to forge the ties that bind the General Motors market to du Pont, and if it has quieted down, it remains hot, and, from past performance, is likely at any time to blaze and make the fusion complete.\n36\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination, after further hearing, of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute. The District Courts, in the framing of equitable decrees, are clothed \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 608]\n\u00a0\n \"with large discretion to model their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case.\" International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392, 400\n-401.\n\nThe motion of the appellees Christiana Securities Company and Delaware Realty and Investment Company for dismissal of the appeal as to them is denied. It seems appropriate that they be retained as parties pending determination by the District Court of the relief to be granted.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE CLARK, MR.

The varnish method then used in finishing automobiles was described in detail at the trial by automobile pioneers . . . . Finishing an automobile with varnish required an intolerably long time - up to 3 or 4 weeks - to apply the numerous coats needed. When the finish was complete, its longest life expectancy was less than a year, and often it began to peel off before the car was delivered. . . .\"\n\n\n Du Pont's Director of Sales since 1944, Nickowitz, testified as to fabrics sold to automobile manufacturers as follows:\n\n\"Q. Now, over the years, isn't it true that speaking generally du Pont has followed the policy in selling its fabrics to the automobile field of undercutting its competitors in price? You don't try to sell it on a lower price than that quoted by any other competitor, do you?\n\n\n\"A. Well, we don't know. We go in and we bid based on our costs. Now, in the automotive industry, we have a different situation than you do in the furniture trade, for example, where you have an established price.\n\n\n\"You see, in the automobile industry, each manufacturer uses a different construction. They all have their own peculiar ideas of what they want about these fabrics.

Pratt, when a General Motors vice president and member of the Executive Committee, to the general manager of a General Motors Division:\n\n\"I am glad to know that your manufacturing, chemical and purchasing divisions feel they would be in better hands possibly by dealing with duPont than with local companies. From a business standpoint no doubt your organization would be influenced to give the business, under equal conditions, to the local concerns. However, I think when General Motors divisions recognize the sacrifice that the duPont Company made in 1920 and 1921, to keep General Motors Corporation from being put in a very bad light publicly - the duPont Company going to the extent of borrowing $35,000,000 on its notes when the company was entirely free of debt, in order to prevent a large amount of General Motors stock being thrown on the open market - they should give weight to this which in my mind more than over-balances consideration of local conditions. In other words, I feel that where conditions are equal from the standpoint of quality, service and price, the duPont Company should have the major share of General Motors divisions' business on those items that the duPont Company can take on the basis of quality, service and price. If it is possible to use the product from more than one company I do not think it advisable to give any one company all of the business, as I think it is desirable to always keep a competitive situation, otherwise any supplier is liable to grow slack in seeing that you have the best service and price possible.\n\n\n\"I have expressed my own personal sentiments in this letter to you in order that you might have my point of view, but I do not wish to influence your organization in any way that would be against \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 607]\n\u00a0\n your own good judgment, keeping in mind that above all the prime consideration is to do the best thing for Delco-Light Company, and that considerations in regard to the duPont Company or other concerns are secondary, and I am sure this is your feeling.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] The potency of the influence of du Pont's 23% stock interest is greater today because of the diffusion of the remaining shares which, in 1947, were held by 436,510 stockholders; 92% owned no more than 100 shares each, and 60% owned no more than 25 shares each. 126 F. Supp., at 244.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins, dissenting.\n\nIn June 1949, the United States brought this civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under 4 of the Sherman Act and 15 of the Clayton Act to enjoin alleged violations of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and 7 of the Clayton Act. The amended complaint, insofar as pertinent to the issues here, alleged that du Pont and General Motors have been engaged, since 1915, in a combination and conspiracy to restrain and monopolize interstate trade, and that du Pont's acquisition of General Motors' stock had the effect of restraining trade and tending to create a monopoly. In brief it was alleged that, by means of the relationship between du Pont and General Motors, du Pont intended to obtain, and did obtain, an illegal preference over its competitors in the sale to General Motors of its products, and a further illegal preference in the development of chemical discoveries made by General Motors. Appellees denied the charges. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 609]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe trial of these issues took nearly seven months. The District Court heard 52 witnesses, including most of the principal actors, and received over 2,000 exhibits. The evidence contained in the 8,283-page transcript of record covers in minute and intimate detail the facts bearing on the Government's charge that du Pont, by coercion, agreement, control or influence, had interfered unlawfully with General Motors' purchasing and manufacturing policies. On the basis of this evidence, the District Court found that the Government had failed to prove its case and, specifically, that (a) du Pont did not control General Motors. (b) there had been \"no limitation or restraint upon General Motors' freedom to deal freely and fully with competitors of du Pont\" or upon its \"freedom . . . to deal with its chemical discoveries,\" and (c) after 30 years in which no such restraint had resulted, there was no \"basis for a finding that there is or has been any reasonable probability of such a restraint within the meaning of the Clayton Act.\" 126 F. Supp. 235, 335.\n\nThe Government's basic contention in this Court is that du Pont violated 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act in that, by means of its alleged control of General Motors, it obtained an unlawful preference with respect to General Motors' purchases of materials. In the closing pages of its brief, and for a few minutes in its oral argument, the Government added the assertion that du Pont had violated 7 of the Clayton Act in that its stock interest in General Motors \"has been used to channel General Motors' purchases to du Pont.\"\n\nThis Court, ignoring the Sherman Act issues which have been the focal point of eight years of litigation, now holds that du Pont's acquisition of a 23% stock interest in General Motors during the years 1917-1919 violates 7 of the Clayton Act because \"at the time of suit [in 1949] there [was] a reasonable probability that the acquisition [was] likely to result in the condemned \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 610]\n\u00a0\n restraints.\" Ante, p. 607. In reaching this conclusion, the Court holds (1) that 7 of the Clayton Act applies to vertical as well as horizontal stock acquisitions; (2) that in determining whether the effect of the stock acquisition is such as to constitute a restraint within 7, the time chosen by the Government in bringing the action is controlling rather than the time of the acquisition itself; and (3) that 7 is violated when, at the time of suit, there is a reasonable probability that the stock acquisition is likely to result in the foreclosure of competitors of the acquiring corporation from a substantial share of the relevant market.\n\nIn applying these principles to this case, the Court purports to accept the carefully documented findings of fact of the District Court. Actually, it overturns numerous well-supported findings of the District Court by now concluding that du Pont did not purchase General Motors' stock solely for investment; that du Pont's stock interest resulted in practical or working control of General Motors; that du Pont has used or might use this \"control\" to secure preferences in supplying General Motors with automobile finishes and fabrics; that the relevant market includes only automobile finishes and fabrics; and that there was, even at the time of suit in 1949, a reasonable probability that du Pont's competitors might be foreclosed from a substantial share of this relevant market.\n\nThe Court's decision is far reaching. Although 7 of the Clayton Act was enacted in 1914 - over 40 years ago - this is the first case in which the United States or the Federal Trade Commission has sought to apply it to a vertical integration.\n1\n Likewise, this appears to be the first case in which it ever has been argued that 7 is applicable to a stock acquisition which took place many \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 611]\n\u00a0\n years before.\n2\n The Court, in accepting both of these contentions, disregards the language and purpose of the statute, 40 years of administrative practice, and all the precedents except one District Court decision. The sweeping character of the Court's pronouncement is further evident from the fact that to make its case the Court requires no showing of any misuse of a stock interest - either at the time of acquisition or subsequently - to gain preferential treatment from the acquired corporation. All that is required, if this case is to be our guide, is that some court in some future year be persuaded that a \"reasonable probability\" then exists that an advantage over competitors in a narrowly construed market may be obtained as a result of the stock interest. Thus, over 40 years after the enactment of the Clayton Act, it now becomes apparent for the first time that 7 has been a sleeping giant all along. Every corporation which has acquired a stock interest in another corporation after the enactment of the Clayton Act in 1914, and which has had business dealings with that corporation is exposed, retroactively, to the bite of the newly discovered teeth of 7.\n\nFor the reasons given below, I believe that the Court has erred in (1) applying 7 to a vertical acquisition; (2) holding that the time chosen by the Government in bringing the action is controlling rather than the time of the stock acquisition itself; and (3) concluding, in disregard of the findings of fact of the trial court, that the facts of this case fall within its theory of illegality.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nSection 7 of the Clayton Act, quoted in full in the Appendix, post, pp. 655-656, does not make unlawful all \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 612]\n\u00a0\n intercorporate acquisitions and mergers.\n3\n It does not apply to acquisitions of physical assets.\n4\n It applies only to certain acquisitions of stock, and even then with important exceptions. The first paragraph of 7, which is the statutory provision primarily involved in this case, provides -\n\n \"That no corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce.\" 38 Stat. 731-732, 15 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 18.\n\n\n This paragraph makes unlawful only those intercorporate stock acquisitions which may result in any of three effects: (1) substantially lessen competition between the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 613]\n\u00a0\n acquiring and the acquired corporations; (2) restrain commerce in any section or community; or (3) tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce. The Government concedes that General Motors and du Pont have never been in competition with each other. Since the substantially lessen competition clause applies only to acquisitions involving competing corporations (generally referred to as horizontal acquisitions), that clause concededly is not applicable to this case. The questions before us are whether the other unlawful effects, namely, restraint of commerce in any section or community and tendency to create a monopoly of any line of commerce, are applicable to this case, and, if so, whether the 1917-1919 acquisition of General Motors' stock by du Pont resulted or may result in either of those unlawful effects.\n\nSection 7 never has been authoritatively interpreted as prohibiting the acquisition of stock in a corporation that is not engaged in the same line of business as the acquiring corporation. Although the language of the Act is ambiguous, the relevant legislative history, administrative practice, and judicial interpretation support the conclusion that 7 does not apply to vertical acquisitions.\n\nThe report of the House Committee on the Judiciary, presented by Representative Clayton, stated emphatically that the provisions relating to stock acquisitions by corporations, which originally appeared as 8 of the bill, were intended to eliminate the evils of holding companies. H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 17. Although a \"holding company\" was defined as \"a company that holds the stock of another company or companies,\" the one \"evil\" referred to was that a holding company \"is a means of holding under one control the competing companies whose stocks it has thus acquired.\" (Emphasis supplied.) Ibid. Two minority statements appended to the House Report evidence a similar understanding that the provisions of the bill were limited to competing corporations. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 614]\n\u00a0\n Id., Pt. 2, p. 6; Pt. 3, p. 8. The substance of the House Report was adopted by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in its report on the bill. S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 13, 43, 46.\n\nThe extensive debates on the bill in each House of Congress contain many detailed discussions of the provisions relating to intercorporate stock acquisitions. These discussions are devoid of any suggestion that the provisions were to apply to vertical acquisitions.\n5\n On the contrary, these provisions of the bill were repeatedly described as prohibiting the acquisition of stock of competing companies.\n6\n The one specific reference to a vertical acquisition during the entire debate on these provisions ended with a flat statement by Senator Reed to the effect that the bill as then written (containing the tendency toward monopoly clause but not the restraint of commerce clause) would not prevent a steel manufacturing corporation from acquiring stock in an ore producing corporation, a classic type of vertical integration.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 615]\n\u00a0\n A reading of the legislative history of the bill leaves the distinct impression that intercorporate relationships between buyers and sellers which resulted in noncompetitive preferences were intended to be dealt with exclusively by the provision forbidding interlocking directorates ( 8 of the Clayton Act), if not covered by the specific prohibitions of certain price discriminations ( 2), and of certain exclusive selling or leasing contracts ( 3).\n8\n\u00a0\n\nForty years of administrative practice provides additional support for this view. Neither the Department of Justice nor the Federal Trade Commission, the two principal enforcing agencies, has brought any action under old 7 (other than the instant case) that has not involved a stock acquisition in allegedly competing corporations. The Federal Trade Commission repeatedly has declared its understanding that 7, prior to its amendment in 1950, applied only to competing corporations.\n9\n In a recent report it stated without qualification:\n\n\"While the 1914 act applied solely to horizontal mergers, the 1950 act applies not only to horizontal \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 616]\n\u00a0\n acquisitions but to vertical and conglomerate acquisitions which might substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.\" F. T. C., Report on Corporate Mergers and Acquisitions (May 1955), 168, H. R. Doc. No. 169, 84th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n Beginning in 1927, the Federal Trade Commission included in its annual recommendations to Congress a request that 7 be amended to remedy its inadequacies. This result was achieved in 1950. 64 Stat. 1125, 15 U.S.C. 18. As the Court recognizes in its opinion, ante, p. 590, one of the reasons for amending 7 in 1950 was, in the words of the House Report on the amendments, \"to make it clear that the bill applies to all types of mergers and acquisitions, vertical and conglomerate as well as horizontal . . . .\" H. R. Rep. No. 1191. 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 11. Forty years of established administrative practice, acquiesced in and recognized by Congress, is persuasive evidence of the proper scope of 7. Federal Trade Commission v. Bunte Bros., Inc., \n312 \nU.S. 349, 351\n-352.\n\nThe cases cited by the Court, with the one exception of Ronald Fabrics Co. v. Verney Brunswick Mills, Inc., CCH Trade Cases \u00a7 57.514 (D.C. S. D. N. Y. 1946),\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 617]\n\u00a0\n do not support the Court's conclusion that 7 applies to a vertical acquisition. In Aluminum Co. of America v. Federal Trade Commission, 284 F. 401 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1922), the Aluminum Company, which previously had a monopoly of all sheet aluminum produced in the United States, acquired control through an intermediary corporation of a competing sheet aluminum company established in 1916. A divestiture order of the Federal Trade Commission was upheld, the court holding that the stock acquisition substantially lessened competition and tended to create a monopoly of the sheet aluminum business. In United States v. New England Fish Exchange, 258 F. 732 (D.C. Mass. 1919), two holding companies which had acquired the stock of virtually all the wholesale fish dealers trading on the New England Fish Exchange, which handled about 95% of all the ground fish sold in interstate commerce in the United States, were held to have violated the provisions of 7. Each of these cases was concerned with the acquisition of directly competing corporations - not vertical acquisitions. Statements in the opinions, not essential to the decisions, merely stand for the proposition that the restraint and monopoly clauses of 7 are not entirely synonymous with the substantially lessen competition clause.\n\nAssuming that the three unlawful effects mentioned in 7 are not entirely synonymous with each other,\n11\n such an \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 618]\n\u00a0\n assumption does not require the conclusion that 7 was intended to apply to vertical acquisitions as well as to horizontal acquisitions. Corporations engaged in the same business activity in different areas do not necessarily \"compete\" with each other so that their combination would substantially lessen competition between them, even though their combination might result in a restraint of commerce or a tendency toward monopoly violative of 7. Such a possibility was presented in Transamerica Corp. v. Board of Governors, 206 F.2d 163 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1953), where a banking corporation through a series of transactions acquired stock in 48 local banking corporations, most of which were located in communities in which no other bank was acquired. A divestiture order of the Board was reversed on the ground that the Board had not proved that the acquisitions of these banks in five western States either substantially lessened competition or tended to create a monopoly.\n\nFinally, this Court has twice construed old 7 as applying only to stock acquisitions involving competing corporations. In International Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, \n280 \nU.S. 291\n (1930), the Court held that the acquisition of the fifth largest shoe manufacturing company by the largest shoe manufacturer did not violate either the substantially lessen competition clause or the restraint of commerce clause of 7 because the pre-existing competition between the two corporations was insubstantial, and because the acquired corporation was \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 619]\n\u00a0\n in a precarious financial condition. Substantial pre-existing competition was said to be a requisite for violation of either clause of 7. \n280 \nU.S., at 298\n, 303. An even more direct holding is found in Thatcher Mfg. Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, \n272 \nU.S. 554\n (1926), where this Court affirmed that portion of the lower court's decree which had allowed Thatcher, a milk bottle manufacturer, to retain the assets of Woodbury, a bottle manufacturer specializing in condiment and whiskey bottles. on the ground that the acquisition did not violate any of the three clauses of 7 since Thatcher was not in competition with Woodbury. \n272 \nU.S., at 560\n, affirming in part and reversing in part Federal Trade Commission v. Thatcher Mfg. Co., 5 F.2d 615 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1925). These holdings apparently will be overruled sub silentio by today's decision.\n\nThe legislative history, administrative practice, and judicial interpretation of 7 provide the perspective in which the Government's present assertion that 7 applies to vertical acquisitions should be viewed. Seen as a whole, they offer convincing evidence that 7, properly construed, has reference only to horizontal acquisitions. I would so hold. However, even if the opposite view be accepted, the foregoing views of the enforcing agencies and the courts are material to a proper consideration of the other issues which must then be reached.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nIn this case the Government is challenging, in 1949, a stock acquisition that took place in 1917-1919. The Court, without advancing reasons to support its conclusion, holds that in determining whether the effect of the stock acquisition is such as to violate 7, the time chosen by the Government in bringing its suit is controlling rather than the time of the acquisition of the stock. This seems to me to ignore the language and structure of 7, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 620]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of the Clayton Act, and all existing administrative and judicial precedents.\n\nThe first paragraph of 7 provides that \"no corporation . . . shall acquire . . . the stock . . . of another corporation . . . where the effect of such acquisition may be . . . .\" Yet the Court construes this provision as if it read \"no corporation . . . shall acquire or continue to hold . . . the stock . . . of another corporation . . . whenever it shall appear that the effect of such acquisition or continued holding may be . . . .\" Continued holding, to be sure, is a prerequisite to any action under 7 because, if the stock is no longer held, the violation has been purged and there is nothing to divest.\n12\n But the fact of continued holding does not allow the Government to dispense with the necessity of proving that the stock was unlawfully acquired. The offense described by 7 is the acquisition, not the holding or the use, of stock. When the acquisition has been made, the offense, if any, is complete. The statutory language is unequivocal. It makes the test the probable effect of the acquisition at the time of the actual acquisition, and not at some later date to be arbitrarily chosen by the Government in bringing suit.\n\nThe distinction carefully made in the several paragraphs of 7 between an unlawful acquisition and an unlawful use of stock reinforces this conclusion. The first paragraph of 7, which speaks only in terms of acquisition of stock, is concerned solely with the purchase of stock in \"another corporation.\" It is the only provision that is applicable in this case. The second paragraph, which expressly prohibits both acquisition and use, is concerned with stock purchases in \"two or more corporations.\" Concededly, it is not applicable here. When Congress chose to make unlawful the use of stock \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 621]\n\u00a0\n subsequent to its acquisition, it did so in specific terms. The omission of the phrase \"or the use of such stock by the voting or granting of proxies or otherwise,\" contained in the second paragraph of 7, from the first paragraph of the section was not inadvertent. The phrase therefore cannot be read into the first paragraph of 7.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThe Clayton Act was not intended to replace the Sherman Act in remedying actual restraints and monopolies. Its purpose was to supplement the Sherman Act by checking anticompetitive tendencies in their incipiency, before they reached the point at which the Sherman Act comes into play. This purpose was well stated in the Senate Report on the bill:\n\n\"Broadly stated, the bill, in its treatment of unlawful restraints and monopolies, seeks to prohibit and make unlawful certain trade practices which, as a rule, singly and in themselves, are not covered by the act of July 2, 1890, or other existing antitrust acts, and thus, by making these practices illegal, to arrest the creation of trusts, conspiracies, and monopolies in their incipiency and before consummation.\" S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 1. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 622]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n This purpose places emphasis on the probable anticompetitive effects of transactions or occurrences viewed as of the date of their occurrence. The determination required by the Act is one of predicting the probable outcome of a particular transaction, here an acquisition of stock in another corporation. If, at the time of the stock acquisition, a potential threat to competition is apparent, the acquisition is unlawful under 7. If, on the other hand, a potential threat to competition is not then apparent, an antitrust violation is not involved unless subsequent use of the stock constitutes a restraint of trade prohibited by the Sherman Act.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court ignores the all-important lawfulness or unlawfulness of the stock acquisition at or about the time it occurred, and limits its attention to the probable anticompetitive effects of the continued holding of the stock at the time of suit, some 30 years later. The result is to subject a good-faith stock acquisition, lawful when made, to the hazard that the continued holding of the stock may make the acquisition illegal through unforeseen developments. Such a view is not supported by the statutory language and violates elementary principles of fairness. Suits brought under the Clayton Act are not subject to any statute of limitations, and it is doubtful whether the doctrine of laches applies as against the Government. The result is that unexpected and unforeseeable developments occurring long after a stock acquisition can be used to challenge the legality of continued holding of the stock. In such an action, the Government need only prove that probable rather than actual anticompetitive \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 623]\n\u00a0\n effects exist as of the time of suit. The Government may thus set aside a transaction which was entirely lawful when made, merely by showing that it would have been unlawful had it occurred at the time of suit, many years later. The growth of the acquired corporation, a fortuitous decline in the number of its competitors, or the achievement of control by an accidental diffusion of other stock may result, under this test, in rendering the originally lawful acquisition unlawful ab initio. Strikingly enough, all of these factors are involved in this case.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court's holding is unfair to the individuals who entered into transactions on the assumption, justified by the language of 7, that their actions would be judged by the facts available to them at the time they made their decision.\n\n\"The prohibition [of 7] is addressed to parties who contemplate engaging in merger transactions and is meant, in the first instance, to guide them in deciding upon a course of action. The only standard they are capable of applying is one addressed to the circumstances viewed as of the date of the proposed transaction. Since this is the standard which the parties must apply in deciding whether to undertake a transaction, it seems reasonable to conclude that it is the standard which enforcement agencies should \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 624]\n\u00a0\n  apply in deciding whether the transaction violates  the statute.\" Neal, The Clayton Act and the Transamerica  Case, 5 Stan. L. Rev. 179, 220-221.\n\n\n The Court cites no authority in support of its new interpretation of this 40-year-old statute. On the other hand, examination of the dozen or more cases brought under 7 reveals that in every case the inquiry heretofore has centered on the probable anticompetitive effects of the stock acquisition at or near the time it was made.\n16\n See, e. g., International Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, \n280 \nU.S. 291\n (1930); Transamerica Corp. v. Board of Governors, 206 F.2d 163 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1953); V. Vivaudou, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 54 F.2d 273 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1931); Federal Trade Commission v. Thatcher Mfg. Co., 5 F.2d 615 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1925), rev'd in part on another ground, \n272 \nU.S. 554\n; United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 11 F. Supp. 117 (D.C. N. D. Ohio 1935); In re Vanadium-Alloys Steel Co., 18 F. T. C. 194 (1934). The conclusion thus seems inescapable that the unlawfulness of a stock acquisition under the first paragraph of 7 properly turns on the potential threat to competition created by the acquisition of the stock at the time of its acquisition and not by its subsequent use.\n\nThat the time of acquisition is controlling does not mean that the Government is unable to bring an action if it fails to proceed within a few years of the stock acquisition. It means only that if the Government chooses to bring its action many years later, it must prove what 7 plainly requires - that the acquisition threatened competition when made. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 625]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor does it mean that evidence of subsequent events is necessarily irrelevant. Evidence that anticompetitive effects have occurred since the acquisition, and that these effects are traceable to the original acquisition rather than to other factors, may support an inference that such effects were \"reasonably probable\" at the time of acquisition. The element of causation is the necessary link with the past. However, if events subsequent to the acquisition indicate that no anticompetitive effects have occurred, that evidence may support an inference that an unlawful potential did not exist at the time of acquisition. Evidence as to what happened after the acquisition is relevant to the extent that it bears on the central question whether, at the time of the acquisition, there was a reasonable probability of a threat to competition.\n\nI agree with the Court that 7 does not require findings and conclusions of actual anticompetitive effects. Unlike the Sherman Act, 7 merely requires proof of a reasonable probability of a substantial lessening of competition, restraint of commerce, or tendency toward monopoly. International Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, \n280 \nU.S. 291\n; Transamerica Corp. v. Board of Governors, 206 F.2d 163. When a vertical acquisition is involved, its legality thus turns on whether there is a reasonable probability that it will foreclose competition from a substantial share of the market, either by significantly restricting access to needed supplies or by significantly limiting the market for any product. See Report of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws (1955) 122-127. The determination of such probable economic consequences requires study of the markets affected, of the companies involved in relation to those markets, and of the probable immediate and future effects on competition. A mere showing that a substantial dollar volume of sales is involved cannot suffice. As the Court says, \"The market \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 626]\n\u00a0\n affected must be substantial,\" ante, p. 595, and \"Substantiality can be determined only in terms of the market affected,\" ante, p. 593. Section 7 thus requires a case-by-case analysis of the relevant economic factors.\n\nHowever, when, as here, the Government brings a proceeding nearly 30 years after a stock purchase, it must prove that the acquisition was unlawful when made (i. e., that there was a reasonable probability at that time that du Pont's competitors would be foreclosed from a substantial share of the relevant market), and also that the effect of the acquisition continued to be harmful to competition at the time suit was brought. Illegality at the time of acquisition is required by the first paragraph of 7; continuing illegality is a prerequisite for obtaining equitable relief. See United States v. W. T. Grant Co., \n345 \nU.S. 629\n; United States v. Oregon Medical Society, \n343 \nU.S. 326, 333\n; United States v. South Buffalo R. Co., \n333 \nU.S. 771, 774\n. This is particularly true under 7 since it is a prophylactic measure designed to prevent stock acquisitions which probably will have a deleterious effect on competition. Proof that competition has not in fact been harmed during a long period following a stock acquisition itself indicates that a restraint in the future is unlikely. In such a case, the actual effect of the acquisition largely supplants the conjecture as to its probable effects which otherwise must be relied upon.\n\nIn this case, the District Court found that the challenged acquisition, which took place \"over thirty years ago,\" had not resulted in any restraint of trade \"In those many intervening years . . . .\" The District Court properly concluded that, when there had been no restraint for 30 years, \"there is not . . . any basis for a finding that there is . . . any reasonable probability of such a restraint within the meaning of the Clayton Act.\" 126 F. Supp., at 335. If the evidence supports the District Court's conclusion that there has been no restraint for 30 years, the judgment below must be affirmed. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 627]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe remaining issues are factual: (1) whether the record establishes the existence of a reasonable probability that du Pont's competitors will be foreclosed from securing General Motors' trade, and (2) whether the record establishes that such foreclosure, if probable, involves a substantial share of the relevant market and significantly limits the competitive opportunities of others trading in that market. In discussing these factual issues, I meet the Court on its own ground, that is, I assume that the old 7 applies to vertical acquisitions, and that the potential threat at the time of suit is controlling. Even on that basis the record does not support the Court's conclusion that 7 was violated by this 1917-1919 stock acquisition.\n\n  A. FORECLOSURE OF COMPETITORS.\n\n\n This is not a case where a supplier corporation has merged with its customer corporation with the result that the supplier's competitors are automatically and completely foreclosed from the customer's trade.\n17\n In this case, the only connection between du Pont, the supplier, and General Motors, the customer, is du Pont's 23% stock interest in General Motors. A conclusion that such a stock interest automatically forecloses du Pont's competitors from selling to General Motors would be without justification. Whether a foreclosure has occurred in the past or is probable in the future is a question of fact turning on the evidence in the record.\n\nThe Court, at the outset of its opinion, states that the primary issue is whether du Pont's position as a substantial \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 628]\n\u00a0\n supplier to General Motors \"was achieved on competitive merit alone,\" or resulted from du Pont's stock interest in General Motors. Ante, pp. 588-589. In resolving this issue, the Court states that the \"basic facts\" are not in dispute and hence that it is unnecessary to set aside the findings of fact of the District Court as clearly erroneous. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 52 (a). The basic facts are said to be that du Pont had no standing as a General Motors' supplier before the stock purchases of 1917-1919, that it gained a \"commanding position\" after the stock purchases, and that certain items of evidence in this gigantic record tend to indicate that du Pont hoped to get and actually did get a preference in General Motors' trade. From these alleged facts the Court draws the conclusion that du Pont has misused its 23% stock interest in General Motors \"to entrench itself as the primary supplier of General Motors' requirements for automotive finishes and fabrics.\" Ante, p. 606. \"The inference is overwhelming,\" the Court concludes, \"that du Pont's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit.\" Ante, p. 605. With these words, the Court overturns the District Court's unequivocal findings to the effect that du Pont was a principal supplier to General Motors prior to the 1917-1919 stock purchases, that du Pont maintained this position in the years following the stock purchases, and that for the entire 30-year period preceding the suit, General Motors' purchases of du Pont's products were based solely on the competitive merits of those products. The evidence supporting these findings of the District Court may be summarized as follows:\n\nDu Pont is primarily a manufacturer of chemicals and chemical products. Thousands of its products could be used by General Motors in manufacturing automobiles, appliances and machinery. Despite du Pont's sales efforts over a period of 40 years, General Motors buys \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 629]\n\u00a0\n many of the commodities produced by du Pont from du Pont's competitors.\n18\n The Court, ignoring the many products which General Motors declines to buy from du Pont or which it buys only in small quantities, concentrates on the few products which du Pont has sold in large volume to General Motors for many years - paints and fabrics. Before examining the history of those large-volume purchases, it is essential to understand where and by whom purchasing decisions within General Motors have been made.\n\nFor many years, General Motors has been organized into some 30 operating divisions, each of which has final authority to make, and does make, its own purchasing decisions. This decentralized management system places full responsibility for purchasing decisions on the officers of the respective divisions. To speak of \"selling to General Motors\" is, therefore, misleading. A prospective supplier, instead of selling to General Motors, sells to Chevrolet, or Frigidaire, or Ternstedt, or Delco Light, as divisions. Moreover, when there are several plants within a division, each plant frequently has its own purchasing agent and presents a separate selling job. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 630]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe record discloses that each division buys independently, that the pattern of buying varies greatly from one division to another, and that within each division purchases from du Pont have fluctuated greatly in response to price, quality, service and other competitive considerations. For example, Oldsmobile is the only division which buys antifreeze from du Pont and one of the two car divisions which does not finish its cars with Duco. Buick alone buys du Pont motor enamel, and Cadillac alone uses du Pont's copper electroplating exclusively. Thus the alleged nefarious influence arising from du Pont's stock interest apparently affects the Oldsmobile antifreeze buyer, but not the Oldsmobile paint buyer; the paint buyers at Chevrolet, Buick and Pontiac, but not the antifreeze or electroplating buyers; and the electroplating buyer at Cadillac, but not the Cadillac paint buyer.\n\n1. Paints. - Du Pont, for many years, has had marked success in the manufacture and sale of paints, varnishes, lacquers and related products.\n19\n In 1939, it produced 9.5% of the total dollar value of all finishes produced in \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 631]\n\u00a0\n the United States and, in 1947, 8.1%. In recent years, approximately three-fourths of du Pont's total sales to General Motors have consisted of industrial finishes.\n20\n Although du Pont has been General Motors' principal supplier of paint for many years, General Motors continues to buy about 30% of its paint requirements from competitors of du Pont.\n21\n Moreover, the sales of paint from du Pont to General Motors do not bulk large in the respective total sales and purchases of either company. In 1948, du Pont's finish sales to General Motors were only 3% of its total sales of all products; they were an infinitesimal percentage of General Motors' total purchases.\n\nTwo products account for a high proportion of these finish sales to General Motors: \"Duco,\" a nitrocellulose lacquer invented and patented by du Pont, and \"Dulux,\" a synthetic resin enamel developed by du Pont.\n22\n However, Duco and Dulux did not come into commercial use until 1924 and 1931, respectively, and du Pont's position as a \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 632]\n\u00a0\n principal manufacturer of finishes was attained much earlier.\n\nDu Pont first assumed a leading position in the automotive finish field with its acquisition, in 1918, of a majority of the stock of the Flint Varnish & Color Works at Flint, Michigan. At that time, and for some years before, Flint supplied the finishes used on all General Motors' cars except Cadillac, and also for many other automobile companies. Du Pont's acquisition of General Motors' stock in 1917-1919 did not influence the General Motors' divisions in purchasing from Flint. In 1921, Flint lost one-half of the Oakland business and, in 1923, a substantial portion of the business at Buick, Oakland and Oldsmobile. 126 F. Supp., at 288.\n\nThe invention and development of Duco in the early 1920's represented a significant technological advance. Automobiles previously had been finished by applying numerous coats of varnish. The finishing process took from 12 to 33 days, and the storage space and working capital tied up in otherwise completed cars were immense. The life expectancy of varnish finishes was less than a year. In December 1921, General Motors created a Paint and Enamel Committee which contacted numerous paint manufacturers in an attempt to find a quicker drying and more durable finish.\n\nMeanwhile, du Pont had been doing pioneering work in nitrocellulose lacquers. In 1920, a du Pont employee invented a quick drying and durable lacquer which contained a large amount of film-forming solids. This patented finish, named Duco, was submitted to the General Motors Paint and Enamel Committee in 1922 to be tested along with finishes of other manufacturers. After two years of testing and improvement, the Paint and Enamel Committee became satisfied that Duco was far superior \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 633]\n\u00a0\n to any other product or any other method of finishing automobiles then available.\n\nThe gradual adoption of Duco by some of the General Motors' car divisions, viewed in conjunction with its proved superiority as an auto finish, illustrates the independent buying of each division and demonstrates that Duco made its way on its own merits. Oakland (now Pontiac) first adopted Duco for use on its open cars in 1924. The new finish was an immense success and was used on all Oakland cars the following year. Buick and Chevrolet adopted Duco in 1925, but Cadillac, which had offered it as an optional finish in 1925, did not abandon varnish for Duco until 1926.\n23\n\u00a0\n\nFrom the beginning, General Motors continued to look for competitive materials. Letters were sent to other manufacturers urging them to submit samples of their pyroxylin paint for testing. Until 1927, none of the competing lacquers was comparable in quality to Duco. But the strenuous efforts by General Motors to develop competitive sources of lacquer eventually worked a substantial change in the du Pont position. Oldsmobile and Cadillac switched to a competitor, Rinshed-Mason, in 1927, and have continued to buy almost exclusively from that company ever since. Chevrolet, Buick and Pontiac continued to buy Duco, partly because of better service from nearby du Pont plants, and partly because repeated testing failed to disclose any lacquer superior to Duco.\n\nFinally, the success of Duco has never been confined to the General Motors' car divisions. In 1924 and 1925, nearly all car manufacturers abandoned varnish for Duco. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 634]\n\u00a0\n By the end of 1925, all cars, except Ford and Cadillac, were using Duco. Nash, Hudson, Studebaker, Packard and Willys have bought, and still buy, Duco in substantial amounts from du Pont. Chrysler bought Duco in large volume until the early 1930's when, in pursuance of a policy to obtain suppliers to whom it would be the most important customer, it concentrated its purchases on one company, Pittsburgh Plate Glass. Ford has chosen to make a large part of its own requirements. During the 1920's, when Ford was losing its leadership in the lowpriced field to Chevrolet, it continued to finish its cars in Black Japan. Mr. Ford is reported to have said, \"Paint them any color, as long as they are black.\" Finally, in the 1930's, Ford was forced to shift to a synthetic enamel finish of its own manufacture. During this transition period, du Pont sold Ford a substantial amount of finishes. In 1935, Ford was making half and buying half from du Pont; by 1937, Ford was making three-fourths and buying one-fourth from du Pont. In 1938, Henry Ford \"issued instructions that the Ford Motor Company was not to purchase any more material from the du Pont Company.\" From that time until Henry Ford II became active in Ford management, purchases from du Pont practically ceased. Since then, Ford has purchased finishes from du Pont in very substantial amounts.\n\nGeneral Motors has continued to test paints on thousands of cars annually. Du Pont has retained its position as primary lacquer supplier to several General Motors' divisions because these divisions have felt that Duco best fits their needs. Kettering, who was a leader in General Motors' research activities and who had been active in the testing and development of pyroxylin lacquers, testified that \"one of the reasons\" why General \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 635]\n\u00a0\n Motors' cars had a higher resale value than comparable cars \"in a used car lot\" \"is the paint.\"\n\nAs the District Court found, \"In view of all the evidence of record, the only reasonable conclusion is that du Pont has continued to sell Duco in substantial quantities to General Motors only because General Motors believes such purchases best fit its needs.\" (Emphasis supplied.) 126 F. Supp., at 296.\n\nThe second largest item which General Motors buys from du Pont is Dulux, a synthetic enamel finish used on refrigerators and other appliances. Prior to the development of Dulux, Duco was widely used as a finish for refrigerators. However, in 1927, Duco began to be replaced by porcelain, particularly at Frigidaire, a General Motors' appliance division. In 1930 and 1931, in collaboration with General Electric, du Pont developed Dulux, a greatly superior and cheaper product. Since its development, Dulux has been used exclusively by all the major manufacturers of refrigerators and other appliances - General Electric, Westinghouse, Crosley, and many others - except Frigidaire, which continues to finish part of its refrigerators with porcelain. Disinterested witnesses testified as to the superior quality and service which has led them to continue to buy Dulux.\n24\n The District Court did not err in concluding that Dulux -\n\n\"is apparently an ideal refrigerator finish and is widely used by a number of major manufacturers \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 636]\n\u00a0\n other than General Motors. Several representatives of competitive refrigerator manufacturers testified that they purchased 100% of their requirements from du Pont. There is no evidence that General Motors purchased from du Pont for any reason other than those that prompted its competitors to buy Dulux from du Pont - excellence of product, fair price and continuing quality of service.\" (Emphasis supplied.) 126 F. Supp., at 296.\n\n\n The Court fails to note that du Pont's efforts to sell paints other than Duco and Dulux to General Motors have met with considerably less success. Du Pont does sell substantial amounts of automotive undercoats to Chevrolet and Buick but it has failed, despite continued sales efforts, to change the preference of Fisher Body, the largest purchaser of undercoats, for a competitor's undercoat. The successes and failures of other du Pont finish products at various General Motors' divisions emphasize the independent buying of each division and negate the notion that influence or coercion is responsible for what purchases do occur. Frigidaire uses large quantities of black finishing and machine varnish, but has not bought these products from du Pont since 1926. At A C Spark Plug Division, located in Flint, Michigan, where du Pont has a finishes plant, du Pont has been consistently successful in selling a substantial volume of the finishes used by that division. Delco-Remy Division, however, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 637]\n\u00a0\n purchases most of its requirements of insulating varnish from du Pont's competitors. The Electromotive Division prefers a competitive lacquer for the interior finish of its locomotives, but uses Duco on the exterior because the railroads, most of which use Duco for the exterior of the balance of the train, specify that finish. At Guide Lamp Division, du Pont developed and still supplies a finish for the inside of headlight reflectors, but a competitor developed, and has kept, that division's substantial primer business. At the Inland Division, which produces steering wheels, du Pont had some of the business at one time, but has been completely supplanted by a competitor offering better service.\n\nThe du Pont experience at the Packard Electric Division, which uses large quantities of high and low tension cable lacquer, is illustrative. Until 1932, Packard Electric was a separate company wholly unrelated to General Motors, and du Pont was a principal supplier of low tension lacquer and the sole supplier of black high tension lacquer. Now, as a division of General Motors, Packard Electric purchases its entire requirements of high tension lacquer from du Pont competitors, and produces its own low tension lacquer from film scrap bought from du Pont competitors.\n\nThe District Court did not err in concluding, on the basis of this evidence, that du Pont's success in selling General Motors a substantial portion of its paint requirements was due to the superior quality of Duco and Dulux and to du Pont's continuing research and outstanding service, and that \"du Pont's position was at all times a matter of sales effort and keeping General Motors satisfied. There is no evidence that General Motors or any Division of General Motors was ever prevented by du Pont from using a finish manufactured by one of du Pont's competitors; nor is there any evidence that \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 638]\n\u00a0\n General Motors has suffered competitively from its substantial use of Duco.\" (Emphasis supplied.) 126 F. Supp., at 296.\n\n2. Fabrics. - The principal fabrics which du Pont has sold to General Motors are imitation leather (du Pont's \"Fabrikoid\" and \"Fabrilite\") and top material for open cars and convertibles (du Pont's \"Pontop,\" \"Everbright\" and \"Teal\").\n25\n Its sales of these materials to General Motors in 1947 totaled $3,369,000, or about 38.5% of General Motors' total purchases of such materials. In earlier years, before closed cars with all metal tops came to predominate, these materials constituted a larger proportion of the total fabrics used in an automobile than they do today. By 1946 they averaged, apart from the top material for convertibles, only about 1.6 yards, costing about $2.22 per car. They are used principally for seat tops and backs, kick pads, rear shelves, etc. Du Pont does not manufacture the cotton and wool products of which most of the upholstery is composed.\n\nDu Pont entered the manufacture of coated fabrics in 1910, when it purchased the Fabrikoid Company of Newburgh. New York. \"Artificial leather,\" as it was then \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 639]\n\u00a0\n known, was of poor quality and had very limited areas of acceptance. As du Pont succeeded in improving both its quality and appearance, its use rapidly broadened. By mid-1913, du Pont Fabrikoid, a pyroxylin-coated fabric, had been accepted by the automobile industry for upholstery and interior trim. Three years later, in 1916, almost every automobile company was a purchaser of Fabrikoid, and a contemporary du Pont estimate in that year stated that 60% of all cars produced in the United States would be equipped with Fabrikoid. In that same year, du Pont rounded out its line of fabrics by acquiring the Fairfield Rubber Company, a manufacturer of rubber-coated fabrics. Du Pont thus had achieved, before it purchased its General Motors' stock, a leading position in the automotive fabric field. Before 1917, it was supplying substantially all of the coated fabrics requirements at Chevrolet and Oldsmobile, about half of the requirements at Buick, and about a third of the requirements at Oakland. At the Cadillac division, du Pont supplied all of the coated fabrics for interior trim but none of the top material. 126 F. Supp., at 296-297.\n\nAlthough there have been variations from year to year and from one car division to another in response to competitive considerations, du Pont generally has maintained its pre-1917 position as the principal supplier of coated and combined fabrics to General Motors. In 1926, General Motors purchased about 55.5% of these fabrics from du Pont, largely because Chevrolet switched entirely to du Pont after an unfortunate experience with competitive products during the preceding year. By 1930, the proportion had declined to about 31.5%, and du Pont was selling more fabrics to Ford than to General Motors. At the time of suit, du Pont's share had increased to 38.5% the remainder being supplied by du Pont's competitors. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 640]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to the mass of evidence supporting the District Court's finding that \"such purchases of fabrics as the General Motors divisions have made from du Pont from time to time were based upon each division's exercise of its business judgment and are not the result of du Pont domination\" (emphasis supplied), 126 F. Supp., at 301, the record clearly indicates that du Pont's fabrics can and have made their way in the automotive industry on their merits. Prior to the early 1920's, du Pont was the principal supplier of coated fabrics to all three of the then major producers - Ford, Willys-Overland and General Motors. After Ford and Willys began to produce their own coated fabrics they still turned to du Pont for much of what they could not produce. Chrysler purchased substantial amounts from du Pont until, in the early 1930's, it embarked on its policy of one principal supplier for each product and chose Textileather, a du Pont competitor. Du Pont has continued to be Ford's largest supplier for the material which it does not manufacture for itself. Du Pont likewise has supplied, over the years, a considerable part of the coated and combined fabrics of most of the smaller automobile companies.\n\nThe District Court did not err in concluding that \"Du Pont, the record shows, has maintained its position as the principal fabric supplier to General Motors through its early leadership in the field and by concentrating upon satisfactorily meeting General Motors' changing requirements as to quality, service and delivery.\" (Emphasis supplied.) 126 F. Supp., at 301.\n\n3. Other Products. - The Court concludes only that du Pont has been given an unlawful preference with respect to paints and fabrics. By limiting the issue to these products, it eliminates from deserved consideration those products which General Motors does not buy in \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 641]\n\u00a0\n large quantities or proportions from du Pont.\n26\n Yet the logic of the Court's argument - that the stock relationship between du Pont and General Motors inevitably has or will result in a preference for du Pont products - requires consideration of the total commercial relations between the two companies. Du Pont \"influence,\" if there were any, would be expected to apply to all products which du Pont makes and which General Motors buys.\n\nHowever, the evidence shows that du Pont has attempted to sell to the various General Motors' divisions a wide range of products in addition to paint and fabrics, and that it has succeeded in doing so only when these divisions, exercising their own independent business judgment, have decided on the basis of quality, service and price that their economic interests would best be served by purchasing from du Pont. Six such groups of products were considered in detail by the District Court: \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 642]\n\u00a0\n plastics, brake fluid, casehardening materials, electroplating materials, safety glass, and synthetic rubber and rubber chemicals. 126 F. Supp., at 319-324. A few examples drawn from the findings will suffice.\n\nDu Pont's sales to General Motors of celluloid (du Pont's \"Pyralin\"), used as windows in the side curtains of early automobiles, initially declined in 1918 after the stock purchase, and only revived when an improved product was adopted by all the large auto manufacturers. Instead of purchasing brake fluid and safety glass from du Pont, General Motors embarked, during the 1930's, on its own production of these substantial items. With respect to casehardening materials, General Motors has purchased less than half of its requirements from du Pont, while other auto manufacturers have purchased amounts larger in proportion and quantity. Although du Pont's new electroplating processes were widely adopted in the automobile and other industries in the 1930's only Cadillac has used du Pont's processes exclusively, Oldsmobile and Pontiac have used it occasionally, and Chevrolet and Buick never have used it except for brief periods. Neoprene, a synthetic rubber developed by du Pont, has been used to a much greater extent by Chrysler and Ford than by General Motors. Chrysler also uses, and helped develop, du Pont's synthetic rubber adhesive for brake linings, but the General Motors' divisions prefer a more expensive type of synthetic rubber.\n\nThe record supports the conclusion of the District Court:\n\n \"All of the evidence bearing upon du Pont's efforts to sell these various miscellaneous products to General Motors supports a finding that the latter bought or refused to buy solely in accordance with the dictates of its own purchasing judgment. There is no evidence that General Motors was constrained to favor, or buy, a product solely because it was offered \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 643]\n\u00a0\n by du Pont. On the other hand, the record discloses numerous instances in which General Motors rejected du Pont's products in favor of those of one of its competitors. The variety of situations and circumstances in which such rejections occurred satisfies the Court that there was no limitation whatsoever upon General Motors' freedom to buy or to refuse to buy from du Pont as it pleased.\" (Emphasis supplied.) 126 F. Supp., at 324.\n\n\n Evidence Relied on by the Court. - The Court, disregarding the mass of evidence supporting the District Court's conclusion that General Motors purchased du Pont paint and fabrics solely because of their competitive merit, relies for its contrary conclusion on passages drawn from several documents written during the years 1918-1926, and on the logical fallacy that because du Pont over a long period supplied a substantial portion of General Motors' requirements of paint and fabrics, its position must have been obtained by misuse of its stock interest rather than competitive considerations.\n\nThe isolated instances of alleged pressure or intent to obtain noncompetitive preferences are four: (1) the Raskob report of December 1917; (2) several letters of J. A. Haskell, written during 1918-1920; (3) certain reports and letters of Pierre and Lammot du Pont during 1921-1924; and (4) a 1926 letter of John L. Pratt. Passages drawn from these 1918-1926 documents do not justify the conclusion reached by the Court. Each of them is a matter of disputed significance which cannot be evaluated without passing on the motivation and intent of the author. Each failed to achieve its specific object. Read in the context of the situations to which they were addressed, each is entirely consistent with the finding of the District Court that, although du Pont was trying to get as much General Motors' business as it could, there was no restriction on General Motors' freedom \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 644]\n\u00a0\n to buy as it chose, and that General Motors' buyers did not regard themselves as in any way limited.\n27\n Moreover, even if isolated paragraphs in these documents, taken from their context, are given some significance, and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 645]\n\u00a0\n the other evidence relating to the period from 1918 to 1926 is entirely ignored, all of the evidence after 1926 affirmatively establishes without essential contradiction that du Pont did not use its stock interest to receive any preferential treatment from General Motors.\n\nNor can present illegality be presumed from the bare fact that du Pont has continued to make substantial sales of several products to General Motors.\n28\n In the first place, the record affirmatively shows that the new products which du Pont has sold to General Motors since 1926 have made their way, at General Motors as elsewhere, on their merits. Sales of Duco, Dulux, Fabrilite and Teal are not attributable in any way to dealings in the earlier period. Secondly, the Court's presumption is based on the fact that du Pont does not sell to all other automobile manufacturers in the same proportion as it does to General Motors. But there is no reason why it should - the Government has not shown that sellers normally sell to all members of an industry in the same proportion. In any event, the record fully explains the disproportion. Since 1930, du Pont's sales to other members of the industry have proportionately declined, largely because Ford has chosen to make the major share of its requirements of paint and fabrics, and because Chrysler has followed the policy of selecting a single supplier to whom it can be the most important customer. The fact is that du Pont has continued to sell in substantial amounts to the smaller members of the automobile industry. The growth in the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 646]\n\u00a0\n dominance of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - companies which together account for more than 85% of automobile production - when combined with the policies adopted by Ford and Chrysler, adequately explains why du Pont sells a larger proportion of paint and fabrics to General Motors than it does to the industry as a whole.\n\nIt is true that 7 of the Clayton Act does not require proof of actual anticompetitive effects or proof of an intent to restrain trade. But these matters become crucial when the Court rests its conclusion that du Pont's stock interest violates the Act on evidence relating solely to an alleged du Pont intent to obtain a noncompetitive preference from General Motors, and on a finding that such a preference was actually secured through the unlawful use of du Pont's stock interest. Preference and intent are also relevant because the Government has brought this case 30 years after the event. If no actual restraint has occurred during this long period, the probability of a restraint in the future is indeed slight. Especially is this so when the only change in recent years has been in the direction of diminishing du Pont's participation in General Motors' affairs.\n\nRule 52 (a) Governs This Case. - The foregoing summary of the evidence relating to General Motors' purchases of paint and fabrics from du Pont, comparatively brief as it is, reveals that a multitude of factual issues underlie this case. The occurrence of events, the reasons why these events took place, and the motives of the men who participated in them are drawn in question. The issue of credibility is of great importance. The District Judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and to judge their credibility at first hand. Thus, this case is a proper one for the application of the principle embodied in Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, \n329 \nU.S. 861\n: \"Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 647]\n\u00a0\n due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\" United States v. Oregon Medical Society, \n343 \nU.S. 326, 330\n-332, 339; United States v. Yellow Cab Co., \n338 \nU.S. 338, 341\n-342.\n\nThis is not a situation in which oral testimony is contradicted by contemporaneous documents. See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., \n333 \nU.S. 364\n. In this case, the findings of the District Court are supported both by contemporaneous documents and by oral testimony. For example, General Motors' search for a better automotive finish, the superiority of the product developed by du Pont, and General Motors' continuous efforts to secure an equally good lacquer from other sources are all proved by letters and reports written in the early 1920's as well as by the oral testimony of many witnesses. Similarly, contemporaneous exhibits prove that General Motors purchased fabrics from du Pont because of the superiority of du Pont products, and that on other occasions it turned to competing suppliers even though du Pont's product was just as good. Appellate review of detailed findings based on substantial oral testimony and corroborative documents must be limited to setting aside those that are clearly erroneous. The careful and detailed findings of fact of the District Court in this case cannot be so labeled.\n29\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 648]\n\u00a0\n\n\n   B. RELEVANT MARKET.\n\n\n Finally, even assuming the correctness of the Court's conclusion that du Pont's competitors have been or will be foreclosed from General Motors' paint and fabric trade, it is still necessary to resolve one more issue in favor of the Government in order to reverse the District Court. It is necessary to hold that the Government proved that this foreclosure involves a substantial share of the relevant \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 649]\n\u00a0\n market and that it significantly limits the competitive opportunities of others trading in that market.\n30\n\u00a0\n\nThe relevant market is the \"area of effective competition\" within which the defendants operate. Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 293, 299\n-300, n. 5. \"[T]he problem of defining a market turns on discovering patterns of trade which are followed in practice.\" United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 110 F. Supp. 295, 303, aff'd per curiam, \n347 \nU.S. 521\n. \"Determination of the competitive market for commodities depends on how different from one another are the offered commodities in character or use, how far buyers will go to substitute one commodity for another.\" United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n351 \nU.S. 377, 393\n. This determination is primarily one of fact.\n\nThe Court holds that the relevant market in this case is the automotive market for finishes and fabrics, and not the total industrial market for these products. The Court reaches that conclusion because in its view \"automotive finishes and fabrics have sufficient peculiar characteristics \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 650]\n\u00a0\n and uses to constitute them products sufficiently distinct from all other finishes and fabrics . . . .\" Ante, pp. 593-594. We are not told what these \"peculiar characteristics\" are. Nothing is said about finishes other than that Duco represented an important contribution to the process of manufacturing automobiles. Nothing is said about fabrics other than that sales to the automobile industry are made by means of bids rather than fixed price schedules. Dulux is included in the \"automobile\" market even though it is used on refrigerators and other appliances, but not on automobiles. So are other finishes and fabrics used on diesel locomotives, engines, parts, appliances and other products which General Motors manufactures. Arbitrary conclusions are not an adequate substitute for analysis of the pertinent facts contained in the record.\n\nThe record does not show that the fabrics and finishes used in the manufacture of automobiles have peculiar characteristics differentiating them from the finishes and fabrics used in other industries. What evidence there is in the record affirmatively indicates the contrary. The sales of the four products principally involved in this case - Duco, Dulux, imitation leather, and coated fabrics - support this conclusion.\n\nDuco was first marketed not to General Motors, but to the auto refinishing trade and to manufacturers of furniture, brush handles and pencils. In 1927, 44% of du Pont's sales of colored Duco, and 51.5% of its total sales, were to purchasers other than auto manufacturers. Although the record does not disclose exact figures for all years, it does show that a substantial portion of du Pont's sales of Duco have continued to be for nonautomotive uses.\n31\n\u00a0\n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 651]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is also significant that Duco was a patented product. Prior to the expiration of the patent in 1944, only five years before this suit was brought, du Pont issued over 250 licenses - to all that applied - covering its patented process. If Duco is to be treated as a separate market solely because of its initial superiority, du Pont is being penalized rather than rewarded for contributing to technological advance.\n\nDulux has never been used in the manufacture of automobiles. It replaced Duco and other lacquers as a finish on refrigerators, washers, dryers, and other appliances, and continues to have wide use on metallic objects requiring a durable finish. Yet the Court includes it as a finish having the unspecified but \"peculiar characteristics\" distinctive of \"automotive finishes.\" Ante, p. 593. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 652]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 1947, when du Pont's sales of Duco and Dulux to General Motors totaled about $15,400,000, the total national market for paints and finishes was $1,248,000,000, of which about $552,000,000 was for varnishes, lacquers, enamels, japans, thinners and dopes, the kinds of finishes sold primarily to industrial users.\n32\n There is no evidence in this record establishing that these industrial finishes are not competitive with Duco and Dulux. There is considerable evidence that many of them are. It is probable that du Pont's total sales of finishes to General Motors in 1947 constituted less than 3.5% of all sales of industrial finishes.\n\nThe record also shows that the types of fabrics used for automobile trim and convertible tops - imitation leather and coated fabrics - are used in the manufacture of innumerable products, such as luggage, furniture, railroad upholstery, books, brief cases, baby carriages, hassocks, bicycle saddles, sporting goods, footwear, belts and table mats. In 1947, General Motors purchased about $9,454,000 of imitation leather and coated fabrics. Of this amount, $3,639,000 was purchased from du Pont (38.5%) and $5,815,000 from over 50 du Pont competitors. Since du Pont produced about 10% of the national market for these products in 1946, 1947 and 1948, and since only 20% of its sales were to the automobile industry, the du Pont sales to the automobile industry constituted only about 2% of the total market. The Court ignores the record by treating this small fraction of the total market as a market of distinct products.\n\nIt will not do merely to stress the large size of these two corporations. The figures as to their total sales - \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 653]\n\u00a0\n $793,000,000 for du Pont and $3,815,000,000 for General Motors in 1947 - do not fairly reflect the volume of commerce involved in this case. The commerce involved here is about $19,000,000 of industrial finishes and about $3,700,000 of certain industrial fabrics - less than 3.5% of the national market for industrial finishes, and only about 1.6% of the national market for these fabrics. The Clayton Act is not violated unless the stock acquisition substantially threatens the competitive opportunities available to others. International Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, \n280 \nU.S. 291\n; Transamerica Corp. v. Board of Governors, 206 F.2d 163; V. Vivaudou, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 54 F.2d 273. The effect on the market for the product, not that on the transactions of the acquired company, is controlling. Fargo Glass & Paint Co. v. Globe American Corp., 201 F.2d 534.\n33\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court might be justified in holding that products sold to the automotive industry constitute the relevant \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 654]\n\u00a0\n market in the case of products such as carburetors or tires which are sold primarily to automobile manufacturers. But the sale of Duco, Dulux, imitation leather, and coated fabrics is not so limited.\n\nThe burden was on the Government to prove that a substantial share of the relevant market would, in all probability, be affected by du Pont's 23% stock interest in General Motors. The Government proved only that du Pont's sales of finishes and fabrics to General Motors were large in volume, and that General Motors was the leading manufacturer of automobiles during the later years covered by the record. The Government did not show that the identical products were not used on a large scale for many other purposes in many other industries. Nor did the Government show that the automobile industry in general, or General Motors in particular, comprised a large or substantial share of the total market. What evidence there is in the record affirmatively indicates that the products involved do have wide use in many industries, and that an insubstantial portion of this total market would be affected even if an unlawful preference existed or were probable.\n\nFor the reasons stated, I conclude that 7 of the Clayton Act, prior to its amendment in 1950, did not apply to vertical acquisitions; that the Government failed to prove that there was a reasonable probability at the time of the stock acquisition (1917-1919) of a restraint of commerce or a tendency toward monopoly; and that, in any event, the District Court was not clearly in error in concluding that the Government failed to prove that du Pont's competitors have been or may be foreclosed from a substantial share of the relevant market. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the District Court. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 655]\n\u00a0\n\n\n  APPENDIX TO MR. JUSTICE BURTON'S DISSENT.\n\n\n\"SEC. 7. That no corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce.\n\n\n\"No corporation shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of two or more corporations engaged in commerce where the effect of such acquisition, or the use of such stock by the voting or granting of proxies or otherwise, may be to substantially lessen competition between such corporations, or any of them, whose stock or other share capital is so acquired, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce.\n\n\n\"This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, the substantial lessening of competition. Nor shall anything contained in this section prevent a corporation engaged in commerce from causing the formation of subsidiary corporations for the actual carrying on of their immediate lawful business, or the natural and legitimate branches or extensions thereof, or from owning and holding all or a part of the stock of such subsidiary corporations, when the effect of such formation is not to substantially lessen competition.\n\n\n\"Nor shall anything herein contained be construed to prohibit any common carrier subject to the laws to regulate commerce from aiding in the construction of branches \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 656]\n\u00a0\n or short lines so located as to become feeders to the main line of the company so aiding in such construction or from acquiring or owning all or any part of the stock of such branch lines, nor to prevent any such common carrier from acquiring and owning all or any part of the stock of a branch or short line constructed by an independent company where there is no substantial competition between the company owning the branch line so constructed and the company owning the main line acquiring the property or an interest therein, nor to prevent such common carrier from extending any of its lines through the medium of the acquisition of stock or otherwise of any other such common carrier where there is no substantial competition between the company extending its lines and the company whose stock, property, or an interest therein is so acquired.\n\n\n\"Nothing contained in this section shall be held to affect or impair any right heretofore legally acquired: Provided, That nothing in this section shall be held or construed to authorize or make lawful anything heretofore prohibited or made illegal by the antitrust laws, nor to exempt any person from the penal provisions thereof or the civil remedies therein provided.\" 38 Stat. 731-732, 15 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 18.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ronald Fabrics Co. v. Verney Brunswick Mills, Inc., CCH Trade Cases \u00a7 57,514 (D.C. S. D. N. Y. 1946), discussed infra, n. 10, was a private action for treble damages.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Transamerica Corp. v. Board of Governors, 206 F.2d 163 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1953), involved a series of stock acquisitions over many years, some of which took place at about the time of suit.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 18, was amended in 1950 so as to broaden its application, 64 Stat. 1125, 15 U.S.C. 18. The amendments, by their terms, were inapplicable to acquisitions made before 1950. Thus this case is governed by the original language of 7 and not by 7, as amended.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] One of the earliest rulings of the Federal Trade Commission was that 7 did not prohibit asset acquisitions. 1 F. T. C. 541-542. The primary purpose of the 1950 amendments was to bring asset acquisitions within 7. Proponents of the 1950 amendments asserted on several occasions that the omission of asset acquisitions in the original Clayton Act had been inadvertent. See, e. g., 96 Cong. Rec. 16443. However, the legislative history of the Clayton Act demonstrates that the purpose of 7 was to prevent the formation of holding companies and certain evils peculiar to stock acquisitions, particularly the secrecy of ownership. See 51 Cong. Rec. 9073, 14254, 14316, 14420, 14456; H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 17; S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 13.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The remarks of Senator Chilton relied on by the majority, ante, p. 591, do not indicate that he thought that 7 was applicable to vertical acquisitions. His statements indicate merely that he thought that the restraint and monopoly clauses of 7 were not entirely synonymous with the substantially lessen competition clause.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See, e. g., 51 Cong. Rec. 9270-9271 (Representative Carlin); id., at 9554 (Representative Barkley); id., at 14254-14255 (Senator Cummins); id., at 14313 (Senator Reed); id., at 15856-15861 (Senator Walsh); id., at 15940 (Senator Nelson); id., at 16001 (Senator Chilton); id., at 16320 (Representative Floyd).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 51 Cong. Rec. 14455. Senator Reed had offered an amendment to the first paragraph of 7 which would have prevented a corporation from acquiring stock in another corporation engaged in the same line of business. This was an attempt to stiffen the bill in order to relieve the Government from proving that competition had been substantially lessened by the acquisition, an element of proof which he, Senator Cummins, and others thought would be quite difficult. See 51 Cong. Rec. 14254-14255, 14419-14420. Senator Chilton asked Senator Reed whether his amendment would prevent a corporation engaged in the manufacture of steel from acquiring stock in a corporation \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 615]\n\u00a0\n engaged in the production of iron ore. Senator Reed replied that his amendment would not bar such an acquisition, but that neither would the bill as written:\n\n\"But I call the Senator's attention to the fact that if the illustration he uses would not be covered by the language of my amendment it certainly would not be covered by the language I seek to amend. His argument would go as much against that, and even more than against my amendment. I do not claim that this will stop everything. I claim that it will be a long step in that direction.\" Id., at 14455. No one disputed Senator Reed's interpretation of 7.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See, e. g., the statement by Representative Carlin, one of the managers of the bill in the House, to the effect that the interlocking directorate provision contained in 8 would prevent a director of a corporation which supplied railroads with materials from becoming a railroad director and, in effect, \"buy[ing] supplies from himself.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 9272.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See, e. g., F. T. C., Ann. Rep. for Fiscal Year 1929, 6-7, 60, where the Commission stated that it could take no corrective action under \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 616]\n\u00a0\n the Clayton Act against large consolidations in the food industry \"even though the consolidation was effected through the acquisition or exchange of capital stock,\" because \"most of these consolidations and acquisitions were of corporations engaged in the distribution of allied but noncompetitive products.\" See also, F. T. C., Ann. Rep. for Fiscal Year 1927, 13-15; Statement by General Counsel Kelley in Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on H. R. 2734, 81st Cong., 1st and 2d Sess. 37; Report of the Federal Trade Commission on Interlocking Directorates, H. R. Doc. No. 652, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In the Ronald Fabrics case, a rayon converter alleged that a competing corporation had restrained commerce by acquiring control of a source of supply of rayon. The District Court held that this allegation stated a cause of action under 7 of the Clayton Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] A minority in the Senate, led by Senators Cummins and Walsh, sought to strike out the \"tend to create a monopoly\" language of 7. 51 Cong. Rec. 14314-14316, 14319, 14459-14461. They argued that this language was superfluous because the creation of a monopoly always substantially lessened competition, and because the Sherman Act contained similar language, and that there was a danger that the language would be considered as an implied repeal of the Sherman Act. The failure of these efforts to eliminate the tendency toward monopoly clause (the restraint of commerce clause had not been added \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 618]\n\u00a0\n to 7 at this time) indicates that the tendency toward monopoly clause was not intended to be limited to situations already encompassed by the substantially lessen competition clause. Similarly, the remarks of Senator Chilton, quoted by the Court from 51 Cong. Rec. 16002, ante, pp. 591-592, indicate that he thought the tendency toward monopoly and restraint of commerce clauses added something. But I find no evidence that what they did add included vertical acquisitions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Federal Trade Commission v. Western Meat Co., \n272 \nU.S. 554, 561\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] It might be argued that the mention of subsequent misuse in the third paragraph of 7, the investment proviso, enlarges the substantive content of the first paragraph of 7. This paragraph provides that \"This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, the substantial lessening of competition.\" But the mention of use in this paragraph has the effect of limiting the exception it contains, i. e., the exception for stock purchased \"solely for investment.\" This exception is lost if the stock is subsequently misused. But the exception contained in this paragraph does not come into play unless the acquisition first comes within the substantive prohibition of the first two paragraphs of 7. This limitation on the exception cannot expand the substantive prohibition to which the exception applies.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] It may be that 7 is inapplicable when the Government fails to bring suit within a reasonable period after the consummation of the stock acquisition. If so, the 30 years here involved would exceed a reasonable period of incipiency. Even though 7 of the Clayton Act, under this theory, would be inapplicable, any alleged restraint could be dealt with under the Sherman Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The Court apparently concedes that du Pont's stock acquisition in General Motors was lawful when made because \"its sales to General Motors were relatively insignificant\" at that time and because \"General Motors then produced only about 11% of the total automobile production . . . .\" Ante, p. 599. Throughout, the Court stresses the growth in size of General Motors. Ante, pp. 595-596, 599. The decline in the number of automobile manufacturers is not mentioned, but is well known. And the Court states that diffusion of General Motors' stock through the years has increased \"The potency of the influence of du Pont's 23% stock interest . . . .\" Ante, p. 607, n. 36.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Except in this case, the enforcing agencies appear never to have brought an action under 7 more than four years after the date of the acquisition. Consequently, the precise problem raised here has not been directly adjudicated. Nevertheless, the cases cited in the text spell out the proof required for a violation of 7, and thus have an important bearing on this problem.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Cf. United States v. Columbia Steel Co., \n334 \nU.S. 495\n, holding that even the exclusion of competition resulting from complete vertical integration does not violate the Sherman Act unless competition in a substantial portion of a market is restrained.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The following table compares General Motors' purchases, in 1947, of several products from du Pont with its purchases of the same products from competitors of du Pont. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    Purchases Purchases Total  Percent   Type of product  from  from  General of purchases    du Pont  competitors Motors' from      of du Pont  purchases  du Pont ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finishes __________________ $18,724,000 $8,635,000  $27,359,000  68.4 Fabrics (imitation leather and coated fabrics) ______  3,639,000  5,815,000 9,454,000  38.5 Adhesives _________________  12,000  3,056,000 3,068,000 .4 Chemicals: Anodes ___________________  2,000  1,206,000 1,208,000 .2 Solvents _________________ 439,000  3,183,000 3,622,000  12.1   --------------------------------------------------------------    $22,816,000 $21,895,000  $44,711,000  51.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] The following table compares du Pont's total sales of industrial finishes in recent years with its sales of the same finishes to General Motors:\n\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------     Sales to General Motors   Sales to       Total finish  General  Year  Other   sales  Motors   Duco  finishes Total    as percent         of total         sales ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1938 __________ $4,569,604  $1,625,625  $6,195,229 $31,357,134  19.8 1939 ___________ 6,312,005 2,448,844 8,760,849  38,514,763  22.7 1940 ___________ 8,876,970 2,850,091  11,727,061  44,974,778  26.1 1941 ___________ 9,768,119 3,757,389  13,525,508  61,204,127  22.1 1946 ___________ 6,911,596 3,518,256  10,429,852  75,117,079  13.9 1947 __________ 12,224,798 6,713,431  18,938,229 105,266,655  18.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe years 1942 through 1945 are omitted from all tables because of the suspension of automobile production during the war.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] In 1947, a typical year, General Motors' total purchases of all products from du Pont were $26,628,274. Of this amount, $18,938,229, or 71% of the total, was finishes.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] In 1947, over 400 paint manufacturers other than du Pont sold finishes to General Motors. The total amount they sold was $8,635,000, 31.6% of General Motors' requirements. Twenty-five companies, other than du Pont, each sold amounts of finishes to General Motors in excess of $30,000 in that year; one company sold as much as $3,205,000.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] In 1947, General Motors' purchases of industrial finishes from du Pont, by type of finish, were as follows:\n\nDuco ................................... $12,224,798  65% Dulux ..................................  3,179,225  17 All Others .............................  3,534,206  18      ----------- ----      $18,938,229 100%\n\n Thus, Duco and Dulux comprised 82% of du Pont's finish sales to General Motors in that year.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Du Pont initially sold more Duco to other auto manufacturers than it did to General Motors. In 1926, du Pont's sales of colored Duco were distributed as follows: to General Motors, 19%; to other auto manufacturers, 33%; to all others, 48%. The primary market for clear Duco has always been the furniture industry.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] For example, Van Derau, a Westinghouse executive, testified that his company bought its entire requirements of refrigerator finishes from du Pont because of du Pont's quality and service:\n\n\"Now, another factor - and I think I can say this without it being harmful to any other suppliers - du Pont has the finest trained technical group at their beck and call, at the beck and call of the users of the materials, of anybody in the business and we have had several times, when we have had a little problem, and I am thinking of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 636]\n\u00a0\n one in particular where we were going to find it very difficult to keep in production until the trouble would be overcome, which I called from Pittsburgh to the Chicago office, and the next morning one of the men of du Pont was on the job, and within a very few hours they had materials coming in from their Toledo plant that kept us in production.\n\n\n\"You cannot laugh off that kind of service. They have been simply excellent, and I don't know how you could say, any better.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] The following table compares du Pont's total sales of industrial fabrics, primarily imitation leather and coated fabrics, in several recent years, with the sales of those same products to General Motors: --------------------------------------------------------------------------         GM sales   Year Sales to Sales to  Total sales  as percent      GM  others  of total         sales -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1938 _____________________ $446,357  $6,647,112  $7,093,469 6.6 1939 ______________________ 803,854 7,775,778 8,579,632 9.4 1940 ____________________ 1,285,280 7,780,105 9,065,385 14.2 1941 ____________________ 1,773,079  13,093,469  14,866,548 11.9 1946 ____________________ 2,083,166  14,170,639  16,253,805 12.8 1947 ____________________ 3,639,316  16,723,610  20,362,926 17.9 -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] The following table compares the dollar amount, in 1947, of du Pont's total sales of the products of its various departments with the amount sold by it to General Motors: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------         Sales to      Du Pont sales  Total du  General   Type of product to General Pont sales Motors, as       Motors percent of         total sales ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finishes ___________________________ $18,938,229  $105,266,655 18.0 Fabrics _____________________________ 3,639,316 20,362,926 17.9 Ammonia ______________________________ 1,742,416 50,320,207  3.5 Grasselli Chemicals __________________ 1,024,320 74,212,311  1.4 Electrochemicals _____________________ 1,019,272 47,687,843  2.1 Plastics _______________________________ 105,422 34,828,026  0.3 Organic Chemicals _______________________ 83,254 94,632,256  0.1 Rayon ___________________________________ 45,616 250,467,514 ([*]) Explosives ______________________________ 26,032 58,875,482 ([*]) Pigments _________________________________ 3,530 31,496,024 ([*]) Photo Products _____________________________ 867 25,699,756 ([*])\n\n     $26,628,274  $793,849,000  3.4\n\n\n [*] Less than 0.1%.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] Because the Court quotes fully from, and appears to place special weight on, the 1926 letter of J.

It has, therefore, comparatively little bearing on du Pont's intent. Moreover, it is significant that Pratt's attitude toward du Pont was based not on the stock relationship, but on the fact that du Pont saved General Motors from financial disaster in 1920. His views, apparently, would have been the same whether or not du Pont owned stock in General Motors. In any event, all that Pratt says is that, in making purchases, General Motors should \"always keep a competitive situation,\" and \"the prime consideration is to do the best thing for Delco-Light Company . . . .\" (Pratt was writing to the general manager of Delco, a General Motors' division.)\n\nAn examination of the circumstances in which this letter was written disposes of any notion that it expressed a policy that General Motors should prefer du Pont's products when they were equal in quality, service and price. The circumstances were these: Delco Light was buying paint from a competitor of du Pont. When the competitor failed to solve a paint problem which confronted Delco, it called on du Pont for help. However, although du Pont solved the problem and obtained one order for paint, Delco asked du Pont to withhold delivery so that the competitor could be given another opportunity to retain the business. Understandingly, Elms of the du Pont Paint Department was somewhat piqued by this, and he wrote a personal letter to his friend Pratt asking for his assistance. Pratt's letter to the general manager of Delco was the result.\n\nDespite the fact that the du Pont product was offered at a lower price and the fact that the technical staff at Delco thought the du Pont product superior, Delco nevertheless continued to buy from the competitor. Du Pont never did receive the business to which the correspondence related. Judged by either its content or its result, the Pratt letter is a poor example of an alleged du Pont policy of \"purposely employ[ing] its stock to pry open the General Motors market . . . .\" Ante, p. 606.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] The Court, without referring to any supporting evidence, ventures the conjecture that \"General Motors probably turned to outside sources of supply at least in part because its requirements outstripped du Pont's production . . . .\" Ante, p. 605. As I read the record, du Pont was actively soliciting more business from General Motors and others throughout the period covered in this suit. I find no hint that du Pont was surfeited with business and unable to fill General Motors' orders.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] The Court also overturns the District Court's express finding that du Pont purchased General Motors' stock solely for investment. The Court does this on the basis of an alleged du Pont purpose to secure a noncompetitive preference which the Court finds expressed in the Raskob letter and in certain statements in du Pont's 1917 and 1918 reports to its stockholders. These documents, however, are not inconsistent with the District Court's finding of an investment purpose. The District Court said:\n\n\"Raskob's report, the testimony of Pierre S. and Irenee du Pont and all the circumstances leading up to du Pont's acquisition of this \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 648]\n\u00a0\n substantial interest in General Motors, as shown by the record, establish that the acquisition was essentially an investment. Its motivation was the profitable employment of a large part of the surplus which du Pont had available and uncommitted to expansion of its own business.\n\n .   .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"Raskob's reports and other documents written at or near the time of the investment show that du Pont's representatives were well aware that General Motors was a large consumer of products of the kind offered by du Pont. Raskob, for one, thought that du Pont would ultimately get all that business, but there is no evidence that Raskob expected to secure General Motors trade by imposing any limitation upon its freedom to buy from suppliers of its choice. Other documents also establish du Pont's continued interest in selling to General Motors - even to the extent of the latter's entire requirements - but they similarly make no suggestion that the desired result was to be achieved by limiting General Motors purchasing freedom. On the contrary, a number of them explicitly recognized that General Motors trade could only be secured on a competitive basis.\" 126 F. Supp., at 242, 243.\n\n\n Whether any stock purchase is an investment turns largely on the intent of the purchaser. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission. 66 F.2d 37, aff'd by an equally divided court, \n291 \nU.S. 651\n. In this case, since the District Court's finding with reference to that intent is unequivocal and not clearly erroneous, the stock acquisition falls within the proviso, stated in the third paragraph of 7, expressly excepting acquisitions made \"solely for investment.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] The District Court did not reach this question since it found that there was no reasonable probability of any foreclosure of du Pont's competitors by reason of du Pont's 23% stock interest in General Motors. Consequently, there are no findings of fact dealing with the relevant market. Also, the record appears deficient on such crucial questions as the characteristics of the products, the uses to which they are put, the extent to which they are interchangeable with competitors' products, and so on. For these reasons, I believe the Court in any event should remand the case to the District Court to give the District Judge, who is more familiar with the record than we can be, an opportunity to review the record, and entertain argument with respect to the substantiality of the share of the relevant market affected by the foreclosure which the Court finds to exist. By declining to remand, the Court necessitates a scrutiny here of this huge record for a determination of an essentially factual question not passed on by the District Court, and not thoroughly briefed or argued by the parties.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] The Court states that \"General Motors took 93% of du Pont's automobile Duco production in 1941 and 83% in 1947.\" Ante, p. 605. These figures are of little significance. Not only do they omit the \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 651]\n\u00a0\n crucial sales - those made outside the automobile industry - but they give a misleading impression with respect to du Pont's sales to the automobile industry. As previously stated, Ford chose to make its own requirements after about 1935 and Chrysler desired to concentrate its purchases on one supplier. Under these figures, after eliminating Ford and Chrysler, and deducting du Pont's sales to General Motors, du Pont must have supplied nearly half of the entire requirements of all remaining auto manufacturers in 1941 and an even larger portion in 1947.\n\nThe record does not contain complete figures on the amount of Duco sold outside the automobile industry. However, there are figures for selected years. In 1927, for example, 51.5% of all Duco sales were to other than automobile manufacturers (1,166,220 gallons, out of a total of 2,263,000 gallons). In 1948, du Pont's gross sales to purchasers other than General Motors of the same kinds of finishes bought by General Motors amounted to about $97,000,000; its sales to General Motors in the same year were $21,000,000, or 21.7% of the total. The record reveals that General Motors' purchases of finishes from du Pont have ranged, in recent years, from 14% to 26% of du Pont's sales of such finishes to all customers. The conclusion seems clear that du Pont's finishes have found wide acceptance in innumerable industries and that du Pont is not dependent on General Motors for a captive paint market.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, II Census of Manufactures: 1947, Statistics by Industry, 414-415. There were 1,291 establishments manufacturing these products. Du Pont's total sales were 8.1% of the industry.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] In the Fargo case, Maytag, an appliance manufacturer, acquired a 40% stock interest in, and contracted to purchase the entire output of, Globe, a gas range manufacturer. A Globe dealer, who lost his source of supply as a result of the transaction, brought a treble damage action alleging, inter alia, that the stock acquisition violated 7 of the Clayton Act. The evidence showed that there were about 70 manufacturers of gas ranges, and that Globe was about eighteenth in size, selling a little less than 2% of the national market (about $5,000,000 a year). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the stock acquisition did not violate 7 because the plaintiff had other readily available sources of supply.\n\nThe acquisition of an outlet is governed by similar principles. In either case, the question is whether competitors may be substantially limited in their competitive opportunities. Assuming that du Pont had purchased General Motors outright, and thus commanded an outlet consuming about 4% of the national market for industrial finishes and about 2% of the national market for industrial fabrics, it seems unlikely that du Pont's paint and fabric competitors would be substantially limited in selling their products, when 96% and 98%, respectively, of the national market would remain open to them. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 586, 657]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nA federal criminal information was filed by the United States against Ludenia Howard, trading as Stokes Fish Company, appellee, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charging her with a violation of the Federal Black Bass Act of May 20, 1926, as amended, c. 346, 44 Stat. 576, 46 Stat. 845, 61 Stat. 517, 66 Stat. 736, 16 U.S.C. 851-854. The Act provides:\n\n\"It shall be unlawful for any person to deliver . . . for transportation . . . from any State . . . any black bass or other fish, if (1) such transportation is contrary to the law of the State . . . from which such . . . fish . . . is to be transported . . . .\" 16 U.S.C. 852.\n\n\n The information stated that appellee delivered fish for transportation across the Florida border contrary to the \"laws of the State of Florida.\" The relevant fishing provisions consisted of the rules and regulations of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission and a criminal penalty imposed by the legislature for violation of the rules. The District Court, however, held that the rules and regulations do not constitute the \"law of\" Florida within the meaning of the Black Bass Act and on appellee's motion quashed the information. An appeal was brought here by the United States pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3731. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n351 \nU.S. 980\n.\n\nFlorida's Game Commission was created by a 1942 constitutional amendment (Art. IV, 30, Constitution of Florida) which provides that:\n\n\"after January 1, 1943, the management, restoration, conservation, and regulation, of the . . . fresh-water fish, of the State of Florida . . . shall be vested in [the] Commission . . . .\" \n\n[352 \nU.S. 212, 214]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n It was empowered by the same amendment\n\n\"to fix bag limits and to fix open and closed seasons, on a state-wide, regional or local basis, as it may find to be appropriate, and to regulate the manner and method of taking, transporting, storing and using . . . fresh-water fish . . . .\"\n\n\n The amendment further provides:\n\n\"The Legislature may enact any laws in aid of . . . the provisions of this amendment . . . . All laws fixing penalties for the violation of the provisions of this amendment . . . shall be enacted by the legislature from time to time.\"\n\n\n Pursuant to this amendment, the Florida Legislature authorized the Commission to exercise\n\n\"the powers, duties and authority granted by 30, article IV, of the constitution of Florida, by the adoption of rules, regulations and orders . . . .\" Fla. Stat. Ann., 1943, 372.021.\n\n\n Another statute makes it a misdemeanor to violate\n\n\"any rule, regulation or order of the game and fresh water fish commission . . . .\" Fla. Stat., 1955,  372.83.\n\n\n Rule 14.01 of the Commission's rules prohibits the transportation of certain fresh fish outside the State; it is this regulation that Ludenia Howard is accused of breaking.\n1\n Because the information was quashed for failure to state a federal crime, we assume the alleged acts of appellee \n\n[352 \nU.S. 212, 215]\n\u00a0\n occurred and that she is subject to criminal prosecution in Florida pursuant to 372.83 of the Florida Statutes, as set out above.\n\nThe sole question presented is whether Rule 14.01 of the Commission's regulations, as enforced by 372.83 of the Florida Statutes, is a \"law\" of the State of Florida as that term is used in the Federal Act.\n\nThis Court has repeatedly ruled, in other circumstances, that orders of state administrative agencies are the law of the State. In Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Indiana R. Comm'n, \n221 \nU.S. 400, 403\n, the Court stated, citing Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 226\n:\n\n\"the other [of the Indiana Railroad Commission] . . . is a law of the State within the meaning of the contract clause of the Constitution . . . .\"\n\n\n And, in Lake Erie & W. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n, \n249 \nU.S. 422, 424\n, it was said that an order of the state public utilities commission \"being legislative in its nature . . . is a state law within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress regulating our jurisdiction.\" A similar statement may be found in Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis S. W. R. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 141\n.\n\nIt was suggested that the action of the court below is supported by United States v. Eaton, \n144 \nU.S. 677\n. We believe the case is inapposite. It involved the regulation of manufacturers and dealers in oleomargarine under 24 Stat. 209. Section 18 of the Act provided a criminal penalty for the knowing or willful failure \"to do, or cause to be done, any of the things required by law.\" Section 5 required manufacturers to keep certain records. A similar requirement was imposed upon wholesalers by a regulation made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue pursuant to 20. The defendant in the Eaton case, a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 212, 216]\n\u00a0\n wholesaler, failed to keep the proper records, but this Court held he had not committed a crime under 18:\n\n \"Regulations prescribed by the President and by the heads of departments, under authority granted by Congress, may be regulations prescribed by law, so as lawfully to support acts done under them and in accordance with them, and may thus have, in a proper sense, the force of law; but it does not follow that a thing required by them is a thing so required by law as to make the neglect to do the thing a criminal offence in a citizen, where a statute does not distinctly make the neglect in question a criminal offence.\" Id., at 688.\n\n\n The Court made particular mention of the fact that the Act expressly required manufacturers to keep certain books, but made no such requirement of wholesalers. Id.\n2\n In Singer v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 338, 345\n, we said:\n\n\"United States v. Eaton turned on its special facts, as United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506, 518\n-519, emphasizes. It has not been construed to state a fixed principle that a regulation can never be a `law' for purposes of criminal prosecutions. It may or may not be, depending on the structure of the particular statute.\"\n\n\n See also Caha v. United States, \n152 \nU.S. 211, 219\n. Here, it is beyond question that the Florida Legislature, in Fla. Stat. 372.83, intended to and did make infraction \n\n[352 \nU.S. 212, 217]\n\u00a0\n of any commission regulation a violation of state law, punishable as a misdemeanor.\n\nAppellee argues that the rules of the Florida Commission are so subject to change that they lack sufficient substance and permanence to be the \"law\" of Florida. We need not decide now whether a state agency could make a rule of such a temporary nature and so unaccompanied by the procedural niceties of rule making that the declaration should not be considered the law of the State for purposes of a statute such as the Black Bass Act. These considerations formed no part of the opinion below. Moreover appellee has not demonstrated that the rule here involved is of such a character.\n\nCommission promulgation of orders is regulated by 372.021 of 14 Fla. Stat. Ann., a legislative enactment. It provides that no regulation or amendment to a regulation is effective until 30 days after the filing of a certified copy of such provisions with the secretary of state. The statute also directs that any change in the type of regulation involved here is to be filed in the office of each county judge and that changes must be published in each county in a newspaper of general circulation.\n3\n We are advised by the Government's brief that the Commission compiles its rules in a code book which is circulated without cost to all county judges, as is directed by statute, and also to principal sporting goods and license dealers. In fact they seem to be available to anyone requesting them from the Commission. We are also told that it is the Commission's practice to conduct public hearings to give \n\n[352 \nU.S. 212, 218]\n\u00a0\n everyone an opportunity to air his own views on proposed changes in the rules. None of these assertions is challenged by appellee.\n\nWe recognize that not all the above-described procedures are mandatory and that whether any of them was employed with the enactment of Rule 14.01 cannot be ascertained from the record at this time. However, the fact that it is the asserted practice of the Commission to comply with them suggests a potent answer to appellee's charge of impermanence. Moreover, it is not inappropriate for us to note that transportation of some species of fish covered by this information has been prohibited in Florida since 1927. Fla. Stat. Ann., 1943, 372.29, Florida Laws, 1929, c. 13644, 35.\n\nThe State of Florida prefers to entrust the regulation of its wild life conservation program to a Game Commission. Such a preference is in accordance with the practice of 28 States that have vested full regulatory authority in commissions. Only 6 States reserve that full authority to their legislatures. Sport Fishing Institute Bulletin, No. 26, p. 60 (January 1954). Moreover, a document prepared by the Department of the Interior and submitted to us by the Government at our request shows that even in 1926, the year the Black Bass Act was first passed, significant rule-making power was entrusted to game commissions or commissioners in some 20 States.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThat the congressional purpose was to extend the enforcement guarantees of the Black Bass Act to these regulations is the most reasonable interpretation of the Act and is an interpretation supported by the legislative history of the 1947 amendment to the Act. The amendment, \n\n[352 \nU.S. 212, 219]\n\u00a0\n which made the provisions of the Act applicable to all game fish, was accompanied by Senate and House reports containing the following language:\n\n\"The bill is intended to supplement State laws applying to protection of game fish. . . . State laws become ineffectual when fish taken in violation of the law cross the State line. If we are to protect game fish, an important natural resource, the Federal Government must collaborate in the enforcement of protective laws and regulations at the point where State jurisdiction ends.\" S. Rep. No. 288, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 2; H. R. Rep. No. 986, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n Accordingly we hold that the phrase \"law of the State,\" as used in this Act, is sufficiently broad to encompass the type of regulation used in Florida.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"No person . . . shall . . . transport, transport for sale, or transport out of the State of Florida any large or small mouth black bass, speckled perch, jack, shell cracker, warmouth perch, red breast, pike, stump knocker, sun fish, or Canadian sunfish, or any other species of bream; . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Court also paid special note to the fact that subsequent to the alleged acts of Eaton, but prior to its decision, Congress amended the Oleomargarine Act to expressly require the keeping of books by wholesalers. \n144 \nU.S., at 685\n-686, 688.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and Robert G. Maysack.\n\nRobert A. Sprecher argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Simon Herr and Frank A. Karaba.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe respondent, Walter Korpan, was indicted in a Federal District Court in Illinois for willfully failing to pay the $250 per device tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. (Supp. IV) 4461 on any person who maintains for use any gaming device. For purposes of this tax, 26 U.S.C. (Supp. IV) 4462 (a) defines gaming devices as:\n\n\"so-called `slot' machines which operate by means of insertion of a coin . . . and which, by application \n\n[354 \nU.S. 271, 272]\n\u00a0\n of the element of chance, may deliver, or entitle the person playing . . . the machine to receive cash, premiums, merchandise, or tokens.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 271, 273]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The evidence at the trial showed that Korpan maintained on his premises a number of coin-operated gambling machines. These machines were played by inserting a coin into the machine through a slot. The player was then able to shoot several balls onto a playing surface which was interspersed with pockets or holes. If he succeeded in getting balls into certain holes he received a varying number of free games. He had the option of either playing the free games or of cashing them in at a designated rate. By inserting extra coins the player could sometimes secure additional balls or increased \"odds\" (in other words, increase the number of free games he could win). The machines were equipped with electrical devices which over a period of time controlled the number of free games won.\n\nThe district judge found respondent guilty as charged and fined him $750. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that respondent's machines did not come within the definition laid down by 4462 (a) (2). 237 F.2d 676. On the Government's petition we granted certiorari because the case raised important questions in the administration of the revenue laws. \n352 \nU.S. 980\n. The issue before us is whether the machines maintained by petitioner were included within the definition given by 4462 (a) (2).\n2\n For the reasons stated hereafter we believe that they were within that definition and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals setting aside Korpan's conviction on the ground that they were not must be reversed.\n\nIt is clear that respondent's machines were operated by the insertion of a coin and that persons playing them could receive cash for any free games won. The machines also involved an element of chance sufficient \n\n[354 \nU.S. 271, 274]\n\u00a0\n to meet the requirements of 4462 (a) (2), although skill may have had some part in playing them successfully. In short, they were \"slot-machine\" gambling devices.\n\nRespondent argues, however, that when Congress used the phrase \"so-called `slot' machines\" in 4462 (a) (2) it intended to restrict the scope of that section to those \"slot machines\" gambling devices colloquially known as \"one-armed bandits.\" He describes the latter as machines in which the insertion of a coin releases a lever or handle which, in turn, when pulled activates a series of spring-driven drums or reels with various insignia painted thereon, usually bells and fruit, and which automatically dispense coins to a player when certain combinations of these insignia are aligned. The Government, on the other hand, takes the position that Congress intended to cover all \"slot machines\" which come within the specific requirements of 4462 (a) (2). It argues that the qualifying phrase \"so-called\" was added because (1) the draftsmen were apprehensive that the term \"slot-machine\" might be a slang expression not accepted as proper English or (2) they wanted to cover every gambling device operated by the insertion of coins through a slot even though the device might go under a label other than \"slot machine.\"\n\nOn its face the language of 4462 (a) (2) and related sections does not manifest an intent to limit the application of the otherwise broad terms of 4462 (a) (2) to any particular kind of \"slot-machine\" gambling device. The phrase \"so-called `slot' machine\" is, if anything, more consistent with the position advanced by the Government than that taken by Korpan. And the remainder of 4462 (a) (2), as well as 4462 (c), has language which affirmatively suggests that 4462 (a) (2) was designed to include all sorts of coin-operated gambling devices regardless \n\n[354 \nU.S. 271, 275]\n\u00a0\n of their particular structure or the method by which they paid off players.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by the relevant legislative history. Apart from the amount of tax imposed, 4462 (a) (2) is substantially the same as its original predecessor, 3267 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, 55 Stat. 722. Senator Clark, the sponsor of the amendment which became 3267, declared during the Senate debates on his amendment that his objective was to impose a heavy tax on \"any machine which returns any sort of a premium, and that was the intention of the amendment, and it was the intention of the committee in adopting it.\"\n3\n The Senate report which accompanied Clark's amendment stated:\n\n \"The House bill places a special tax of $25 per year upon each coin-operated amusement or gaming device maintained for use on any premises.\n\n\n \"Your committee divides these devices into two categories. Upon so-called pinball or other amusement devices operated by the insertion of a coin or token, the tax is reduced to $10 per year. Upon so-called slot machines, however, the tax is placed at $200 per year.\"\n4\n (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Respondent contends that this report as well as similar language in other parts of the legislative history is indicative of an intent on the part of Congress to draw a distinction between \"one-armed bandits\" and other coin-operated gambling or amusement machines.\n5\n We interpret this history, however, as demonstrating a congressional \n\n[354 \nU.S. 271, 276]\n\u00a0\n purpose to place a heavy tax on all \"slot-machine\" gambling devices, regardless of their particular structure, and a substantially smaller tax on machines played purely for amusement which offered the player no expectation of receiving \"cash, premiums, merchandise, or tokens.\"\n\nThe administrative interpretation of 4462 (a) (2) and its predecessors adds additional strength to this view. In 1942 the Treasury Department published interpretative regulations which included so-called \"pin-ball\" gambling machines under 4462 (a) (2).\n6\n This administrative ruling was publicized in the trade paper of the coin-operated machine industry. In both 1942 and 1954 the representatives of that industry complained to Congress about the Treasury's interpretation, which is still in effect, and asked that 4462 (a) (2) be amended so that it expressly excluded \"pin-ball\" gambling machines.\n7\n In each instance Congress left the existing provisions of 4462 (a) (2) standing, although, at the request of others in the industry, it did provide an exception for certain penny-operated gambling machines.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIf the respondent's position were adopted 4462 (a) (2) would be restricted to a peculiar type of gambling device - the so-called \"one-armed bandit\" - even though ingenuity, a desire to avoid taxes, and technological \n\n[354 \nU.S. 271, 277]\n\u00a0\n progress provide a multitude of new devices which permit substantially the same kind of gambling but only with a different kind of coin-operated machine. We are convinced that Congress had no such purpose and meant only to distinguish between \"slot-machines\" operated as gambling devices and \"slot-machines\" which were used exclusively for amusement.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents from the conclusion that here pin ball machines are games of chance within the meaning of the statute.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In full the pertinent statutory provisions read as follows: \" 4461. IMPOSITION OF TAX. \"There shall be imposed a special tax to be paid by every person who maintains for use or permits the use of, on any place or premises occupied by him, a coin-operated amusement or gaming device at the following rates: \"(1) $10 a year, in the case of a device defined in paragraph (1) of section 4462 (a); \"(2) $250 a year, in the case of a device defined in paragraph (2) of section 4462 (a); and \"(3) $10 or $250 a year, as the case may be, for each additional device so maintained or the use of which is so permitted. If one such device is replaced by another, such other device shall not be considered an additional device. \" 4462. DEFINITION OF COIN-OPERATED AMUSEMENT OR GAMING  DEVICE. \"(a) In general. \"As used in sections 4461 to 4463, inclusive, the term `coin-operated amusement or gaming device' means - \"(1) any amusement or music machine operated by means of the insertion of a coin, token, or similar object, and \"(2) so-called `slot' machines which operate by means of insertion of a coin, token, or similar object and which, by application of the element of chance, may deliver, or entitle the person playing or operating the machine to receive cash, premiums, merchandise, or tokens. \"(b) Exclusion. \"The term `coin-operated amusement or gaming device' does not include bona fide vending machines in which are not incorporated gaming or amusement features. \"(c) 1-cent vending machine. \"For purposes of sections 4461 to 4463, inclusive, a vending machine operated by means of the insertion of a 1-cent coin, which, when it dispenses a prize, never dispenses a prize of a retail value of, or entitles a person to receive a prize of a retail value of, more than 5 cents, and if the only prize dispensed is merchandise and not cash or tokens, shall be classified under paragraph (1) and not under paragraph (2) of subsection (a).\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Respondent contends that 4462 (a) (2) as interpreted by the District Court is unconstitutionally vague.

CO.(1957)\nNo. 45\nArgued: November 20, 1957Decided: December 16, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Pursuant to 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940, the Government paid upon presentation and prior to audit bills presented by respondent railroad for transporting government property in 1944. On post-audit, the Government found that it had been overcharged and, upon refusal of respondent to refund the amount of the overcharge, deducted the amount from a bill for transportation services rendered by respondent in 1950. Respondent then sued the Government under the Tucker Act for the full amount of the 1950 bill. In its answer, the Government admitted the 1950 bill but claimed credit for the 1944 overcharge and its payment of the difference by check. Respondent then admitted receipt of the check, but claimed that the remainder of the 1950 bill was due and unpaid. Held: Respondent has the burden of proving that its 1944 charges were computed at lawful and authorized rates, and it is entitled to recovery only if it satisfies that burden. Pp. 254-264.\n\n (a) It is clear from the legislative history of 322 that both Congress and the railroads contemplated that the Government's protection against overcharges available under the preaudit practice should not be diminished and that the burden of the carriers to establish the correctness of their charges was to continue unabridged. Pp. 255-260.\n\n\n (b) The burden of the carrier to establish the lawfulness of its charges is the same under 322 as it was under the superseded practice, under which payment was withheld until the carrier established the correctness of its charges. Pp. 260-262.\n\n\n (c) Conventional principles of contractual setoff should not govern the determination of the carrier's burden of proof in this action merely because the complaint frames an action for recovery of the full amount of the 1950 bill rather than the amount deducted therefrom. Pp. 262-263.\n\n\n 236 F.2d 101, reversed and remanded. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 254]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlan S. Rosenthal argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Doub and Melvin Richter.\n\nEdmund M. Sweeney argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe General Accounting Office audited transportation bills of the respondent, rendered and paid in 1944, and determined that the Government was overcharged in the amount of $1,025.26. When the respondent did not refund this amount on demand, the Government exercised the right, reserved in 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940,\n1\n to deduct the overpayments from a subsequent bill. The Government credited that amount against a bill of the respondent, admittedly owing, of $1,143.03 for 1950 transportation services, and paid the balance of $117.77 by check.\n\nThe respondent thereupon brought this action under the Tucker Act\n2\n in the District Court for Massachusetts. The complaint seeks recovery not of the $1,025.26 deducted, but of the full amount of the 1950 bill of $1,143.03. The Government's answer admits the 1950 \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 255]\n\u00a0\n bill but pleads its payment by the check of $117.77 and the credit of $1,025.26 in liquidation of the overcharges determined in the 1944 bills. The respondent filed a pleading in response to the government answer\n3\n admitting \"that it did receive the check in the amount of $117.77, all as recited by the defendant, leaving the balance due and to this date unpaid in the amount of $1025.26.\"\n\nThe question presented in both courts below, and in this Court, is whether in this action the carrier has the burden of proving the correctness of the 1944 bills, or the Government the burden of proving that it was overcharged. The District Court held that the respondent carrier was pleading on a contract against which the Government was attempting to \"set off\" claims under other contracts, and that \"whoever attempts to set off the other contractual claims has the burden of showing there are other claims.\" In the absence of government evidence proving the claimed overcharges in the 1944 bills, a motion of the respondent for summary judgment was granted. The judgment entered, however, was for $402.84, because the respondent accepted the amount of 1944 overcharges in the difference between that sum and the amount of the bill. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the judgment. 236 F.2d 101. We granted certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 965\n.\n\nBefore enactment of 322, the Government protected itself against transportation overcharges by not paying transportation bills until the responsible government officers, and, in doubtful cases, the General Accounting Office, first audited the bills and found that the charges were correct.\n4\n When charges were questioned the carrier \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 256]\n\u00a0\n was required to justify them. If administrative settlement was not reached and the carrier sued the United States to recover the amount of the bill, no one questions that it was the carrier's duty to sustain the burden of proving the correctness of the charges.\n5\n Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 445, 448\n.\n\nSection 322, however, required the payment of such bills \"upon presentation . . . prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting Office . . . .\" The audit procedures \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 257]\n\u00a0\n remained substantially the same as those in effect prior to the statute but the former means of protecting against overcharges - by not paying the bills until their correctness was proved - has, by force of the statute, been replaced by the method of collecting them from subsequent bills, under the right reserved by the section to the Government \"to deduct the amount of any overpayment to any such carrier from any amount subsequently found to be due such carrier.\" We recently said in United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 59, 74\n:\n\n\". . . This right [to deduct overpayment from subsequent bills of the carrier] was thought to be a necessary measure to protect the Government, since carriers' bills must be paid on presentation and before audit.\"\n\n\n Again at page 75:\n\n\"The fact that the Government paid the carrier's bills as rendered is without significance in light of  322 of the Transportation Act, supra, requiring payment `upon presentation' of such bills and postponing final settlement until audit.\"\n\n\n This interpretation of 322 finds full support in the legislative history of the section. The section was included in the omnibus transportation bill, which became the Transportation Act of 1940, in direct response to a demand of the railroads for legislation relieving them of the inordinate delays in payment of their bills attributable to the preaudit procedure, which tied up substantial amounts of accounts receivable and contributed to the financial difficulties which confronted the railroads during the depression years. The then President of the Association of American Railroads raised the issue in a letter to the Procurement Division of the Department of the Treasury dated October 5, 1937. (See Appendix to \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 258]\n\u00a0\n this opinion, post, p. 264.) Proposed legislation in almost the identical language which became 322 was thereupon introduced in 1938.\n6\n It failed of passage in the Seventy-fifth Congress and a number of similar proposals were therefore introduced in the Seventy-sixth Congress.\n7\n None of these passed, but in the following year the provision was included as 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIt is entirely clear that although the railroads sought, in the words of their spokesman, \"corrective action . . . that will render impossible such long delays in payment for services rendered,\" to gain that end the railroads recognized that any remedy suggested on their behalf should be \"both practical and legal and [one] which can easily be made operative without the assumption of any risk insofar as the Government is concerned.\" It was \"with this thought in mind\" that the railroads proposed the elimination of preaudit procedures and the prompt payment of transportation bills when rendered, with audit \"after payment . . . [of] these bills referred to the General Accounting Office or such other governmental auditing \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 259]\n\u00a0\n office as might be desired for audit.\" The plan contemplated that \"in the event . . . this audit reveals an over-payment\" the same \"will be promptly paid by the railway, preserving, however, the right of the carrier to make further effort to recollect in the event that it does not believe the proper charges resulted from the Government's audit.\"\n9\n\u00a0\n\nIn hearings before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce held June 1, 1938,\n10\n in connection with one of the bills incorporating the proposal which became 322, the then General Counsel of the Association of American Railroads, arguing in support of the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 260]\n\u00a0\n proposal, urged that \"[i]f that section could be put in here, it would require the payment of the bills by the Government as they are rendered by the railroads, with the privilege, however, of course, if it should develop that there has been an overpayment, the Government may deduct that amount from subsequent bills.\"\n\nThe conclusion is inescapable from this history that the Congress was desirous of aiding the railroads to secure prompt payment of their charges,\n11\n but it is also clear that the Congress, and the railroads, contemplated that the Government's protection against overcharges available under the preaudit practice should not be diminished. The burden of the carriers to establish the correctness of their charges was to continue unabridged. The carriers were to be paid immediately upon submission of their bills but the carriers were in return promptly to refund overcharges when such charges were administratively determined. The carrier would then have \"to recollect\" the sum refunded by justifying its bills to the agency or by proving its claim in the courts. The footing upon which each of the parties stood when controversies over charges developed was not to be changed. The right of the United States to deduct overpayments from subsequent bills was the carriers' own proposal for securing the Government against the burden of having to prove the overpayment in proceedings for reimbursement.\n\nIn the light of this history, we are unable to agree with the holdings of the Court of Appeals that \"[a]ll that 322 does is to authorize and direct disbursing officers of the United States to pay transportation bills upon presentation, without waiting for audit or settlement by the General \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 261]\n\u00a0\n Accounting Office,\" and that the reservation of the right of offset against subsequent bills is without significance - \"We suppose that this provision was inserted out of an abundance of caution, because the availability of a setoff by the United States need not depend upon specific statutory authorization,\" citing Gratiot v. United States, 15 Pet. 336, 370. 236 F.2d 101, 105.\n\nNor do we share the view of the Court of Appeals that \"the position of the United States as shipper, so far as the present case is concerned, is no different from that of a private shipper.\" Id., at 104. Even if we assume that \"[i]f a private shipper or consignee should pay the carrier before satisfying himself of the correctness of the charges demanded - as he may be required to do pursuant to 3 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A. 3 (2) and regulations of the Commission thereunder - and later sues for a refund of alleged overpayments, or seeks to set off the amount of the overpayments against another claim admittedly due, in either case the shipper or consignee would have the burden of alleging and proving the fact and the amount of such overpayment,\"\n12\n the Court of Appeals overlooks the fact that the Government's statutory right of setoff was designed to be the substantial equivalent of its previous right to withhold payment altogether until the carrier established the correctness of its charges. Thus the issue of overcharges, after the enactment of 322, arises in a different way, but the differing procedures by which the issue is presented should not control the placement of the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 262]\n\u00a0\n burden of proof.\n13\n In effect the situation is that the railroad is suing to recover amounts which the Government initially paid conditionally, and then recaptured, under the 322 procedure. We therefore hold that the burden of the carrier to establish the lawfulness of its charges is the same under 322 as it was under the superseded practice.\n\nSimilarly, conventional principles of contractual setoff should not govern the determination of the carrier's burden of proof in this action merely because the complaint \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 263]\n\u00a0\n frames an action for recovery of the full amount of the 1950 bill rather than the amount deducted therefrom. The respondent's brief concedes that \"[w]henever a railroad brings an action against the Government, directly upon the deduction [as, on the facts of the case, to recover the alleged 1944 overpayments], it has the burden of alleging and proving the facts of the case and establishing the validity of its claim in the light of the contract and the applicable tariffs.\" There is also authority that the plaintiff has the same burden, although suing on the subsequent bill, when the claim for damages is for the amount of the deduction. Suncook Mills v. United States, 44 F. Supp. 744; Eastport S. S. Co. v. United States, 131 Ct. Cl. 210, 130 F. Supp. 333; Buch Express, Inc. v. United States, 132 Ct. Cl. 772, 132 F. Supp. 473.\n14\n We do not see that a different issue was shaped by the pleadings in this action. Cf. Wisconsin Central R. Co. v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 190, 212\n. Although the ad damnum clause of the complaint prays recovery of $1,143.03, respondent's pleading filed in response to the Government's answer admits the government payment of $117.77, and that the actual controversy concerns the balance of $1,025.26. The true dispute between the parties, arising from the determination and collection of the overpayments as authorized by 322, involves the lawfulness of the 1944 bills. It is the substance, not the form, which should be our concern. Cf. Alcoa S. S. Co. v. United States, \n338 \nU.S. 421\n; Reynolds v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 443\n. We hold that the respondent is entitled to recover only if it satisfies its \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 264]\n\u00a0\n burden of proving that its 1944 charges were computed at lawful and authorized rates.\n\nWe do not here intimate that the administrative determination of overpayment has binding effect in the judicial proceeding, see Wisconsin Central R. Co. v. United States, supra, at 211; Grand Trunk Western R. Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 112, 120\n-121; and we agree with the Court of Appeals that the extrinsic fact, namely the availability of the freight cars in the sizes ordered, remains to be proved in the suit. Our conclusion is that the burden in that respect is upon the carrier.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed with direction to remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER dissents, on the basis of the opinion of Chief Judge Magruder in the court below, 236 F.2d 101, and more particularly because the respondent was not the initial carrier.\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n The letter, dated October 5, 1937, was addressed by J. J. Pelley, President of the Association of American Railroads, to Captain H. E. Collins, Assistant Director, Procurement Division, Treasury Department, and reads:\n\n\"Dear Captain COLLINS:\n\n\n\"The railroads members of the Association of American Railroads, which comprise about 98% of all the Class I railroads in the United States, have been very much concerned by the long delay in securing payment for transportation services rendered for the U.S. Government. We know further, from conferences with the officers of the American Short Line Railroad Association, \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 265]\n\u00a0\n that their lines have been and are experiencing similar difficulty. These delays are not justified and the carriers should not be expected to finance the Government as they are now doing, insofar as transportation is concerned. Furthermore, the railroads are necessarily large borrowers and in that connection are required as a condition to their obtaining the necessary capital to pay substantial interest charges on all such borrowed money, whereas on the other hand the Government is paying no interest on its delayed payments to the railroad companies, which delays in many instances run over a year and invariably are not settled for sixty to ninety days. Although the railroads pay interest for the money they borrow, they cannot under the law collect interest from the Government no matter how long settlements may be delayed. This is obviously unfair.\n\n\n\"Under the law applicable to commercial shippers, transactions with railroads are required to be on substantially a cash basis. Shippers are required to pay freight charges within 48 hours, on a majority of the traffic, and in no case are they permitted credit in excess of 96 hours. It appears to us, and particularly under the present unfortunate financial position of the railroads, that the carriers ought to receive settlement from the Government within 96 hours after a bill has been presented and that would be possible providing the proper machinery were set up and the proper instructions issued.\n\n\n\"This matter is of very much greater importance today than it has been in years past, for the reason that under present conditions the Government is engaged in shipping to a very much greater extent than ever before. Due to the various bureaus and other agencies, particularly in connection with relief work and in connection with some of the governmental corporations that have been organized, the Government is today handling much tonnage which was previously commercial traffic so that the delay \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 266]\n\u00a0\n in settlement for the transportation charges is much more serious to the railroads today than would have been the case a decade ago. It should also be borne in mind in connection with Government freight shipped under Government bills of lading the railroads are under the law not assessing their commercial rates but are making such discounts as the law requires because of land-grants and which in many instances today means the handling of this traffic on a basis below the actual cost of performing the service. These facts are mentioned only as indicating the very great importance of providing some sort of a system which will permit the more prompt payment of these charges.\n\n\n\"That you may have a picture of the situation, your attention is directed to the fact that as of July 1, 1937, there were 94,182 outstanding unpaid railroad bills against the Government amounting to $11,749,774, all of which bills had been rendered prior to May 1, 1937, and of these bills and this amount there was unpaid $4,683,946, representing 35,761 bills which had been rendered prior to January 1, 1937.\n\n\n\"We feel very sure that you and the other officers of the Government will agree that this situation is one that is grossly unfair and that corrective action should be taken that will render impossible such long delays in payment for services rendered.\n\n\n\"We are also of the opinion that it is not sufficient for us to simply complain of this situation but that in addition thereto we ought to suggest a remedy which in our judgment is both practical and legal and which can easily be made operative without the assumption of any risk insofar as the Government is concerned, providing you and your associates will put the suggested plan in operation and with such instructions issued as may be needed in connection therewith. With this thought in mind, we \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 267]\n\u00a0\n very respectfully submit for your consideration the following:\n\n\n\"We believe that the delay in the payment of transportation charges by the Government to the railroads would be absolutely avoided if the various departments contracting for transportation were instructed to pay the bills as rendered and after payment have these bills referred to the General Accounting Office or such other governmental auditing office as might be desired for audit. In the event that this audit reveals an over-payment, then claim be presented to the carrier for the amount thereof which will be promptly paid by the railway, preserving, however, the right of the carrier to make further effort to recollect in the event that it does not believe the proper charges resulted from the Government's audit. Attention is further directed to the fact that the railroads would never have, under such a plan, more money than the Government lawfully owed for the reason that the Government is shipping daily and is currently obligated to the railroad companies for transportation charges. This would place the handling of governmental transportation charges on substantially the same basis as applies in connection with commercial transactions.\n\n\n\"I am very sure from our previous negotiations with you and others connected with the Government with regard to the same subject that there exists no differences as between us as to the necessity of more prompt payment than has heretofore prevailed. I hope that you and your associates may consider the suggestions contained herein as reasonable and practical and that we may rely upon your good offices to bring about some such arrangement. It may be that you may desire to discuss this matter and perhaps make some suggestions that differ somewhat from the plan proposed herein. Should this situation develop, I want to assure you that either the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 253, 268]\n\u00a0\n officers of this Association or the appropriate officers of this Association with a committee of the lines will gladly discuss the subject with you at such time and place as may be mutually satisfactory. I feel sure that we both desire to obtain a very substantial improvement in the situation that now exists, and I am of the opinion that if these matters can be handled along lines somewhat similar to those which we have recommended that it will not only create a much better feeling as between the railroads and the Government, but in addition thereto will materially reduce the expenditures of both parties in the handling of these accounts and give to the railroads money which is due and greatly needed.\n\n\n\"With very kindest regards, I beg to remain.\n\n \"Yours most cordially,\n\n\n    \"(Signed) J.

A wartime measure permitted the charging of the tariffs applicable to the cars furnished if the carrier could not supply cars of the sizes ordered. 236 F.2d 101, 103. The General Accounting Office determined the overpayment on a finding that the documents showed that longer cars were furnished than were ordered. On the question of whether cars of the sizes ordered were available, the Government stated its position in answer to interrogations: \"Such information is peculiarly within the knowledge of plaintiff [respondent] and\/or the initial carrier . . . .\" The ordinary rule, based on considerations of fairness, does not place the burden upon a litigant of establishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge of his adversary.

A footnote to the Government's brief states:\n\n\"We are advised by the General Accounting Office that, during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1956, carriers refunded a total of $40,941,188.78.

A \"Memorandum Order as to Procedure in Common Carrier Cases,\" issued March 11, 1953, by the Court of Claims (now, with some amendments, included as Appendix B in the Rules of the Court of Claims, revised December 2, 1957), expressly defines the \"dispute\" in cases of the instant kind, among others, brought in that court:\n\n\"The word `dispute' . . . means the shipment or shipments with respect to which the General Accounting Office or other agency of the Government determined that the carrier's charges had been overpaid . . . rather than subsequent shipments which are not in dispute except for the fact that the overpayments determined as to the shipments in dispute have been deducted from the amount of the carrier's bills covering such subsequent shipments.\"\n\n\n The memorandum prescribes a procedure for the framing of the issues arising from the \"dispute\" as so defined. The carrier bringing the action must furnish a detailed schedule as to \"each of the carrier's bills for the shipments in dispute\" and is required also to file, at the time of its petition or within 30 days thereafter, \"a request for admission by the defendant [United States] of the genuineness of any relevant documents described in and exhibited with the request and of the truth of the material matters of fact relied on by the carrier for recovery in the action.\" The statements are expressly required to be \"sufficiently explicit to show the nature of the dispute and the specific reason or reasons why the plaintiff believes it is entitled to recover higher rates or charges than those allowed by the Government.\" Failure to comply with the requirements of the memorandum may be cause for the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal of the carrier's petition.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] But see Atlantic Coast Line R.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE BURTON join, dissenting.\n\nThe Court's action in overturning the judgment of the Court of Claims in this case, nearly a year and a half after we denied certiorari, and despite the subsequent denial of two successive petitions for rehearing, is so disturbing a departure from what I conceive to be sound procedure that I am constrained to dissent.\n\nThis is a tax case involving the right of the War Production Board to certify that only part of the actual cost of wartime facilities, constructed by a taxpayer at the instance of the Government, was necessary in the national defense and hence subject to accelerated amortization \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 100]\n\u00a0\n under 124 (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.\n1\n Claiming that the War Production Board had no power to certify less than the full cost of such facilities, the Ohio Power Company sued the Government in the Court of Claims to recover an alleged overpayment of taxes, asserting that it was entitled to accelerated amortization of the full cost of wartime facilities which it had constructed, and not merely of that part of the cost which the War Production Board had certified as necessary in the interest of national defense. The Court of Claims, sustaining this contention, entered judgment in favor of the taxpayer on March 1, 1955.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nOn August 12, 1955, the Government petitioned for certiorari, its time for filing having been duly extended. We denied the petition on October 17, 1955. \n350 \nU.S. 862\n. On November 10, 1955, the Government filed a timely petition for rehearing, requesting that its consideration be deferred until the case of Commissioner v. National Lead Co.,\n3\n involving this same tax question, had been decided by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We denied this petition on December 5, 1955. \n350 \nU.S. 919\n. On February 14, 1956, the Court of Appeals decided National Lead in favor of the Government,\n4\n and on April 3, 1956, the Court of Claims, in Allen-Bradley Co. v. United States,\n5\n decided the same tax question favorably to the taxpayer, as it had already done in the Ohio Power case. This, then, provided the Government with the \"conflict\" which had been lacking at the time when the Court denied its petition for certiorari in the present case. On this basis the Government, on \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 101]\n\u00a0\n May 3, 1956, petitioned for certiorari in Allen-Bradley,\n6\n and at the same time petitioned for leave to file a second petition for rehearing in the Ohio Power case. On May 28, 1956, the Court denied that petition because it was both long out of time and \"consecutive,\"\n7\n\u00a0\n351 \nU.S. 958\n, and thus for the third time refused to take the case. Nevertheless, two weeks thereafter, on June 11, 1956, the Court, incident to its grants of certiorari in the Allen-Bradley and National Lead cases, vacated sua sponte its order of December 5, 1955 denying the Government's original timely petition for rehearing in the Ohio Power case. \n351 \nU.S. 980\n. And today the Court grants that petition, some 16 months after it had originally been denied, and reverses the Court of Claims' judgment in favor of the taxpayer.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, today's order reversing the Court of Claims violates our own Rules. That order is based upon the Court's order of June 11, 1956, which vacated the order of December 5, 1955 denying the Government's first petition for rehearing of the denial of certiorari. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 102]\n\u00a0\n This June 11 order thus purported to continue consideration of the original petition for rehearing, which is now granted. Under our Rules, I think the order of June 11 was improvidently issued.\n8\n Had the Government, just prior to June 11, 1956, petitioned to vacate the order of December 5, 1955, the petition would have violated Rule 58 of our Revised Rules, whether considered as, in effect, a petition for rehearing of that order, in which case it would have been out of time, or as a petition for rehearing of the original denial of certiorari, in which case it would have been both out of time and \"consecutive.\"\n9\n To say that the order of June 11 could escape Rule 58 because it was made on the Court's initiative seems to me to involve the most hypertechnical sort of reasoning.\n\nIf we are to follow our Rules the order of June 11, and with it today's order, must fall, for this litigation must be considered to have been closed on December 5, 1955, when the Court denied the Government's first petition for rehearing.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nRule 58, by marking the end of a case in this Court, is intended to further the law's deep-rooted policy that adjudication must at some time become final. I think we should follow it. Prior to 1948, the outside limit of rules of finality in the federal courts was the end of the term, because, except for the extraordinary writs, federal courts were considered to have no power to deal with their \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 103]\n\u00a0\n judgments after the end of the term at which they were rendered. Bronson v. Schulten, \n104 \nU.S. 410, 415\n. In 1948 Congress abolished the \"end of term\" rule by a statute, 28 U.S.C. 452,\n10\n which was expressly made applicable to this Court. 28 U.S.C. 451. The effect of 452 was to leave the federal courts untrammeled in establishing their own rules of finality. But the history of 452 indicates that the courts were to have no power to re-examine their judgments otherwise than in accordance with their established rules or statutes. Section 452 was modeled on Rule 6 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n11\n See the Reviser's Note to 452, 28 U.S.C., p. 4142. As originally promulgated in 1938, Rule 6 (c) had referred only to the \"expiration of a term\" and not to its \"continued existence.\" In 1944 this Court held that a District Court had inherent power to vacate a judgment and enter a new one, with the effect of extending a party's right to appeal, notwithstanding such action was not authorized by any rule of the District Court, because the term had not yet expired. Hill v. Hawes, \n320 \nU.S. 520, 524\n. Thereafter, Rule 6 (c) was amended to provide that the \"continued existence or expiration\" of the term should not affect the power of a court. The purpose was \"to prevent reliance upon the continued existence of a term as a source of power to disturb the finality of a judgment upon grounds other than those stated in these rules.\" Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 104]\n\u00a0\n Procedure, Report of Proposed Amendments to Rules, H. R. Doc. No. 473, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 50 (1946). The \"continued existence or\" language of amended Rule 6 (c) was taken bodily into 452.\n\nThe history of 452 thus casts grave doubt, to say the least, on the power of the Court to do what it has done in this case, for its action was certainly not taken \"upon grounds . . . stated in [its] rules.\"\n12\n I recognize that 452 does not prevent the Court from changing its Rules, but if the statute means what its history suggests, such changes should be made on a general and not ad hoc basis, lest cases which are alike be treated differently.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThis Court, however, has never faced the problems raised by 452, but has proceeded on the assumption that the statute does not affect the Court's inherent power over its judgments; in other words, that by resorting to such power the Court may affect judgments by action which would otherwise be out of time under the Rules. If that view be correct, it follows that finality of adjudication in this Court ultimately depends on the Court's self-restraint. That, and the doubtful meaning of 452, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 105]\n\u00a0\n seem to me in any event to argue strongly against departures from Rule 58 - the only Rule of finality in this Court - except in rare instances. I now turn to the question of whether this is such a case.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe past practice of the Court shows that its inherent powers have always been exercised most sparingly. Thus, prior to enactment of 452 in 1948, the Court, so far as I can discover, had never in its history departed from the \"end of term\" rule by granting a petition for rehearing after the end of the term at which a judgment had been rendered.\n14\n Between 1948 and the effective date of Rule 58 (July 1, 1954), one of whose purposes was to tighten the rules ending litigation in this Court, I can find only four cases in which untimely relief was granted: Clark v. Manufacturers Trust Co., \n337 \nU.S. 953\n, vacated and remanded sub nom. McGrath v. Manufacturers Trust Co., \n338 \nU.S. 241\n; Goldbaum v. United States, \n347 \nU.S. 1007, 348\n U.S. 905; Banks v. United States, \n347 \nU.S. 1007, 348\n U.S. 905; McFee v. United States, \n347 \nU.S. 1007, 348\n U.S. 905.\n15\n Of these only Clark bears any similarity to this case.\n16\n Goldbaum, Banks and McFee were \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 106]\n\u00a0\n criminal \"net worth\" tax cases in which the Court, sua sponte, restored the cases to the docket pending decision of Holland v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 121\n, the cases thereafter being remanded for reconsideration in light of Holland. I need hardly say that the granting of untimely relief in criminal cases presents considerations not found in civil cases.\n\nOf particular significance here is what has happened since Rule 58 became effective. From then until today I have discovered but three cases in which the Court has granted rehearing out of time, all involving situations quite dissimilar to that presented here: Remmer v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 904\n; McNally v. Teets, \n352 \nU.S. 886\n; Achilli v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 1023\n.\n17\n Remmer was a criminal case which had been remanded to the lower court for further proceedings, and where the petition for \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 107]\n\u00a0\n rehearing raised questions which could again be brought to this Court on certiorari; rehearing thus served to avoid the delay and expense of further intermediate proceedings below, and hardly could be claimed to conflict with the policy of finality. McNally, also a criminal case, simply involved clarification of the Court's earlier order denying certiorari, in order to make clear that it covered two judgments below against the petitioner instead of only one. For lack of such a clarification, the petitioner's application for habeas corpus had been denied by a federal district court on the ground that, having failed to petition for certiorari from one of the two state decisions against him, he had not fully exhausted his state remedies. Achilli presented the same features as Remmer, in that it was a criminal case presenting a question that could again be raised in proceedings below and then brought to this Court in due course on certiorari. Indeed, exactly that happened in the Achilli case: petitioner, not anticipating this Court's willingness to reconsider its original denial of certiorari, raised the same question a second time before the District Court, obtained a new decision, and petitioned successfully for certiorari. \n353 \nU.S. 909\n. The net effect of the Court's untimely order, therefore, was to bring here more quickly a question that would arrive eventually in any case. Three other cases during this period, though not arising on petition for rehearing, may be considered to have involved out-of-time action by the Court: Florida ex rel. Hawkins v. Board of Control, \n350 \nU.S. 413\n; Boudoin v. Lykes Bros. S. S. Co., \n350 \nU.S. 811\n, and Cahill v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., \n351 \nU.S. 183\n. All of them, however, involved the correction of errors in the Court's own mandates, and not, as here, the overturning of another court's decision that had long since been permitted to become final.\n\nThe other side of the coin is also illuminating. I find that since 1948 there have been some 191 untimely applications \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 108]\n\u00a0\n for rehearing, or the equivalent,\n18\n as against only 10 instances of untimely action, 6 in response to applications and 4 on the Court's initiative. Since the adoption of Rule 58 in 1954, the Court has been asked on 40 occasions to grant rehearing out of time of orders denying certiorari,\n19\n and, with the exception of McNally v. Teets and Achilli v. United States, supra, cases that may fairly be described as unique, and that are certainly unlike this one, each time it has refused. In 13 of the 40 cases, relief was denied despite the claimed development of a conflict. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 109]\n\u00a0\n See Fraver v. Studebaker Corp., \n348 \nU.S. 939\n; Powell v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 939\n; Cowles Pub. Co. v. Labor Board, \n348 \nU.S. 960\n; Jones v. Lykes Bros. S. S. Co., \n348 \nU.S. 960\n; Lopiparo v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 969\n; Mondakota Gas Co. v. Montana-Dakota Utilities Co., \n349 \nU.S. 969\n; Zientek v. Reading Co., \n350 \nU.S. 960\n; Preferred Ins. Co. v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 990\n; International Molders & Foundry Workers v. Western Foundry Co., \n352 \nU.S. 860\n; Fairmont Aluminum Co. v. Commissioner, \n352 \nU.S. 913\n; Bernstein v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 977\n; Mekolichick v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 977\n; Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 1019\n.\n20\n\u00a0\n\nThis history of past practice justifies the assertion that the Court has exercised its inherent power with a sharp eye to the \"principle that litigation must at some definite point be brought to an end,\" Federal Trade Commission v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., \n344 \nU.S. 206, 213\n, and, in recent years at least, has acted only where it felt that the interests of justice plainly outweighed considerations of finality.\n\nWhat about this case? There is nothing to distinguish it from any other suit for a money judgment in which a conflict turns up long after certiorari and rehearing have been denied. The most that can be said in justification of the Court's action is that otherwise Ohio Power would not have to pay taxes which Allen-Bradley and National Lead must pay as a result of the much later decisions in their cases. Yet the Court twice faced and rejected that very possibility many months ago, (1) when it denied the Government's timely petition for rehearing, despite the request that consideration of it be deferred until the Court of Appeals had decided the National Lead case, and (2) when it denied the Government's second, and \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 110]\n\u00a0\n untimely, petition for rehearing in the face of the conflict with National Lead. And in any event, this is surely not the kind of injustice that warrants overriding the policy of finality of adjudication. What has happened here is commonplace; indeed it arises in every instance where the Court grants certiorari to settle any but the most recent conflict. Perhaps out-of-time action may be justified in some instances where the time interval between a finally decided case and a subsequent contrary decision of this Court is short. But we do not have that situation here, where more than 15 months elapsed between the denial of certiorari in Ohio Power (October 17, 1955) and our decisions in Allen-Bradley and National Lead (January 22, 1957), and where in the interval the Court had twice denied rehearing, with the very factors before it which are now said to justify its present action. If the rules of finality are to have real significance in this Court, I submit that by every token the taxpayer here was entitled to believe that its case had been irrevocably closed.\n\nThere is an additional reason why this case should not now be reopened. Had this case come to us from the Tax Court, our Court would have had no power to do what it has done, it being well established that when certiorari has been denied the power of this Court to affect decisions of the Tax Court ends with the denial of a petition for rehearing, or, where no such petition has been filed, with the running of the 25-day period within which rehearing may be sought. Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 1140, now Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 7481 (2) (B); R. Simpson & Co. v. Commissioner, \n321 \nU.S. 225\n; and see Helvering v. Northern Coal Co., \n293 \nU.S. 191\n. It is an odd circumstance that the Court should have re-affirmed this rule only a few weeks ago. Lasky v. Commissioner, \n352 \nU.S. 1027\n. The undesirability of according different treatment to tax cases arising from different \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 111]\n\u00a0\n sources scarcely requires comment. For me, this consideration alone is a sufficient reason for denying relief in this case.\n\nFor the reasons given I must dissent. I can think of nothing more unsettling to lawyers and litigants, and more disturbing to their confidence in the evenhandedness of the Court's processes, than to be left in the kind of uncertainty which today's action engenders, as to when their cases may be considered finally closed in this Court.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 54 Stat. 998-1003, as amended, 26 U.S.C. 23 (t), 124.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 131 Ct.

Paragraph 4 of Rule 58 provides: \"Consecutive petitions for rehearings, and petitions for rehearing that are out of time under this rule, will not be received.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The writer of this opinion, and those who join him, share in the responsibility for the issuance of the order of June 11.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Under the old Rules, it was not thought possible to petition for rehearing of a denial of rehearing. Such petitions were treated as miscaptioned untimely petitions for rehearing of the original order. Presumably the same practice obtains under the Revised Rules. Otherwise, an endless procession of \"timely\" petitions for rehearing could be filed, one every 25 days ad infinitum.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] So far as pertinent, 452 provides: \"The continued existence or expiration of a term of court in no way affects the power of the court to do any act or take any proceeding.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] \"The period of time provided for the doing of any act or the taking of any proceeding is not affected or limited by the continued existence or expiration of a term of court. The continued existence or expiration of a term of court in no way affects the power of a court to do any act or take any proceeding in any civil action which has been pending before it.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Text writers have disagreed as to the effect of 452. Compare Wiener, The Supreme Court's New Rules, 68 Harv. L.

Rules Civ. Proc., 60 (a) and (b), permitting applications for subsequent changes in judgments to be made on various grounds, it would be unfortunate to construe 452 as prohibiting this Court from exercising inherent power to correct judgments out of time for such things as fraud, mistake, and clerical error. To my way of thinking, it would be preferable to meet this problem by adding to our Rules, rather than by making ad hoc exceptions to Rule 58. The latter course, I fear, is bound to lead to the sort of thing that has happened in this case, leaving litigants in uncertainty as to when they may safely consider their cases closed in this Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] See Charles Elmore Cropley, Report of Survey by the Clerk of Rules and Practice in Relation to Petitions for Rehearing, Prepared by Direction of the Chief Justice, with Suggestions and Supporting Data (January 7, 1947).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See also California v. Zook, \n337 \nU.S. 921\n, in which a motion for leave to file a petition for rehearing out of time was granted, apparently on grounds of excusable neglect, and the petition was simultaneously denied; and Land v. Dollar, \n341 \nU.S. 737, 738\n, in which a belated \"motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration\" of a denial of certiorari was continued on the docket. The motion was ultimately withdrawn. \n344 \nU.S. 807\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Clark involved questions under the Trading with the Enemy Act, an untimely petition for rehearing of the denial of certiorari being granted because of a subsequently arising conflict. Unlike the present \n\n[353 \nU.S. 98, 106]\n\u00a0\n case, there was no other pending case through which the question could be settled by this Court for the future, because the \"conflict\" case was never appealed. See McGrath v. E. J. Lavino & Co., 91 F. Supp. 786, 787. More recently the Court has consistently denied belated petitions for rehearing based upon claimed subsequent conflicts. See the cases cited at pp. 108-109, infra, and particularly Mondakota Gas Co. v. Montana-Dakota Utilities Company, \n349 \nU.S. 969\n, where the Court denied leave to file an untimely petition for rehearing even though the decision below had been expressly disapproved by an intervening and controlling decision of this Court. See Parissi v. Telechron, Inc., \n349 \nU.S. 46, 47\n.\n\nThe Clark case is not a persuasive precedent on any of the legal questions involved in this case, because for all that appears neither side called the attention of the Court to the then recent enactment of 452 and its possible restrictive effects on prior rules relating to rehearings.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Cf.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nArticle IV of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 provided a plan under which men inducted into the armed forces would continue to receive the protection of previously purchased commercial life insurance while in the service without paying premiums.\n1\n Insurance companies were required to keep the policies of servicemen who elected to come under the Act in effect until one year after their military service ended even though these men made no further payments. The Government assured the insurance companies that the premiums would eventually be paid by giving its promissory certificates to the companies. The respondents, Plesha, Mabbutt, and Kern, who entered the Army in 1941, had previously purchased commercial life insurance. They invoked the benefits of the Act by filing proper applications with their companies and the Veterans' Administration. They made no further payment of premiums but the policies were kept in effect by government certificates. After leaving the Army, they were notified by the Veterans' Administration that unless they paid back premiums with interest their policies would lapse. Respondents allowed the policies to lapse and the Government paid the insuring companies the back premiums after first deducting the cash surrender value of the policies. In this case, the Government contends that it has a legal right to be reimbursed for these payments.\n2\n The District Court agreed with this contention. 123 F. Supp. 593. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding \n\n[352 \nU.S. 202, 204]\n\u00a0\n servicemen had no statutory or contractual obligation to the Government to repay the premiums. 227 F.2d 624.\n3\n We affirm the judgment below because the language of the 1940 Act, its legislative history and its administrative interpretation demonstrate that Congress intended that ex-soldiers would not have to reimburse the Government.\n\n1. The Act. - As the Government concedes, the 1940 Act contained no express provision which required reimbursement for premiums paid by the Government on a lapsed policy.\n4\n But significantly it did contain specific provisions to reduce any losses the Government might incur in administering the insurance plan by giving the Government certain other rights. Under 408 the United States had a lien upon the policy from the time it came under the protection of the Act. When a soldier died the insurance company was authorized by 409 to deduct unpaid premiums from the proceeds payable under the policy. If after leaving the service the insured desired to maintain his policy, 410 required him to pay the unpaid premiums to the insurance company. If he chose not to pay these premiums, 410 further provided \n\n[352 \nU.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n that the policy would lapse. And if a policy lapsed, 411 provided that the United States should be given credit for the policy's cash surrender value as an offset against the Government's promise to pay the back premiums. There was nothing that indicated that an ex-soldier had to reimburse the Government for any balance that it paid.\n\n2. The legislative history. - The Government's claim for reimbursement is refuted by the legislative history. Article IV of the 1940 Act substantially reenacted the insurance provisions of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1918\n5\n and had little independent legislative history. We agree with the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs that this scant history \"is of little, if any, help\" in interpreting the 1940 Act.\n6\n We must therefore examine the history of the 1918 bill.\n7\n During the Senate Committee hearings on this bill, Senator Reed, who was the principal critic of its insurance provisions, interpreted them as permitting a soldier to let his policy lapse without any obligation to restore the premiums paid by the Government.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 202, 206]\n\u00a0\n He objected to the Government's bearing any part of the cost and even suggested that the bill should be amended to authorize the Government to deduct the premiums from the soldier's monthly pay. Professor John H. Wigmore, who as a major representing the Army had a dominant part in drafting the bill and presenting it to Congress, strongly objected to Senator Reed's suggestions. Professor Wigmore pointed out that this benefit would be in keeping with the many new benefits which were being conferred on servicemen at that critical war period. When directly asked whether a soldier could be made to pay, he called attention to the fact that the Government had a lien on the policy and could recover the cash surrender value. He admitted, however, that the cash surrender value would not in all cases pay the entire amount of back premiums but predicted that the loss to the Government would be very slight.\n9\n The \n\n[352 \nU.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n Committee accepted Professor Wigmore's position and reported the bill in the form he urged.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee made a comprehensive report on the 1918 bill.\n10\n It referred to the insurance sections as providing a method for the Government to \"carry\" the premiums upon servicemen's policies in private companies. The Committee recognized that carrying this insurance would cost the Government money, but expressed the hope that this burden would not be large because:\n\n \"In the first place the Government only guarantees the payment of the premiums. If the soldier dies the insurance company will get its premiums out of the policy and the Government's guaranty will not be called upon. If the soldier comes back from the war he will repay the premiums if he continues the policy, and if he lets the policy lapse the Government will be subrogated to his rights.\"\n11\n\u00a0\n\n\n Thus, the Committee apparently thought that the Government must look to the cash surrender value to mitigate its loss where a policy was allowed to lapse.\n\nIn 1942, the 1940 Act was amended to require ex-servicemen to reimburse the Government for back premiums paid by it on their lapsed policies.\n12\n The Government \n\n[352 \nU.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n contends that this 1942 Amendment was to clarify and reaffirm the meaning of the 1940 Act. However it appears that the Veterans' Administration requested the 1942 Amendment to \". . . eliminate the possibility of requiring the Government to pay premiums on insurance which the insured does not intend to carry except during his period of active service . . . .\"\n13\n And during a hearing before the House Committee on Military Affairs a Veterans' Administration representative testified, \"[t]he insured is liable for all of the premiums of the $5,000 policy, the Government acting really as a guarantor. However, if there is a default [by the ex-serviceman], there would not be any liability for the whole amount, in excess of the cash [surrender] value under present construction of existing law.\"\n14\n If the legislative history of the 1942 Act indicates anything, it is that Congress thought that it was changing the law by changing the language of the Act.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n3. The administrative interpretation. - The administration of the 1918 and 1940 Acts does not support the Government's claim for reimbursement. The Government \n\n[352 \nU.S. 202, 209]\n\u00a0\n relies on the fact that a few soldiers who invoked the protection of the 1918 Act and allowed their policies to lapse were later required to reimburse it. However these collections were so sporadic and so insignificant that instead of supporting the Government's position they contradict it.\n16\n Under the 1940 Act, 401 (2) required the Veterans' Administration to issue notices explaining the Act. None of the notices promulgated prior to 1943 suggested any duty on the part of servicemen to reimburse the Government.\n17\n But public statements of Veterans' Administration officials gave the Act a squarely contrary construction.\n18\n\u00a0\n\n[352 \nU.S. 202, 210]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 401 (1) required soldiers seeking the benefit of the 1940 Act to file applications on forms prepared in accordance with the regulations of the Veterans' Administration. The respondents here filed such an application which included within its terms the following agreement:\n\n\"In consideration hereof, I hereby consent and agree that the United States shall be protected in the amount of any premiums and interest guaranteed on the above numbered policy in the event of its maturity as a claim, or out of the cash surrender value of the policy, at the expiration of the period of protection under the Act.\"\n\n\n This contract, prepared by the Veterans' Administration, contained no suggestion to soldiers that they would be expected to reimburse the Government for its payment of premiums if they permitted their policies to lapse. Had the Veterans' Administration construed the Act as imposing such a liability on soldiers, we think it would have mentioned the obligation in the contract that it asked them to sign.\n\nCongress passed the 1918 and 1940 Acts at a time when men were being called from civilian life into the Army in the face of impending war. Great efforts were made to ease the burden on these men and their dependents. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 202, 211]\n\u00a0\n Among these, the Government generously provided family allotments, disability payments, and low-cost government insurance. Similarly the provisions under consideration here were adopted to assist soldiers who had bought insurance before entering the Army and did not require them to reimburse the Government.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN dissent for the reasons given by Circuit Judge Huxman in United States v. Hendler, 225 F.2d 106.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 54 Stat. 1183, 50 U.S.C. App. (1940 ed.) 540.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Plesha brought suit against the Government to recover a dividend declared on his National Service Life Insurance policy. The Government attempted to offset the amount it had paid on his commercial insurance. The other respondents intervened to litigate the same basic issue.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] We granted certiorari, \n350 \nU.S. 1013\n, because this holding was in conflict with United States v. Hendler, 225 F.2d 106.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Government contends that such an obligation should be implied from the Act and from general principles of the common law - particularly the doctrine that a guarantor who pays the debt of another is entitled to reimbursement. In regard to the common-law right of a guarantor, we are not persuaded from the record that the insured servicemen were indebted to the insurance companies for the wartime premiums either under the Act or the terms of their policies. Where no debt exists there is no basis for applying the common-law rules of guaranty. In any event, we would be very hesitant to infer a right to reimbursement from these servicemen in favor of the Government based on a common-law doctrine which was not referred to in the Act or in its congressional history. Cf. United States v. Gilman, \n347 \nU.S. 507\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 40 Stat. 444. \"The only change in this article [insurance] relates to method of administration.\" H. R. Rep.

The Government relies here on a discussion between Congressmen Voorhis and Arends during the House debates on the 1940 Act. 86 Cong. Rec., Part 12, 13132-13133. Apparently these gentlemen were not familiar with the specific provisions of the Act. This is not surprising since neither was a sponsor of the measure. Moreover, since the 1940 Act was a substantial reenactment of the 1918 Act, there were no committee hearings to inform congressmen of the precise scope and effect of the Act. As neither Mr. Voorhis nor Mr. Arends were lawyers, it cannot be assumed that they were aware of the technical common-law theory of guaranty which the Government relies on here. We think the Veterans' Administrator was correct in concluding that the legislative history, which includes the Voorhis-Arends colloquy, \"is of little, if any, help\" to the Government's claim.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Boone v. Lightner, \n319 \nU.S. 561, 565\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] \"If he comes back and wants to keep his insurance in effect, I take it the proposition here is that he must then pay the Government; but if he does not want to keep this policy in effect he still has the option to walk away and leave it.\" Hearings before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on S. 2859 and H. R. 6361, 65th Cong., 1st and 2d Sess. 135.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In closing the argument over requiring the soldiers to pay, the following colloquy took place between Major Wigmore and Senator Reed:\n\n\"Senator Reed: . . . Now, do you think that would be undesirable, Major, or do you think it would be greatly to be preferred that the Government just carry the risk?\n\n\n\"Maj. Wigmore: I can only speak for myself in that respect; but, speaking from my own judgment, it would seem to me that that is going further than this Nation ought to wish to go against its soldiers and sailors. . . .\n\n\n\"Senator Reed: . . . You really think it is desirable that the Government should carry it, regardless of the attempt to reimburse itself out of the man's pay?\n\n\n\"Maj. Wigmore: I only want to point out the fact that the Government, in the war-risk insurance bill . . . has offered to give Government insurance to soldiers and sailors at a rate of, I think, $8 a \n\n[352 \nU.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n thousand, which I am told means that the Government pays the entire expenses of administration of that insurance. . . .

The total amount of back premiums paid by the Government on these policies was less than $20,000 or approximately $42 per policy, showing that Major Wigmore's prophecy as to the smallness of the Government's losses was a correct one. The Government sought reimbursement on only 10 of these 476 lapsed policies and total collections were $484.42. Records submitted show that all collections were obtained from soldiers who were still in the Army at the time they were called on to pay. The demands for payment went through regular military channels.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Apparently the first time the Veterans' Administration ever officially interpreted the Act as authorizing the Government to be reimbursed for its payment of premiums on lapsed policies was in Administrator's Decision No. 513, March 1, 1943. This decision held that the Government's agreement to carry policies under the 1940 Act was a \"gratuitous assumption of liability\" which had been retroactively changed by the 1942 Amendment. Decisions of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, No. 513 (March 1943), Vol. 1, 781. However we agree with the view expressed in a later Administrator's Decision, No. 742, that a serviceman's liability under the 1940 Act must be determined under it and not under the 1942 Act. And see Lynch v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 571\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Less than two months after the 1940 Act was passed, the Director of Insurance for the Veterans' Administration replying to a telegraphic inquiry stated that \"No provision is made in the Act for \n\n[352 \nU.S. 202, 210]\n\u00a0\n collecting from insured the amount paid by Government to insurer.\" Shortly afterwards the Director made a similar statement to an insurance company representative.\n\nIn the meantime the Assistant Director made the following statement for publication in an insurance journal: \"There is no provision in the Act at this time for collecting from the insured the amount that the premium with interest may exceed the cash surrender value at the time of termination.\" This same interpretation was given by the Assistant Director when testifying before the House Committee on Military Affairs in favor of the 1942 Amendment.

CO.(1957)\nNo. 1\nArgued: October 17, 1957Decided: December 16, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In a jury trial in a federal court, respondents were convicted of willfully attempting to evade federal corporate income taxes. The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that their privilege against self-incrimination had been violated by the admission of evidence obtained as a result of timely voluntary disclosures made by them in good faith in the hope of obtaining immunity from criminal prosecution under a policy then followed by the Treasury Department. After petitioning this Court for certiorari, the Government moved that the case be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings, on the ground that newly discovered evidence revealed that testimony at the trial concerning the timeliness and good faith of respondents' disclosures was perjured and fraudulent. Held: This Court will not review a case on the basis of a record so challenged as being tainted with perjury and fraud; the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated; and the case is remanded to the District Court for re-examination in further proceedings on the issues relating to respondents' allegedly voluntary disclosures. Pp. 234-246.\n\n (a) This Court will not review a case when the record is challenged, on the basis of newly discovered evidence, as being so tainted with perjury and fraud. Communist Party v.

Pp. 241-242.\n\n\n (b) Here a convincing showing has been made that newly discovered evidence will show that testimony concerning crucial questions as to the timeliness and good faith of respondents' disclosures was perjured and fraudulent; and this Court will not review the decision of the Court of Appeals until these charges have been resolved.

On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice, Leonard B. Sand and Joseph M. Howard.\n\nGeorge B. Christensen argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were Howard Ellis and William T. Kirby.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents an unusual question involving the integrity of a criminal trial in the federal courts.\n\nThe Solicitor General has filed a motion in this Court to remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings. This motion is based on a proffer of evidence \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 235]\n\u00a0\n alleged to have come into the possession of the Government after the United States had petitioned for certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals setting aside the conviction of the respondents. It is claimed that such evidence shows that the decision of the Court of Appeals was based upon a perjurious record attributable to the fraud of the respondents.\n\nA clear appreciation of both the proceedings in the lower courts and the peculiar circumstances in which the Government's motion arises is essential to an understanding of why we believe the motion to remand must be granted.\n\nIn 1953 the respondents and Frank J. Huebner, after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, were convicted of willfully attempting to evade the 1945 and 1946 federal corporate income taxes of the Shotwell Manufacturing Company.\n1\n Prior to trial they moved for dismissal of the indictment on the ground that their voluntary and timely disclosure of these tax derelictions to the taxing authorities entitled them to immunity from prosecution under the Treasury's former \"voluntary disclosure policy.\"\n2\n This motion was denied by the District Court after a pretrial hearing. Respondents and Huebner then moved, on the same \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n ground, for suppression of the evidence obtained from them by the taxing authorities as a result of their alleged disclosure. After a further pretrial hearing, the District Court also denied this motion, later filing an opinion in which it found that the disclosure was not made in good faith.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed as to the dismissal motion but reversed as to the suppression motion, set aside the convictions, and remanded the case for a new trial. 225 F.2d 394.\n4\n The Court of Appeals found that the respondents' disclosure was bona fide, and also ruled that the disclosure was timely, an issue which the District Court had not reached.\n5\n The Government petitioned us for certiorari on the suppression issue and the respondents and Huebner cross-petitioned on the dismissal issue.\n6\n Thereafter, the Government filed its motion to remand, on which, as later amended and supplemented, respondents \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n and Huebner joined issue by the filing of answers.\n7\n Considering that the matters presented by the motion to remand raised an important issue affecting the proper administration of justice in the federal courts, we granted the Government's petition for certiorari, \"limited to the issues raised in the amended motion to remand and supplement thereto and the respondents' answer to the amended motion to remand.\"\n8\n\u00a0\n352 \nU.S. 997\n. We denied the cross-petition for certiorari. \n352 \nU.S. 998\n.\n\nFor an understanding of the significance of the newly discovered evidence\n9\n proffered by the Government some knowledge is required of the position taken by the defendants in the District Court on the suppression issue. The substance of that position was presented by Leon J. Busby, Shotwell's accountant, who testified at both the hearing on the motion to suppress and at the trial. He stated that the Shotwell Company in each of the years 1945 and 1946 had received substantial cash payments for black-market candy sales above O. P. A. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 238]\n\u00a0\n ceiling prices;\n10\n that these receipts were not recorded on Shotwell's books and were not reported in its income tax returns; that he first learned of these facts in the course of conversations with H. Stanley Graflund, Shotwell's comptroller, during a trip they took to New York early in January 1948; that immediately upon his return to Chicago he discussed the matter with respondents Cain and Sullivan; that he recommended disclosing the omissions to the taxing authorities; and that, at the direction of respondents, he revealed the entire affair to Ernest J. Sauber, Deputy Collector in Chicago, in a series of conferences beginning in the latter part of January 1948, at one or more of which conferences he was accompanied by Cain. He also testified that thereafter, acting under Sauber's instructions and assurances that only a civil liability was involved, he and his staff, with the assistance of Cain, Huebner and Graflund, conducted an exhaustive investigation over a period of several months to reconstruct the Shotwell figures on the black-market transactions. He said that these figures were furnished in August 1948 to a revenue agent for scrutiny.\n\nSauber and Cain gave similar testimony, except that Sauber fixed Busby's first visit to him at about the middle of March 1948. Cain's explanation of Shotwell's failure to report the black-market receipts in its income tax returns was that he believed such receipts were not taxable since they were used by Shotwell to purchase black-market supplies\n11\n and therefore gave rise to no profit.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 239]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn support of its motion the Government has filed with the Court the affidavits of Huebner and Graflund, which they executed after the Government filed its petition for certiorari. These affidavits paint a sharply different picture of the entire affair; indeed, they flatly contradict the tale unfolded on behalf of the respondents in the District Court. More specifically: (1) Graflund swears that the first time he discussed the black-market transactions with Busby was at Busby's home in late June 1948, at which time Busby gave no indication that he had previously known of these transactions;\n13\n (2) Graflund and Huebner swear that at no time prior to a meeting held in July 1948 were they ever advised or led to believe by respondents that Shotwell's black-market receipts had been disclosed to the Treasury; (3) Huebner swears that it was at this July 1948 meeting that Cain first told him that a voluntary disclosure would be made, and that Cain also gave him to understand that it had been \"agreed\" that the date of the disclosure \"would be set at June 15, 1948\";\n14\n (4) Graflund and Huebner swear that prior to the middle of July 1948 no work was done by anyone to assemble records or data for the purpose of making a disclosure to \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 240]\n\u00a0\n the tax authorities, and that the alleged offsetting payments for black-market supplies were in fact concocted \"out of thin air\" at the July meeting; and (5) Huebner swears that in July and August 1948 he gave Cain $10,000 which Cain said he needed \"to fix the tax difficulty we were in.\"\n15\n Huebner says in his affidavit that he was not asked to testify in the District Court \"because I had stated I would not lie on the stand.\"\n\nIt is obvious that the Government's new evidence casts the darkest shadow upon the truthfulness of the disclosure testimony given by or on behalf of the respondents in the District Court. If true, it indicates that what the respondents have sought to represent in the District Court, the Court of Appeals, and in this Court as a voluntary disclosure, made in a timely manner and in good faith, was instead but a further step in a conspiracy to \"fix\" Shotwell's tax difficulties, possibly involving the corruption \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 241]\n\u00a0\n of government officials,\n16\n and certainly entailing an attempt to perpetrate a fraud upon the courts. Were we to undertake to review the Court of Appeals upon a record as suspect as this, we might very well be lending ourselves to the consummation of a fraud which may already have made the Court of Appeals its unwitting victim. In these circumstances it is imperative that the case be remanded to the District Court for a full exploration of where the truth lies before the case is allowed to proceed further. The integrity of the judicial process demands no less.\n\nThe path to our decision is clearly marked by this Court's actions and pronouncements in two recent cases, Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, \n351 \nU.S. 115\n, and Mesarosh v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 1\n. In each case the Court refused to consider the questions presented for review in the face of a challenge to the integrity of the record based on newly discovered evidence. In Communist Party the Court remanded the case to the Board with directions to resolve the charges of taint, and to make a fresh determination on the merits, if taint were found.\n17\n In Mesarosh the Court, believing that the record clearly demonstrated that a key government witness had been wholly discredited, took more drastic action by reversing the convictions of the petitioners and remanding the case to the District Court for a new trial. The basic reason for the Court's action in \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 242]\n\u00a0\n both cases was made manifest in its opinions. In Communist Party, supra, at pp. 124-125, the Court said:\n\n\"The untainted administration of justice is certainly one of the most cherished aspects of our institutions. Its observance is one of our proudest boasts. This Court is charged with supervisory functions in relation to proceedings in the federal courts. See McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n. Therefore, fastidious regard for the honor of the administration of justice requires the Court to make certain that the doing of justice be made so manifest that only irrational or perverse claims of its disregard can be asserted. . . . We cannot pass upon a record containing such challenged testimony. We find it necessary to dispose of the case on the grounds we do, not in order to avoid a constitutional adjudication but because the fair administration of justice requires it.\"\n\n\n In Mesarosh, supra, at p. 14, the Court said:\n\n\"This is a federal criminal case, and this Court has supervisory jurisdiction over the proceedings of the federal courts. [Citing McNabb, supra, in a footnote.] If it has any duty to perform in this regard, it is to see that the waters of justice are not polluted. Pollution having taken place here, the condition should be remedied at the earliest opportunity.\"\n\n\n A convincing showing is of course necessary to bring these principles into play. We think that such a showing has been made here. The newly discovered evidence contained in the affidavits from the prospective witnesses Graflund and Huebner cuts to the very heart of the testimony adduced by respondents to show that they made a timely and bona fide disclosure to the Treasury, the sole issue involved in the suppression hearings and the issue on which the outcome of the case in the Court of Appeals turned. It is plain that either the testimony in the District \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 243]\n\u00a0\n Court was untrue or these affidavits themselves are the product of fraud. This is a matter for the District Court to determine. One thing is clear. This Court cannot be asked to review the decision of the Court of Appeals until these charges have been resolved.\n\nIn both the Communist Party and Mesarosh cases, supra, the action of the Court enured to the benefit of the defendants. In this instance the further proceedings below may work to the advantage of the Government.\n18\n In the circumstances of this case we think that the distinction makes no difference. Because they were found guilty by the jury, respondents concede, as they must, that the motion to remand involves no question of double jeopardy. See United States v. Ball, \n163 \nU.S. 662, 672\n. Their objection that it is \"unfair\" to allow the Government at this stage of the proceedings to \"bolster\" the record relating to the suppression issue is likewise unacceptable. It is undeniable, of course, that upon appellate reversal of a conviction the Government is not limited at a new trial to the evidence presented at the first trial, but is free to strengthen its case in any way it can by the introduction of new evidence. We think that in the peculiar circumstances of this case the fair administration of justice requires that the Government should have a similar opportunity here. For if the Government's evidence is found to be true, it would then appear that the Court of Appeals' decision setting aside the verdict was obtained by the respondents on a corrupt record attributable to their own fraud. In the further proceedings in the District Court the respondents will of course have a reciprocal opportunity to sustain the validity of their asserted voluntary disclosures. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 244]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe should not lose sight of the fact that the Government's new showing does not relate to an issue submitted to the jury in the proceedings below, but rather to a preliminary question as to the admissibility of evidence.\n19\n Hence, to grant the Government's motion is not to permit it to \"bolster\" the evidence upon which the verdict of guilty was returned by the jury in this case. That verdict clearly must stand or fall on the sufficiency of the evidence already introduced at the trial.\n\nIn these circumstances, acceptance of the respondents' position on this motion would be tantamount to sanctioning a rule which would prohibit appellate review upon a record suspect of taint, if the taint might operate to the disadvantage of the defendants, but which would nevertheless require review if the taint might operate to their advantage. We cannot subscribe to that quixotic result. The fair administration of justice is not such a one-way street.\n\nThe respondents contend that the motion to remand should originally have been addressed to the Court of Appeals, and that we should now send the Government back to that court.\n20\n This contention is essentially one \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 245]\n\u00a0\n addressed to our discretion, and in the circumstances of this case we find it unavailing. The Government was not in a position to make the motion until after its petition for certiorari had been filed in this Court. The course of this litigation has already been protracted. We are abundantly satisfied that the charges as to the integrity of the record must be fully aired, and that the proper forum for this is the District Court because of its intimate familiarity with the record and its facilities for sifting controverted facts. In this state of affairs we think that it would be both unnecessary and wasteful to remit the Government to the Court of Appeals. Cf. Mesarosh, supra, at p. 13.\n\nWe conclude with a word about the nature of the further proceedings in the District Court. The additional evidence to be presented by both sides will be confined to the suppression issue. The District Court will make such new findings of fact on this issue as may be appropriate in light of the further evidence and the entire existing record (see Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 162\n), including findings on the question of the timeliness of respondents' alleged disclosures.\n21\n If the District Court decides, on the basis of its new findings, to \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 246]\n\u00a0\n adhere to its original decision on the motion to suppress, it will then enter new final judgments based upon the record as supplemented by its new findings, thereby preserving to all parties the right to seek further appellate review, including respondents' right to have reviewed by the Court of Appeals alleged errors in the original trial which that court did not reach in the previous appeal. If, on the other hand, the District Court concludes after the further proceedings that the motion to suppress should have been granted, it would then become its duty to accord the respondents a new trial.\n\nIn accordance with the views set forth in this opinion, we make the following disposition of this case: (1) this Court's order of February 25, 1957, which granted with limitations the Government's petition for certiorari, is vacated and such petition is granted without restriction; (2) the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated; and (3) the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 145 (b), 53 Stat. 63. The Shotwell Company manufactured candy and marshmallows. Cain was President, Sullivan, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and Huebner, Vice President. Huebner is no longer a respondent here. See notes 6 and 7, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Under that policy, first announced by the Treasury Department in 1945, the Department did not refer to the Department of Justice for prosecution cases of intentional income tax evasion where the taxpayers had made a clean breast of things to the Treasury before any investigation had been initiated by the Revenue Service. This policy was set forth in various informal announcements by Treasury officials, but was never formalized by statute or regulation. The policy was abandoned in January 1952.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The propriety of this pretrial procedure is not before us.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Court of Appeals did not pass on other contentions made by the respondents in support of a reversal of their conviction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] More specifically, the Court of Appeals held that there was an effective voluntary disclosure and that the Government's use of the evidence thereby obtained from the respondents violated their rights under the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court simply held that the alleged voluntary disclosure was defective, and did not discuss the Fifth Amendment. In the present posture of this case we do not reach the correctness of these rulings of the two lower courts, or any other question going to the merits of the respondents' conviction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] We deferred consideration of the petition and cross-petitions for certiorari for some months on the basis of representations made by the Solicitor General in his letters of December 6, 1955, and June 1, 1956, which culminated in the filing of the Government's motion to remand. See \n351 \nU.S. 980\n. As originally filed, the cross-petition was conditional on the Government's petition being granted. After the Government moved to remand, respondents withdrew the conditional limitation, and Huebner withdrew his cross-petition in its entirety.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Huebner later withdrew his answer and consented to the Government's motion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Respondents point out that this limitation of our writ in effect amounted to a denial of the Government's petition for certiorari, and therefore that the motion to remand, which was not before the Court of Appeals, must be regarded as an attempt to invoke an original jurisdiction which we do not possess. We shall dispose of respondents' point by vacating our limited writ and granting, nunc pro tunc, the Government's petition for certiorari, without restriction. This removes all question as to our jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. 2106; Mesarosh v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 1\n, and prejudices neither party because we shall decide only the issues raised by the motion to remand.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Respondents have made no such showing in opposition to the Government's motion as would justify our questioning the accuracy of the Solicitor General's representation that the Government's proffered evidence is \"newly discovered.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Government puts the figure at some $380,000; the respondents' figure is about $160,000.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Except for the amount of $6,000 which was reported in the Shotwell returns.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Although the Treasury policy at the time denied deductibility to such black-market expenditures, the courts later held that this kind of expenditure was deductible. See Sullenger v. Commissioner, 11 T. C. 1076.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] According to Graflund's affidavit, it would appear that the respondents were spurred into action after Sam Krane, a Special Agent of the Internal Revenue Service, visited the Shotwell office on June 21, 1948. The affidavit states that Krane requested records and information relating to Shotwell's transactions with one David G. Lubben, from whom Shotwell had been receiving large sums of money which were not recorded in its regular books; that Graflund made certain records available to Krane and was \"criticized\" by the respondents for having done so; and that Graflund conferred with Busby within a few days after Krane's visit.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] In his affidavit Huebner states: \"On November 13, 1952, Sauber testified at the hearing on the defendant's motion to suppress evidence that Busby and Cain had contacted him in March, 1948. After hearing Sauber testify, I told Cain I thought the voluntary disclosure date was supposed to be June 15, 1948. Cain said to me, `Ssshhh! There is nobody that knows anything about this. Keep quiet.'\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The Solicitor General represents that if the motion to remand is granted Revenue Agent Joseph M. Lima will testify that on July 30, 1948 he was instructed by his Group Supervisor, Ralph Johnson, to make an immediate audit of Shotwell's 1946 return; that thereafter he was instructed by Johnson to allow (as offsets) over-ceiling purchases totaling more than $300,000, which were wholly unsubstantiated and whose allowance was contrary to the existing Revenue Service policy; and that he then prepared a report showing a tax deficiency for 1945 and 1946 of about $20,000, which report he destroyed at Johnson's direction in September 1948, after the Intelligence Unit of the Service had made inquiries about the case. In this connection Huebner states in his affidavit:\n\n\"Cain also told me, sometime in about late July, 1948, that he was about to settle the tax case. Shortly thereafter, Cain told me he had settled the tax case for a tax deficiency of $20,000.00.\n\n\n\"In October, 1948, Busby told me that there had been a meeting in the fraud division at the Internal Revenue office and that hell had broken loose; that some Internal Revenue people had a heck of a time destroying papers that had been made up for the purpose of billing Shotwell for taxes.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] See note 15, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Section 14 (a) of the Subversive Activities Control Act expressly authorizes courts of appeals to remand cases to the Board for the taking of further evidence. 64 Stat. 987, at 1001-1002. Our authority to act in similar fashion is found in the broad provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2106, which grants us power, incident to our appellate jurisdiction, to \"vacate . . . any judgment\" brought \"before [us] for review\" and to \"require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The Government does not concede the correctness of the Court of Appeals' decision upon the existing record. Cf. United States v. Johnson, \n327 \nU.S. 106, 111\n, 112.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Respondents did not urge below, nor do they suggest here, that the question of admissibility of the disputed evidence was properly an issue for the jury. Rather their contention has been that the judge should have sustained the motion to suppress.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] It has also been suggested that these charges of fraud could be dealt with at the new trial which the Court of Appeals has ordered. But as the Court of Appeals has directed suppression of the evidence obtained by the Government as a result of the alleged voluntary disclosure, it seems clear that at the new trial the Government could not use that evidence, or the fruits thereof, unless the \"suppression\" aspect of the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated. We think that the sound administration of justice precludes that course because, if the Government's evidence is true, the net effect would be to grant the respondents a new trial, not otherwise justified, procured by their own fraud.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Respondents have contended that the Government's new evidence is irrelevant to the issue of timeliness because, even assuming its truth, the disclosure was timely since no formal investigation was initiated by the Revenue Service until after July 1948, the time that the Government's new evidence indicates that the respondents first communicated with the Treasury. We find it unnecessary to deal with this contention because the new evidence is in any event clearly relevant to the question whether a bona fide disclosure was in fact ever made. Moreover, in the present state of the record this Court should not pass on respondents' argument as to timeliness because (a) the District Court has not yet made a finding on this issue, and (b) the Treasury \"voluntary disclosure policy\" was never formulated with sufficient precision to enable us to apply it mechanically.\n\nDissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur, announced by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n\nBy remanding this case so that the Government can introduce additional evidence to save the conviction thrown out by the Court of Appeals, I think the Court takes unnecessary and unprecedented action which may have far-reaching and unfortunate ramifications not yet clearly foreseen. I would deny certiorari and thus permit the case in its regular course to go back to the District Court for a new trial pursuant to the decision of the Court of Appeals. At this trial the Government could introduce any evidence which it now has, new or otherwise, and a full hearing could be had on its charges of perjury and fraud. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 247]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that defendants' incriminating disclosures were secured by promises of immunity made by various government officials and that such disclosures could not be used to convict defendants because of their privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. Now this Court sends the case back to the District Court to hear new evidence and make new findings with respect to whether defendants' disclosures were made in good faith and in full accordance with certain vague conditions attached to the offers of immunity.\n1\n The majority asserts that it is not ruling on the merits of the defendants' Fifth Amendment claims but it seems to me a vain and wasteful act for the majority to return the case to the District Court for these supplemental proceedings unless it assumes that neither the Fifth Amendment nor any rule of evidence in the federal courts bars the use of incriminating admissions induced by promises of immunity where the disclosures are not made with pure motives. If we are going to concern ourselves with the case at all, I believe we should at least give full consideration to the legal problems involved in defendants' requests for suppression before remanding the case for any further proceedings.\n\nI think the Fifth Amendment questions raised here are important, unsettled and not susceptible to offhand resolution, particularly with respect to incriminating evidence which the defendants actually turned over to the Government in hope of securing immunity from prosecution. In Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532, 542\n-543, the Court referred with approval to the rule that\n\n\"`. . . a confession, in order to be admissible, must be free and voluntary: that is, must not be extracted \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 248]\n\u00a0\n by any sort of threats or violence, nor obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight, nor by the exertion of any improper influence. . . . A confession can never be received in evidence where the prisoner has been influenced by any threat or promise; for the law cannot measure the force of the influence used, or decide upon its effect upon the mind of the prisoner, and therefore excludes the declaration if any degree of influence has been exerted.'\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n In accord with this statement it appears to have been generally assumed in this Court that the Fifth Amendment bars the use against a defendant in a criminal prosecution of confessions or admissions secured from him by promises of immunity. See, e. g., Hardy v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 224, 229\n; Ziang Sung Wan v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 1, 14\n; Smith v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 147, 150\n. And so far as I can tell this Court has never considered whether lack of good faith deprives a suspect of the Fifth Amendment's protection when he makes disclosures under a promise of immunity, or under just what circumstances and to what extent this might be true. I do not mean to intimate any view on the merits of this problem now, but I do register a protest against the manner in which the majority disposes of the case.\n\nI believe the majority has also disregarded another significant and crucial consideration - the role of the jury in passing on the admissibility of defendants' disclosures. In Wilson v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 613, 624\n, the Court laid down a rule which it has never questioned:\n\n \"When there is a conflict of evidence as to whether a confession is or is not voluntary, if the court decides that it is admissible, the question may be left to the jury with the direction that they should reject the confession if upon the whole evidence they are satisfied it was not the voluntary act of the defendant.\" \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 249]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Just recently in Smith v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 147, 151\n, the Court stated that the question of voluntariness was properly left to the jury where a taxpayer claimed he had made certain disclosures on the strength of promises of immunity by revenue officers. Cf. Kent v. Porto Rico, \n207 \nU.S. 113, 118\n-119.\n\nIn the lower federal courts there seems to be considerable difference of opinion as to whether the Wilson case makes it mandatory that the jury participate in the process of determining whether a confession is voluntary or whether the jury's participation is a matter of discretion with the trial judge.\n2\n E. g., compare United States v. Leviton, 193 F.2d 848, 852, cert. denied, \n343 \nU.S. 946\n, with Lewis v. United States, 74 F.2d 173, 178-179. In at least the District of Columbia Circuit the rule appears to be settled that the trial judge must submit the question of voluntariness to the jury for its independent determination. McAffee v. United States, 70 App. D.C. 142, 105 F.2d 21. In the States a number of different methods of allocating the burden of determining the voluntariness of a confession between the judge and jury have been followed, but the trend seems to be that the judge should determine voluntariness in the first instance and if he finds that the confession is voluntary then should submit the case to the jury with instructions not to consider the confession as evidence unless they also find it voluntary. As a matter of fact the Court in Wilson relied on state cases which had laid down this so-called \"humane\" rule. I myself favor such a rule, which is particularly beneficial where, as here, the question of admissibility turns to a large extent on the credibility of witnesses.\n\nI think that the principles established in Wilson and subsequent cases clearly apply to the questions of admissibility \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 250]\n\u00a0\n raised in this case. Under these principles the trial judge, at a minimum, has the option of submitting such questions to the jury. But the majority's disposition of this case precludes that possibility at the partial new trial which it orders. It attempts to avoid this infirmity by saying, \"the Government's new showing does not relate to an issue submitted to the jury in the proceedings below, but rather to a preliminary question as to the admissibility of evidence.\" And it continues, \"Respondents did not urge below, nor do they suggest here, that the question of admissibility of the disputed evidence was properly an issue for the jury.\" But these answers are obviously inadequate. We are not concerned with what has happened or what was urged but with how this case will be handled in the future. If the new trial ordered by the Court of Appeals had been allowed to stand the defendants would not have been barred from demanding that the question of admissibility be submitted to the jury just because they had not made a similar request at the first trial or on appeal.\n\nThe Court now gives the Government an opportunity to introduce new evidence in an attempt to save a conviction it has lost in the Court of Appeals. If this does not technically infringe the protection against double jeopardy it seems to me to violate its spirit. Cf. Green v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 184\n; Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 128\n-129. In fact it is even worse in some respects. Only the Government stands to benefit from this partial new trial while the defendants must fight to keep what they already have. Not a single case has been referred to or discovered where defendants have been subjected to such piecemeal prosecution.\n3\n To my knowledge \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 251]\n\u00a0\n it is a new idea that the Government can supplement a trial record in order to retain a conviction which an appellate court would otherwise reverse.\n\nBoth the Government and the Court concede that the action taken here is extraordinary but such disposition is justified on the ground that this is an exceptional case which called for extraordinary action. I do not agree. In essence all the Government proposes to do on remand is to impeach the testimony of certain witnesses for both sides with alleged newly discovered evidence. No witness has recanted nor do the defendants concede that their testimony was false. If the Government can partially reopen a case to impeach witnesses what rational basis is there for denying it a similar right in any case when new facts appear which persuasively suggest that it could strengthen its evidence in order to save a conviction on appeal? This possibility emphasizes the anomalous nature of what is done here.\n\nThe Court proceeds on the assumption that it would be improper for us to review the suppression question on a record which might contain materially false testimony \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 252]\n\u00a0\n and that it is better, although concededly unique, to send the case back for more evidence on that issue. But there is no need to resort to either undesirable alternative. As I stated in the beginning the case should simply be left alone and allowed to go back for a new trial. There the Government can offer all the evidence it has or can secure so that a new record can be made on the suppression issue. In my judgment it cannot seriously be contended that the Government would be barred from introducing evidence on that issue at a new trial. While it is true that the Court of Appeals ordered the disclosures suppressed, on the evidence in the record then before it, such ruling should not be construed as binding at a new trial where substantial newly discovered evidence is available. Cf. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Wharton, 63 F.2d 378; City of Sedalia ex rel. Ferguson v. Shell Petroleum Corp., 81 F.2d 193. If need be - and I think not - this Court could vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals to the extent necessary to allow the Government a de novo hearing on the suppression issue at the new trial. 28 U.S.C. 2106. This would do full justice as far as the charges of tax evasion are concerned and if perjury has been committed it can be prosecuted as a separate crime.\n\nI think this case is a dangerous precedent which should not be launched needlessly into the stream of the law.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"We are not concerned with the motivating force behind an individual's deciding to come in and talk to us about his evasion. If he `gets religion' before we have done anything, he will not be prosecuted.\" Treasury Press Release, May 14, 1947.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The entire subject is annotated in great detail at 170 A. L. R. 567. Also see 85 A. L. R. 870.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Neither Mesarosh v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 1\n, nor Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., \n351 \nU.S. 115\n, serves as any authority for the Court's action. In the Mesarosh case the Government had secured a conviction which had been upheld by the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 251]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals. In this Court the Government came forward with evidence that one of its principal witnesses at the trial had committed perjury and the Court reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a full new trial. Here the United States has lost a conviction in the Court of Appeals. It now asks us to send the case back to the trial court so that it can introduce additional evidence in an attempt to salvage the reversed conviction. The difference between the two cases is manifest and crucial.\n\nIn the Communist Party case administrative findings were challenged and this Court remanded the case to the agency so that it might consider the record free of any perjurious testimony by government witnesses. The administrative proceeding there can hardly be equated with the criminal prosecution involved here. Moreover, in both the Mesarosh and Communist Party cases the Court's action operated to protect the rights of defendants, not as here to aid the Government. In view of our traditional methods of criminal justice this difference is not without importance. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 233, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney and Beatrice Rosenberg.\n\nFenton L. Martin argued the cause and filed a brief for appellee.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case concerns the meaning of the word \"stolen\" in the following provision of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act, commonly known as the Dyer Act:\n\n \"Whoever transports in interstate or foreign commerce a motor vehicle or aircraft, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n The issue before us is whether the meaning of the word \"stolen,\" as used in this provision, is limited to a taking which amounts to common-law larceny, or whether it includes an embezzlement or other felonious taking with intent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership. For the reasons hereafter stated, we accept the broader interpretation.\n\nIn 1956, an information based on this section was filed against James Vernon Turley in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. It charged that Turley, in South Carolina, lawfully obtained possession of an automobile from its owner for the purpose of driving certain of their friends to the homes of the latter in South Carolina, but that, without permission of the owner and with intent to steal the automobile, Turley \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 409]\n\u00a0\n converted it to his own use and unlawfully transported it in interstate commerce to Baltimore, Maryland, where he sold it without permission of the owner.\n2\n The information thus charged Turley with transporting the automobile in interstate commerce knowing it to have been obtained by embezzlement rather than by common-law larceny.\n\nCounsel appointed for Turley moved to dismiss the information on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute an offense against the United States. He contended that the word \"stolen\" as used in the Act referred only to takings which constitute common-law larceny and that the acts charged did not. The District Court agreed and dismissed the information. 141 F. Supp. 527. The United States concedes that the facts alleged in the information do not constitute common-law larceny, but disputes the holding that a motor vehicle obtained by embezzlement is not \"stolen\" within the meaning of the Act. The Government appealed directly \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 410]\n\u00a0\n to this Court under 18 U.S.C. 3731 because the dismissal was based upon a construction of the statute upon which the information was founded. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n352 \nU.S. 816\n.\n\nDecisions involving the meaning of \"stolen\" as used in the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act did not arise frequently until comparatively recently. Two of the earlier cases interpreted \"stolen\" as meaning statutory larceny as defined by the State in which the taking occurred.\n3\n The later decisions rejected that interpretation but divided on whether to give \"stolen\" a uniformly narrow meaning restricted to common-law larceny, or a uniformly broader meaning inclusive of embezzlement and other felonious takings with intent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership.\n4\n The Fifth, Eighth and Tenth Circuits favored the narrow definition,\n5\n while the Fourth, Sixth and Ninth Circuits favored \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 411]\n\u00a0\n the broader one.\n6\n We agree that in the absence of a plain indication of an intent to incorporate diverse state laws into a federal criminal statute, the meaning of the federal statute should not be dependent on state law. See Jerome v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 101, 104\n (1943); United States v. Handler, 142 F.2d 351, 354 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1944).\n\nWe recognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a common-law term of established meaning without otherwise defining it, the general practice is to give that term its common-law meaning.\n7\n But \"stolen\" (or \"stealing\") has no accepted common-law meaning. On this point the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently said:\n\n\"But while `stolen' is constantly identified with larceny, the term was never at common law equated or \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 412]\n\u00a0\n exclusively dedicated to larceny. `Steal' (originally `stale') at first denoted in general usage a taking through secrecy, as implied in `stealth,' or through stratagem, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Expanded through the years, it became the generic designation for dishonest acquisition, but it never lost its initial connotation. Nor in law is `steal' or `stolen' a word of art. Blackstone does not mention `steal' in defining larceny - `the felonious taking and carrying away of the personal goods of another' - or in expounding its several elements. IV Commentaries 229 et seq.\" Boone v. United States, 235 F.2d 939, 940 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1956).\n\n\n Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed., 1953) likewise defines \"stolen\" as \"Obtained or accomplished by theft, stealth, or craft . . . .\" Black's Law Dictionary (4th ed., 1951) states that \"steal\" \"may denote the criminal taking of personal property either by larceny, embezzlement, or false pretenses.\"\n8\n Furthermore, \"stolen\" and \"steal\" have been used in federal criminal statutes, and the courts interpreting those words have declared that they do not have a necessary common-law meaning coterminous with larceny and exclusive of other theft crimes.\n9\n Freed from a common-law meaning, we should \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 413]\n\u00a0\n give \"stolen\" the meaning consistent with the context in which it appears.\n\n \"That criminal statutes are to be construed strictly is a proposition which calls for the citation of no authority. But this does not mean that every criminal statute must be given the narrowest possible meaning in complete disregard of the purpose of the legislature.\" United States v. Bramblett, \n348 \nU.S. 503, 509\n-510 (1955); see also, United States v. Sullivan, \n332 \nU.S. 689, 693\n-694 (1948).\n\n\n It is, therefore, appropriate to consider the purpose of the Act and to gain what light we can from its legislative history.\n\nBy 1919, the law of most States against local theft had developed so as to include not only common-law larceny but embezzlement, false pretenses, larceny by trick, and other types of wrongful taking. The advent of the automobile, however, created a new problem with which the States found it difficult to deal. The automobile was uniquely suited to felonious taking whether by larceny, embezzlement or false pretenses. It was a valuable, salable article which itself supplied the means for speedy escape. \"The automobile [became] the perfect chattel for modern large-scale theft.\"\n10\n This challenge could be best \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 414]\n\u00a0\n met through use of the Federal Government's jurisdiction over interstate commerce. The need for federal action increased with the number, distribution and speed of the motor vehicles until, by 1919, it became a necessity.\n11\n The result was the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act.\n\nThis background was reflected in the Committee Report on the bill presented by its author and sponsor, Representative Dyer. H. R. Rep. No. 312, 66th Cong., 1st Sess. This report, entitled \"Theft of Automobiles,\" pointed to the increasing number of automobile thefts, the resulting financial losses, and the increasing cost of automobile theft insurance. It asserted that state laws were inadequate to cope with the problem because the offenders evaded state officers by transporting the automobiles across state lines where associates received and sold them. Throughout the legislative history Congress used the word \"stolen\" as synonymous with \"theft,\" a term generally considered to be broader than \"common-law larceny.\"\n12\n To be sure, the discussion referred to \"larceny\" but nothing was said about excluding other forms of \"theft.\" The report stated the object of the Act in broad terms, primarily emphasizing the need for the exercise of federal powers.\n13\n No mention is made of a purpose to \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 415]\n\u00a0\n distinguish between different forms of theft, as would be expected if the distinction had been intended.\n14\n\u00a0\n\n\"Larceny\" is also mentioned in Brooks v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 432\n (1925).\n15\n This reference, however, carries \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 416]\n\u00a0\n no necessary implication excluding the taking of automobiles by embezzlement or false pretenses. Public and private rights are violated to a comparable degree whatever label is attached to the felonious taking. A typical example of common-law larceny is the taking of an unattended automobile. But an automobile is no less \"stolen\" because it is rented, transported interstate, and sold without the permission of the owner (embezzlement).\n16\n The same is true where an automobile is purchased with a worthless check, transported interstate, and sold (false pretenses).\n17\n Professional thieves resort to innumerable forms of theft and Congress presumably \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 417]\n\u00a0\n sought to meet the need for federal action effectively rather than to leave loopholes for wholesale evasion.\n18\n\u00a0\n\n\n We conclude that the Act requires an interpretation of \"stolen\" which does not limit it to situations which at common law would be considered larceny. The refinements of that crime are not related to the primary congressional purpose of eliminating the interstate traffic in unlawfully obtained motor vehicles. The Government's interpretation is neither unclear nor vague. \"Stolen\" as used in 18 U.S.C. 2312 includes all felonious takings of motor vehicles with intent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership, regardless of whether or not the theft constitutes common-law larceny.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 18 U.S.C. 2312.

These amendments sought to clarify the application of the Act by adding the words \"embezzled, feloniously converted, or taken feloniously by fraud,\" or similar language. Such an amendment was adopted by one House of Congress in each of the 81st, 83d and 84th Congresses, but in each case it failed to come to a vote in the other House. Appellee seeks support for his interpretation of \"stolen\" in the failure of Congress to enact these proposals, but we think this failure is entitled to no significance. The proposed amendments are shown by their respective Committee Reports to be clarifying amendments. They included other proposed changes and were never voted down. See S. 1483, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nIf Congress desires to make cheating, in all its myriad varieties, a federal offense when employed to obtain an automobile that is then taken across a state line, it should express itself with less ambiguity than by language that leads three Courts of Appeals to decide that it has not said so and three that it has. If \"stealing\" (describing a thing as \"stolen\") be not a term of art, it must be deemed a colloquial, everyday term. As such, it would hardly be used, even loosely, by the man in the street to cover \"cheating.\" Legislative drafting is dependent on treacherous words to convey, as often as not, complicated ideas, and courts should not be pedantically exacting in construing \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 418]\n\u00a0\n legislation. But to sweep into the jurisdiction of the federal courts the transportation of cars obtained not only by theft but also by trickery does not present a problem so complicated that the Court should search for hints to find a command. When Congress has wanted to deal with many different ways of despoiling another of his property and not merely with larceny, it has found it easy enough to do so, as a number of federal enactments attest. See, e. g., 18 U.S.C. 641, 655, 659, 1707. No doubt, penal legislation should not be artificially restricted so as to allow escape for those for whom it was with fair intendment designed. But the principle of lenity which should guide construction of criminal statutes, Bell v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 81, 83\n-84, precludes extending the term \"stolen\" to include every form of dishonest acquisition. This conclusion is encouraged not only by the general consideration governing the construction of penal laws; it also has regard for not bringing to the federal courts a mass of minor offenses that are local in origin until Congress expresses, if not an explicit, at least an unequivocal, desire to do so.\n\nI would affirm the judgment. \n\n[352 \nU.S. 407, 419]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","161":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is an action brought in the District Court by the United States to enjoin the Union Pacific Railroad Company from drilling for oil and gas on \"the right of way\" granted it by 2 of the Act of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat. 489, 491, for the construction of a railroad and telegraph line. The claim of the United States is that \"the right of way\" granted by the Act is not a grant that includes mineral rights. The District Court's decision was adverse to the United States. 126 F. Supp. 646. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 230 F.2d 690. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted in view of the public importance of the question presented. \n352 \nU.S. 818\n.\n\nThe \"right of way\" which was granted by 2 of the Act was \"for the construction of said railroad and telegraph line.\" As an aid to the construction of the railroad, \"every alternate section of public land\" on each side of the road was also granted. 3. Section 3 further provided \"That \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n all mineral lands shall be excepted from the operation of this act . . . .\" (Italics added.)\n\nOn the face of the Act it would seem that the use of the words \"the right of way\" describes a lesser interest than the grant of \"public land.\" Moreover, this right of way was granted Union Pacific \"for the construction of said railroad and telegraph line.\" 2. That purpose is not fulfilled when the right of way is used for other purposes. See Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Townsend, \n190 \nU.S. 267, 271\n. It would seem that, whatever may be the nature of Union Pacific's interest in the right of way, drilling for oil on or under it is not a railroad purpose within the meaning of 2 of the Act.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nIt would also seem from the words of the Act that, whatever rights may have been included in \"the right of way,\" mineral rights were excepted by reason of the proviso in 3 excepting \"mineral lands.\" The exception of \"mineral lands,\" as applied to the right of way, may have been an inept way of reserving mineral rights. The right of way certainly could not be expected to take all the detours that might be necessary were it to avoid all lands containing minerals. But that the proviso applies to 2 as well as to 3 is plain. While the grant of \"the right of way\" is made by 2 and the exception of \"mineral lands\" is contained in 3, the exception extends not merely to 3 but to the entire Act. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is said that the exception in 3 was in terms made applicable to the entire Act merely to leave no doubt that land grants to other railroads, contained in 9, 13 and 14 of the Act, were not to include \"mineral lands.\" But the exception in 3 is not limited merely to a few enumerated sections any more than it is limited to 3. The proviso makes sense if it is read to reserve all mineral rights under the right of way, as well as to reserve mineral lands in the alternate sections of public land granted in aid of the construction of the road. Indeed, we can see no other way to construe it if it is to apply, as it does, not merely to 3, but to the entire Act, including 2 which grants the right of way.\n\nThe reservation of the mineral resources of these public lands for the United States was in keeping with the policy of the times. The gold strike in California in 1848 made the entire country conscious of the potential riches underlying the western part of the public domain. The method of asserting federal control over mineral lands was not finally settled until the Act of July 26, 1866, 14 Stat. 251, prescribed the procedure by which mineral lands could be acquired. But meanwhile - from 1849 to 1866 - the federal policy was clear. As the Court said in Mining Co. v. Consolidated Mining Co., \n102 \nU.S. 167\n, the federal policy during this interim period was to reserve mineral lands, not to grant them. The policy was found to be so \"uniform\" in this interim period (id., at 175) that the Court, in construing an 1853 Act governing public lands in California, held that a grant to California did not include mineral lands, although they were not specifically excepted.\n\nThe case is much stronger here, for \"mineral lands\" are specifically reserved. It is, therefore, wholly in keeping with the federal policy that prevailed in 1862, when the present right of way was granted, to construe \"mineral \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n lands\" to include mineral resources under the right of way. For it was the mineral riches in the public domain that Congress sedulously sought to preserve until it formulated the special procedure by which all mineral resources were to be administered. In United States v. Sweet, \n245 \nU.S. 563\n, Mr. Justice Van Devanter, our foremost expert on public land law, discussed this policy at length and cited in support of this federal policy the very Act we have under consideration in the present case. Id., p. 569, n. 1. And see Barden v. Northern Pacific R. Co., \n154 \nU.S. 288, 317\n-318. We would have to forget history and read legislation with a jaundiced eye to hold that when Congress granted only a right of way and reserved all \"mineral lands\" it nonetheless endowed the railroad with the untold riches underlying the right of way. Such a construction would run counter to the established rule that land grants are construed favorably to the Government, that nothing passes except what is conveyed in clear language, and that if there are doubts they are resolved for the Government, not against it. Caldwell v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 14, 20\n-21. These are the reasons we construe \"mineral lands\" as used in 3 of the Act to include mineral rights in the right of way granted by 2.\n\nThe system which Congress set up to effectuate its policy of reserving mineral resources in the alternate sections of public land granted by 3 was by way of an administrative determination, prior to issuance of a patent, of the mineral or nonmineral character of the lands. Patents were not issued to land administratively determined to constitute mineral lands. And, the administrative determination was final. Burke v. Southern Pacific R. Co., \n234 \nU.S. 669\n. Such an administrative system was obviously inappropriate to the right of way granted by 2. The land needed for the right of way was \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n not acquired through the issuance of a patent, but by the filing of a map showing the definite location of the road, followed by its actual construction. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Townsend, supra, at 270.\n\nA provision for prior administrative determination of which land in the path of the right of way constituted mineral lands would have been inappropriate for another reason. As already noted, the route of the railroad had to be determined by engineering considerations which could not allow for the extensive detours that the avoidance of land containing minerals would make necessary.\n\nBecause the administrative system, by which the exception of \"mineral lands\" was administered in relation to the lands granted by 3, is inappropriate to the right of way granted by 2, we are urged to conclude that the exception of \"mineral lands\" in 3 was not intended to apply to 2. But, construing the grant in 2 favorably to the Government, as we must, we cannot conclude that Congress meant the policy it expressed, by excepting \"mineral lands\" in 3, to be inapplicable to 2 in the face of its admonition that the exception is applicable to the entire Act. Nor can we conclude that, because the administrative system, by which mineral resources in the grant of land under 3 were reserved, was inappropriate to 2, Congress did not intend appropriate measures to reserve minerals under the right of way granted by 2. We cannot assume that the Thirty-seventh Congress was profligate in the face of its express purpose to reserve mineral lands.\n\nTo be sure, Congress later on designed a more precise and articulated system for the separation of subsoil rights from the other rights in the western lands. See, for example, the Act of March 3, 1909, 35 Stat. 844. It would have been better draftsmanship, if, in referring to 2, Congress had used the words \"mineral rights\" instead of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n \"mineral lands.\" Yet it will not do for us to tell the Congress \"We see what you were driving at but you did not use choice words to describe your purpose.\"\n\nSome reliance is placed on a line of decisions of the Court which describe the rights of way under early railroad land grants as limited fees. These cases were, for the most part, controversies between the railroad and third persons and involved problems so remote from the present one as to be inapt as citations. For example, the leading case raised the question whether third parties could establish valid homesteads on the railroad right of way after the right of way had been located and the tracks laid. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Townsend, supra. An answer in favor of the railroad on the ground that it had a limited fee could hardly be an adjudication concerning the ownership of mineral resources underlying the right of way in a contest between the United States and the railroad. In only one of the cases cited was the United States a party; and in that case the question did not involve mineral rights but jurisdiction over a person transporting liquor. If the right of way was Indian Country when it crossed an Indian reservation, then a violation of the liquor laws had occurred. The Court held that the right of way was not Indian Country and said in passing that the right of way constituted the fee in the land. Clairmont v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 551, 556\n. We do not stop to examine the other cases\n2\n using \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n like language to describe the railroad's right of way, because in none of them was there a contest between the United States and the railroad-grantee over any mineral rights underlying the right of way. The most that the \"limited fee\" cases decided was that the railroads received all surface rights to the right of way and all rights incident to a use for railroad purposes.\n\nGreat reliance is placed on Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 262\n, for the view that the grant of a right of way in the year 1862 was the grant of a fee interest. In that case we noted that a great shift in congressional policy occurred in 1871: that after that period only an easement for railroad purposes was granted, while prior thereto a right of way with alternate sections of public land along the right of way had been granted. In the latter connection we said, \"When Congress made outright grants to a railroad of alternate sections of public lands along the right of way, there is little reason to suppose that it intended to give only an easement in the right of way granted in the same act.\" Id., at 278. But we had no occasion to consider in the Great Northern case the grant of a right of way with the reservation of \"mineral lands.\" The suggestion that a right of way may at times be more than an easement was made in an effort to distinguish the earlier \"limited fee\" cases. To complete the distinction, Mr. Justice Murphy with his usual discernment added, \"None of the cases involved the problem of rights to subsurface oil and minerals.\" Id., at 278. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 120]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe latter statement goes to the heart of the matter. There are no precedents which give the mineral rights to the owner of the right of way as against the United States. We would make a violent break with history if we construed the Act of 1862 to give such a bounty. We would, indeed, violate the language of the Act itself. To repeat, we cannot read \"mineral lands\" in 3 as inapplicable to the right of way granted by 2 and still be faithful to the standard which governs the construction of a statute that grants a part of the public domain to private interests.\n\n       Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] To that effect are administrative decisions, by officers of the Interior Department dealing with comparable statutes, that a congressional grant of land \"for railroad purposes\" does not carry the right to drill for oil or to remove solid minerals.

JUSTICE BURTON and MR.

The controversy arises out of the Act of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat. 489, the purpose of which is described by its title \"An Act to aid in the Construction of a Railroad and Telegraph Line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the Government the Use of the same for Postal, Military, and Other Purposes.\" The Government claimed that 2 of that Act, in granting respondent's predecessor in title \"the right of way through the public lands\" for the construction of a railroad, did not vest the railroad with any interest in the underlying minerals. The District Court for the District of Wyoming granted judgment for respondent. It held that the Act of 1862 \"granted to Union Pacific a fee simple determinable, sometimes called a base, qualified or limited fee, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 121]\n\u00a0\n of the lands contained within the right of way, subject only to an implied condition of reverter in the event that Union Pacific ceases to use the right of way,\" and that this gave Union Pacific sole right to the underlying minerals, which had not been reserved by the United States. 126 F. Supp. 646. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed this judgment. 230 F.2d 690.\n\nSection 2 of the Act of 1862 provides:\n\n \"And be it further enacted, That the right of way  through the public lands be, and the same is hereby,  granted to said company for the construction of said  railroad and telegraph line; and the right, power, and  authority is hereby given to said company to take  from the public lands adjacent to the line of said  road, earth, stone, timber, and other materials for  the construction thereof; said right of way is granted  to said railroad to the extent of two hundred feet in  width on each side of said railroad where it may pass  over the public lands, including all necessary grounds  for stations, buildings, workshops, and depots, machine  shops, switches, side tracks, turntables, and  water stations. The United States shall extinguish  as rapidly as may be the Indian titles to all lands  falling under the operation of this act and required  for the said right of way and grants hereinafter  made.\"\n\n\n As additional aid toward construction of the line, 3 granted the railroad five alternate sections of public land per mile on each side of the road, with the qualification that \"all mineral lands shall be excepted from the operation of this act.\" And 5 and 11 provided for the issuance to the company, upon its completion of a prescribed number of miles of track, of United States bonds of an aggregate value of not less than $16,000 nor more than $48,000 per mile, depending on the difficulty of the terrain. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 122]\n\u00a0\n Two years later, Congress amended the Act to double the number of alternate sections of land granted in aid of construction, 13 Stat. 356.\n\nThis Act of 1862 was one of a series of statutes providing assistance to individually named railroads to promote their construction. The Act of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 365, gave an even greater amount of land to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and in 1866 other Acts were passed for the benefit of the St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad Company, 14 Stat. 210; the Kansas and Neosho Valley Railroad Company, 14 Stat. 236; the California and Oregon Railroad Company, 14 Stat. 239; the southern branch of the Union Pacific Company, 14 Stat. 289; and the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company, 14 Stat. 292. Each of these statutes contained a grant substantially identical with that made by 2 of the Act of 1862, the object of our immediate concern.\n\nSection 2 was, on the face of it, a specific grant contained in a specific statute designed to achieve a specific, contemporaneous goal - construction of a railroad. Unlike constitutional provisions such as the Due Process Clause or enactments such as the Sherman Law that embody a felt rather than defined purpose and necessarily look to the future for the unfolding of their content, making of their judicial application an evolutionary process nourished by relevant changing circumstances, a specific grant like 2 does not gain meaning from time. Its scope today is what it was in 1862, and the judicial task is to ascertain what content was conveyed by that section in 1862. Did the Thirty-seventh Congress grant the entire present interest, the fee, in the land forming the right of way, or did it convey merely a right of passage, an easement, retaining for the United States all other rights in the land, including the right to its minerals?\n\nIn a line of decisions going back to Railroad Co. v. Baldwin, \n103 \nU.S. 426\n, this Court has consistently recognized \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 123]\n\u00a0\n that the Act of 1862 and its companion Acts gave to the railroads the entire present interest in the public lands allocated to them for a right of way. In the Baldwin case, the Court dealt with the grant of the right of way to the St. Joseph & Denver Railroad under one of the 1866 statutes, 14 Stat. 210. It stated that\n\n \". . . the grant of the right of way . . . contains no reservations or exceptions. It is a present absolute grant, subject to no conditions except those necessarily implied, such as that the road shall be constructed and used for the purposes designed. Nor is there anything in the policy of the government with respect to the public lands which would call for any qualification of the terms.\" Id., at 429-430.\n\n\n A similar grant of the right of way, in an 1866 grant to the southern branch of the Union Pacific Company, 14 Stat. 289, was repeatedly characterized in Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Roberts, \n152 \nU.S. 114\n, as being \"absolute in terms, covering both the fee and possession.\" Id., at 117. In New Mexico v. United States Trust Co., \n172 \nU.S. 171, 181\n-182, the Court acknowledge that the term \"right of way\" had two distinct meanings: (1) a \"mere right of passage\"; and (2) \"`that strip of land which railroad companies take upon which to construct their roadbed.' That is, the land itself - not a right of passage over it.\" The Court held that the right of way granted to the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad by another of the 1866 Acts, 14 Stat. 292, was of the latter class, relying on the Roberts case.\n\nNorthern Pacific R. Co. v. Townsend, \n190 \nU.S. 267\n, made even more plain the Court's view that when Congress in the 1860's granted a railroad right of way it conveyed the entire present interest in the strip of land. This was a suit by the railroad against one whose predecessors in title had, after the road was constructed, begun \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 124]\n\u00a0\n adverse possession of part of the right of way and had subsequently obtained homestead patents to the section of land over which the road passed. Mr. Justice White began the Court's opinion by stating:\n\n \"At the outset, we premise that, as the grant of the right of way, the filing of the map of definite location, and the construction of the railroad within the quarter section in question preceded the filing of the homestead entries on such section, the land forming the right of way therein was taken out of the category of public lands subject to preemption and sale, and the land department was therefore without authority to convey rights therein. It follows that the homesteaders acquired no interest in the land within the right of way because of the fact that the grant to them was of the full legal subdivisions.\" Id., at 270.\n\n\n The Court then went on to hold that the right of way granted by the Act of 1864 gave the railroad \"a limited fee, made on an implied condition of reverter in the event that the company ceased to use or retain the land for the purpose for which it was granted\" and that to allow private parties to acquire part of this land by adverse possession would defeat Congress' plainly manifested desire that the entire right of way continue to be the grantee's so long as the railroad was maintained.\n\nAll later opinions of the Court concerning the railroad statutes of the '60's express an undeviating adherence to the scope given to this grant as announced by the Baldwin case, supra, in 1881. E. g., Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Ely, \n197 \nU.S. 1, 6\n; Clairmont v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 551, 556\n; Union Pacific R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., \n231 \nU.S. 190, 198\n; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Oklahoma, \n271 \nU.S. 303, 308\n. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 125]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis consistent course of construction is bound to give the impression that Congress was rather free-handed in its disposition of the public domain ninety years and more ago. And so it was. We said in Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 262, 273\n:\n\n \"Beginning in 1850, Congress embarked on a policy of subsidizing railroad construction by lavish grants from the public domain. Typical were the Illinois Central Grant, Act of September 20, 1850, c. 61, 9 Stat. 466; Union Pacific Grant of July 1, 1862, c. 120, 12 Stat. 489; Amended Union Pacific Grant, Act of July 2, 1864, c. 216, 13 Stat. 356; and Northern Pacific Grant, Act of July 2, 1864, c. 217, 13 Stat. 365. This last grant was the largest, involving an estimated 40,000,000 acres. In view of this lavish policy of grants from the public domain it is not surprising that the rights of way conveyed in such land-grant acts have been held to be limited fees. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Townsend, \n190 \nU.S. 267\n. Cf. Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Roberts, \n152 \nU.S. 114\n.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n During this period \"there passed into the hands of western railroad promoters and builders a total of 158,293,000 acres, an area almost equaling that of the New England states, New York and Pennsylvania combined.\" \"Land Grants,\" 9 Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (1935) 32, 35. The powerful Thaddeus Stevens, himself the proponent of the Northern Pacific bill, spoke with authoritative truthfulness when he said of the House Committee that approved it: \"the committee was willing to give to the company almost any amount [of land] that it thought it could make use of . . . .\" in order to induce \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 126]\n\u00a0\n construction of the railroad. Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess. 1698.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThis \"lavish\" congressional policy brought results, for in 1869 the much desired transcontinental route was completed. With realization of the goal, however, the mood \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 127]\n\u00a0\n of uncritical enthusiasm toward railroad enterprises began to veer. The Court summarized the consequences of this shift in popular feeling in the Great Northern case:\n\n \"This policy [of \"lavish grants from the public  domain\"] incurred great public disfavor, which was  crystallized in the following resolution adopted by  the House of Representatives on March 11, 1872:\n\n\n  \"`Resolved, That in the judgment of this House  the policy of granting subsidies in public lands to railroads  and other corporations ought to be discontinued,  and that every consideration of public policy  and equal justice to the whole people requires that  the public lands should be held for the purpose  of securing homesteads to actual settlers, and for  educational purposes, as may be provided by law.'  Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 1585 (1872).  After 1871 outright grants of public lands to private  railroad companies seem to have been discontinued.  But, to encourage development of the Western vastnesses,  Congress had to grant rights to lay track  across the public domain, rights which could not be  secured against the sovereign by eminent domain  proceedings or adverse user. For a time special acts  were passed granting to designated railroads simply  `the right of way' through the public lands of the  United States. That those acts were not intended  to convey any land is inferable from remarks in Congress  by those sponsoring the measures. . . .\n\n\n  \"The burden of this special legislation moved  Congress to adopt the general right of way statute  now before this Court. . . .\" \n315 \nU.S., at 273\n-275  (footnotes omitted).\n\n\n The General Right of Way Statute of 1875, 18 Stat. 482, was significantly different from the Act of 1862 and its companions. It granted the railroads neither alternate \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 128]\n\u00a0\n sections of public land nor direct financial subsidy. The right of way provided for was half the width of that given by the 1862 and 1864 laws. And 2 of the Act stated that any railroad whose right of way ran through a canyon, pass or defile \"shall not prevent any other railroad company from the use and occupancy of the said canyon, pass, or defile, for the purposes of its road, in common with the road first located . . . .\" Moreover, 4 required the recipient of each right of way to note its location on the plats in the local land office, and provided that \"thereafter all such lands over which such right of way shall pass shall be disposed of subject to such right of way . . . .\"\n\nDetailed study of the history of federal right of way legislation led us to conclude in the Great Northern case that a right of way granted by the 1875 Act was an easement and not a limited fee.\n3\n From this it followed that the railroad had no right to the underlying minerals. Basic to the Court's characterization of the right of way as an easement was the recognition that \"Since it [the General Right of Way Statute] was a product of the sharp change in Congressional policy with respect to railroad grants after 1871, it is improbable that Congress intended by it to grant more than a right of passage, let alone mineral riches.\" Id., at 275. The change in congressional policy was found to be reflected in the language of the statute, which strongly suggested the grant of a right of use and occupancy only. Especially persuasive was the provision of 4 that \"lands over which such right of way \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 129]\n\u00a0\n shall pass shall be disposed of subject to such right of way.\" Id., at 271, 278. Legislative history and substantially contemporaneous administrative construction confirmed this view.\n4\n These strong differentiating factors led the Court to conclude that the line of cases interpreting the lavish pre-1871 grants was not controlling. But no doubt was cast upon the scope to be attributed to those decisions with respect to the Act of 1862 and its associated measures: \"When Congress made outright grants to a railroad of alternate sections of public lands along the right of way, there is little reason to suppose that it intended to give only an easement in the right of way granted in the same act. And, in none of those acts \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 130]\n\u00a0\n was there any provision comparable to that of 4 of the 1875 Act . . . .\" Id., at 278.\n\nThe significance of the imposing body of opinions culminating in the Townsend case is not diminished if one acknowledges, as was done in Great Northern, that they did not explicitly decide the rights to minerals. As we have seen, in case after case this Court determined the railroad's interest in the right of way granted by the pre-1871 laws to be a limited fee. This term has a settled meaning - it denotes present ownership of the entire interest in land, an ownership that will continue so long as a stated contingency, leading to a reverter, does not occur. The Court's repeated use of this highly technical term was not inadvertent. In the United States Trust Co. case, for example, in reply to the contention that the Roberts case was not controlling because the distinction between an easement and a fee had not been presented there, the Court said:\n\n\". . . The difference between an easement and the fee would not have escaped his [Mr. Justice Field's] attention and that of the whole court, with the inevitable result of committing it to the consequences which might depend upon such difference.\" \n172 \nU.S., at 182\n.\n\n\n The Court then went on to hold that one of the consequences of the railroad's fee interest in the right of way, i. e., its ownership of \"the land itself,\" was exemption from state taxation of improvements erected thereon. Another of those consequences, of course, is ownership of the minerals underlying the right of way. Certainly this was acknowledged in Townsend when the Court held that the land forming the right of way was no longer public land and that, consequently, the Land Department was \"without authority to convey rights therein\" and those claiming under government patents \"acquired no interest \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 131]\n\u00a0\n in the land within the right of way.\" See supra, p. 124. If mineral rights had not been included in the fee, the patents issued by the United States would have conveyed those rights. The legal consequence that mineral rights are embraced in a grant that conveys a limited fee governed the judgment of two federal courts that were called upon to construe a similar grant made to the Illinois Central by the Act of 1850. United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., 89 F. Supp. 17; affirmed, 187 F.2d 374.\n5\n To argue that the \"limited fee\" that the long, unbroken line of cases found in the right of way grant in these enactments of the '60's granted a fee merely in the surface is to palter with language and with our decisions. \"Surface\" could not, of course, mean merely the area that is seen by the eye. To say that it means the visual area and an indeterminate depth - x inches or x feet - necessary for support is to ask the Court to rewrite legislation and to cast upon it administrative tasks in order to accomplish a policy that seems desirable a hundred years after Congress acted on a different outlook. No wonder that this Court did not accept such an inadmissible retrospective reading of a statute when the Government pressed it on us in the Great Northern case. See Argument for the United States, \n315 \nU.S., at 269\n.\n\nThe Townsend case also serves to refute the suggestion that the railroad in its use of the right of way is confined to what in 1957 is narrowly conceived to be \"a railroad purpose.\" Townsend flatly reaffirmed what its predecessors stated - that the grant should be construed \"as though the land had been conveyed in terms to have and to hold the same so long as it was used for the railroad \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 132]\n\u00a0\n right of way.\" \n190 \nU.S., at 271\n. The Court recognized that the land could revert to the grantor only in the event that it was used in a manner inconsistent with the operation of the railroad, a situation contrary to that found by the District Court in this case. Had Congress desired to make a more restrictive grant of the right of way, there would have been no difficulty in making the contingency for the land's reversion its use for any purpose other than one appropriately specified. Cf. Caldwell v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 14\n; Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co. v. United States, 140 F.2d 436. But, as we have seen, the congressional policy in 1862 was one of liberality, prodigality as it later came to appear, in order to encourage the construction of the railroad. It is inconceivable that the Congress that made generous loans to the Union Pacific and granted it enormous areas of land for resale at substantial gain would have balked at its profitable resort to the minerals underneath the right of way in a manner completely consistent with the satisfactory operation of the railroad. Further support for this view is provided by 3 of the 1864 amendment to the Act before us. It gave the railroad power to take by eminent domain a two-hundred-foot right of way over privately owned land, and demonstrates that, in granting four-hundred-foot strips of public land to Union Pacific and Northern Pacific, Congress pursued a conscious policy of providing these railroads with more land than was necessary merely to provide a site for their construction. As the Baldwin case recognized, \"The right of way for the whole distance of the proposed route was a very important part of the aid given.\" \n103 \nU.S., at 430\n. Out of respect for the generous policy embodied in pre-1871 legislation, this Court has until today recognized the railroad's right to enjoy its fee interest in the right of way. See Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Smith, \n171 \nU.S. 260, 275\n-276. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 133]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is said that 3's exception of \"mineral lands\" from its grant of alternate sections of public land may also have been an inept way of reserving the rights to the minerals underneath the right of way granted by 2. This attributes to the 1862 Congress a desire to convey only the fee interest in the surface. Such attribution contradicts the scheme both of the Act itself and of subsequent public land legislation. The Act plainly contemplated, and was interpreted to provide, an administrative determination of the mineral character of the land granted by 3 prior to the issuance of the patent. Land found to be \"mineral\" was not patented but was replaced by other land. If minerals were subsequently found on patented land, they were held to belong to the railroad, and not to the Government, Burke v. Southern Pacific R. Co., \n234 \nU.S. 669\n, notwithstanding 3's exception of \"mineral lands.\" Since this exception did not reserve the right to minerals in land that passed under 3 itself, it is difficult to understand how it could have reserved the right to minerals in land that passed as a right of way under 2. The fact that the exception was made applicable to the entire Act may be explained without distorting 2. Sections 9, 13, and 14 of the 1862 Act authorize construction of certain other railroads \"upon the same terms and conditions in all respects as are provided in this act for the construction of the\" Union Pacific. By amending 3's proviso to cover the entire Act, Congress left no doubt that the exception of mineral lands also applied to the land grants made to those other railroads.\n\nIf Congress had reserved the right to the minerals underlying the thousands of miles of right of way granted by its transcontinental railroad legislation of 1862, 1864 and 1866, it might reasonably be expected that it would have manifested some consciousness of this reservation when, in the Act of July 26, 1866, 14 Stat. 251, it finally settled upon a general federal mineral policy. This is \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 134]\n\u00a0\n particularly true in view of the fact that the policy determined was not one of zealously reserving the minerals for the Government but one of making the country's mineral riches readily available for immediate development by private interests. Section 1 of the Act provided \"That the mineral lands of the public domain . . . are hereby declared to be free and open to exploration and occupation . . . .\" Other sections set forth the conditions for acquiring mineral lands. Yet nowhere in the Act is there intimation of government ownership of the mineral rights now found, for the first time, to have been reserved by Congress in its grants to the railroads in the 1860's.\n\nThis failure of Congress to provide for disposition of the minerals lying beneath the right of way may not fairly be attributed to oversight. No congressional policy of reserving mineral rights from public land grants was in existence in the 1860's. Such a policy did not begin to evolve until the last decade of the nineteenth century, when Congress reserved the mineral rights to certain lands sold to cities for cemetery and park purposes, 26 Stat. 502. And it received its first general application in the Act of March 3, 1909, 35 Stat. 844, which permitted agricultural entrymen on public lands subsequently found to contain coal deposits to obtain patents to the land, with coal rights reserved to the United States. The novelty of thus separating surface ownership from ownership of the subsoil was made plain by a colloquy in the House debate on this Act:\n\n \"Mr. Stephens of Texas. I desire to know the difference between this law which the gentleman proposes and the law as it now exists. What change is proposed, and why?\n\n\n \"Mr. Mondell [of Wyoming, Chairman of the House Public Lands Committee]. . . . This bill simply provides that in any case where, subsequent \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 135]\n\u00a0\n to the location or the entry, the character of the land has been called into question the entryman may, if he so elect, accept a limited patent. It is the first legislation before Congress providing for a limited patent, or a patent reserving the mineral. . . .\n\n\n \"Mr. Stephens of Texas. Is it not a fact that valuable minerals are reserved now to the Government?\n\n\n \"Mr. Mondell. No; that is not true. The patent having issued, the patent carries everything in the land with it . . . .\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\"In other words, the patents issued by the Government of the United States heretofore have been patents in fee.\" 43 Cong. Rec. 2504.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n In 1910 the Act was extended to provide for issuance of patents to lands that were known to contain coal at the time they were settled for agricultural purposes. 36 \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 136]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 583. The Surface Patent Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 509, applied the statutory policy with respect to coal to all withdrawn non-metallic mineral lands. This Act has been described as \"perhaps the first serious attempt, not locally limited, to sever the surface title from the mineral title in disposing of the public domain.\" Morrison and De Soto, Oil and Gas Rights, 508. It was followed by the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 862, which reserved all minerals to the United States while providing for the granting of surface patents. Significantly, in the comprehensive Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 437, Congress did what it had not done in 1866 - it set forth a plan for the development of the minerals that the 1909-1916 Acts had reserved for the United States.\n\nThe Thirty-seventh Congress was confronted with what it deemed the pressing need to stimulate the rapid construction of a transcontinental railroad. In the Act of 1862 it offered the Union Pacific luring incentives to attempt this task, which \"many intelligent persons considered insurmountable.\" United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n91 \nU.S. 72, 80\n. The specific grant contained in 2 has long been interpreted as conveying the entire present interest in the land forming the right of way. This body of opinions, written by members of the Court more steeped in public land law and more sensitive to the circumstances of the times than we can possibly be, seems to me to constitute too weighty a construction of 2 to be now overturned. It is of course the Court's duty to enforce the will of Congress once that has been reasonably ascertained from the language in which Congress expressed its will. But the ascertainment of what Congress meant from what it said, in legislation like that before the Court, does not gain clarity with time so as to displace the uniform construction put by this Court from the beginning, almost eighty years ago, on what Congress said. The Court cannot in 1957 retrieve what Congress \n\n[353 \nU.S. 112, 137]\n\u00a0\n granted in 1862. The hindsight that reveals the Act as lavish or even profligate ought not to influence the Court to narrow the scope of the 1862 grant by reading it in the light of a policy that did not mature until half a century thereafter. As the Court said in a very early construction of the Act before us: \"No argument can be drawn from the wisdom that comes after the fact.\" United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., supra, at 81.\n\nI would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The last three sentences quoted were a footnote to the first sentence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] When striving to understand the basis for this bountiful congressional policy, it is helpful to recall what this Court said in United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n91 \nU.S. 72, 79\n-80:\n\n\"Many of the provisions in the original act of 1862 are outside of the usual course of legislative action concerning grants to railroads, and cannot be properly construed without reference to the circumstances which existed when it was passed. The war of the rebellion was in progress; and, owing to complications with England, the country had become alarmed for the safety of our Pacific possessions . . . . It is true, the threatened danger was happily averted; but wisdom pointed out the necessity of making suitable provision for the future. This could be done in no better way than by the construction of a railroad across the continent. Such a road would bind together the widely separated parts of our common country, and furnish a cheap and expeditious mode for the transportation of troops and supplies. . . .\n\n\n\". . . Although this road was a military necessity, there were other reasons active at the time in producing an opinion for its completion besides the protection of an exposed frontier. There was a vast unpeopled territory lying between the Missouri and Sacramento Rivers which was practically worthless without the facilities afforded by a railroad for the transportation of persons and property. With its construction, the agricultural and mineral resources of this territory could be developed, settlements made where settlements were possible, and thereby the wealth and power of the United States largely increased; and there was also the pressing want, in time of peace even, of an improved and cheaper method for the transportation of the mails, and of supplies for the army and the Indians.\n\n\n\"It was in the presence of these facts that Congress undertook to deal with the subject of this railroad. The difficulties in the way of building it were great, and by many intelligent persons considered insurmountable.\"\n\n\n These compelling considerations led Congress to offer the Union Pacific Company what Mr. Chief Justice Waite called \"extraordinary inducements.\" Sinking-Fund Cases, \n99 \nU.S. 700, 723\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Great Northern decision departed from the Court's earlier construction of the General Right of Way Statute in Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, \n239 \nU.S. 44\n. The Stringham case, written by Mr. Justice Van Devanter, held, on the basis of the cases dealing with pre-1871 legislation, that right of way granted by the 1875 Act \"is . . . a limited fee, . . . and carries with it the incidents and remedies usually attending the fee.\" Id., at 47.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In explaining why the House Public Lands Committee had inserted a clause similar to 4 of the 1875 Act in a special right of way bill considered in 1872, Congressman Slater stated:\n\n\"The point is simply this: the land over which this right of way passes is to be sold subject to the right of way. It simply provides that this right of way shall be an incumbrance upon the land for one hundred feet upon each side of the line of the road; that those who may afterward make locations for settlement shall not interfere with this right of way.\n\n\n\"Mr. Speer, of Pennsylvania. It grants no land to any railroad company?\n\n\n\"Mr. Slater. No, sir.\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess. 2137. And in the House debate on the 1875 Act itself, Congressman Hawley said:\n\n\n\"It simply and only gives the right of way. It merely grants to such railroad companies as may be chartered the right to lay their tracks and run their trains over the public lands; it does nothing more.\" 3 Cong. Rec. 407.\n\n\n The earliest administrative construction of the 1875 Act plainly stated that the railroad received an easement rather than a fee. The Land Department Circular of January 13, 1888, said:\n\n\"The act of March, 3, 1875, [sic] is not in the nature of a grant of lands; it does not convey an estate in fee, either in the `right of way' or the grounds selected for depot purposes. It is a right of use only, the title still remaining in the United States.\" 12 L. D. 423, 428.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Apparently this has always been respondent's understanding of the right of way grant, for the District Court found that \"It has long been the practice of the defendant when entering into leases of portions of its right of way to reserve the right to retake possession for mineral operations.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The executive officers who sponsored passage of the 1909 Act recognized that they were advocating a new policy. Secretary of the Interior Garfield's 1907 report to the President stated:\n\n\". . . I can not urge too strongly the need of a change in the policy hitherto adopted by the Government for the disposition of the coal land.\n\n\n\". . . The experience in other sections of our country and abroad leads me to believe that the best possible method . . . is for the Government to retain the title to the coal, and to lease under proper regulations which will induce development when needed, prevent waste, and prevent monopoly. Such a method permits the separation of the surface from the coal and the unhampered use of the surface for purposes to which it may be adapted.\" Report of the Secretary of the Interior 15 (1907), H.

WITKOVICH(1957)\nNo. 295\nArgued: February 28, 1957Decided: April 29, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Appellee was indicted under 242 (d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 on the charge that, as an alien against whom a final order of deportation had been outstanding for more than six months, he had willfully failed to give information requested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service under the purported authority of clause (3) of that Section. The information he was charged with failing to furnish concerned (1) present membership in and activities on behalf of the Communist Party and other organizations, and (2) associations with particular individuals. Held: Construing clause (3) of 242 (d) in the context of the entire Section and of the scheme of the legislation as a whole, with due regard to the principle of so construing statutes as to avoid raising constitutional questions, the information an alien is required to furnish under clause (3) relates solely to his availability for deportation; and dismissal of the indictment for failure to state an offense is sustained. Pp. 194-202.\n\n 140 F. Supp. 815, affirmed.\n\nJohn F. Davis argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop.\n\nPearl M. Hart argued the cause for appellee. With her on the brief was Cyril D. Robinson.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAppellee was indicted under 242 (d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 208, originally part of 23 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1010, on the charge that, as an alien against whom a final order of deportation had been outstanding \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 195]\n\u00a0\n for more than six months, he had willfully failed to give information to the Immigration and Naturalization Service as required by that section. Appellee moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds, inter alia, that it failed to state an offense within the statute and in the alternative, if it did so, that the statute was unconstitutional. The District Court held that the statute as construed by it was not unconstitutional. 140 F. Supp. 815. Thereupon the United States filed a motion for clarification of the court's opinion, and appellee filed a supplemental motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the statute as construed by the district judge did not authorize the Government to elicit the demanded information. The District Court, in a second opinion, dismissed the indictment for failure to state an offense. 140 F. Supp., at 820. The case was brought here, \n352 \nU.S. 817\n, under the Criminal Appeals Act of 1907, as amended, 18 U.S.C. 3731.\n\nThe Section, as amended, 68 Stat. 1232, 8 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 1252 (d), is as follows:\n\n \"(d) Any alien, against whom a final order of deportation as defined in subsection (c) heretofore or hereafter issued has been outstanding for more than six months, shall, pending eventual deportation, be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. Such regulations shall include provisions which will require any alien subject to supervision (1) to appear from time to time before an immigration officer for identification; (2) to submit, if necessary, to medical and psychiatric examination at the expense of the United States; (3) to give information under oath as to his nationality, circumstances, habits, associations, and activities, and such other information, whether or not related to the foregoing, as the Attorney General may deem fit and proper; and (4) to conform to such \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 196]\n\u00a0\n reasonable written restrictions on his conduct or activities as are prescribed by the Attorney General in his case. Any alien who shall willfully fail to comply with such regulations, or willfully fail to appear or to give information or submit to medical or psychiatric examination if required, or knowingly give false information in relation to the requirements of such regulations, or knowingly violate a reasonable restriction imposed upon his conduct or activity, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\"\n\n\n The District Court construed 242 (d) as conferring upon the Attorney General \"power to supervise the alien to make sure he is available for deportation, and no further power.\" Accordingly, it held that clause (3) of this subsection is to be restricted to require only \"such information as is necessary to enable the Attorney General to be certain that the alien is holding himself in readiness to answer the call to be deported when it comes.\" 140 F. Supp., at 819-820. The court found that the questions listed in the indictment, which are set forth in the margin,\n*\n were not relevant to appellee's availability for deportation. \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 197]\n\u00a0\n The interpretation that the District Court thus placed on 242 (d) was derived from a consideration of its relation to the entire statutory scheme of deportation of which it is a part. The court below was further guided by the principle that requires courts, when construing statutes, to avoid constitutional doubts. \"To hold that the statute intended to give an official the unlimited right to \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 198]\n\u00a0\n subject a man to criminal penalties for failure to answer absolutely any question the official may decide to ask would raise very serious constitutional questions.\" Id., at 821.\n\nThe Government does not support the questions put to the alien on the basis of the construction that the District Court placed upon 242 (d). This construction authorizes all questions reasonably appropriate to keep the Attorney General advised regarding the continued availability for departure of a deportable alien. The Government contends that the District Court misconceived the scope of the statute. It points to what it characterizes as \"the eloquent breadth\" of clause (3), whereby the alien is to give \"such other information, whether or not related to the foregoing, as the Attorney General may deem fit and proper.\" This, says the Government, establishes a requirement \"in the broadest possible statutory terms for the furnishing of information by the alien.\" And this view, it maintains, fits into the statutory scheme. In the circumstances defined by 242 (a), an alien may be detained pending determination of deportability; and 242 (c) authorizes such detention for six months after the alien has been found deportable. So, the Government argues, 242 (d), though it does not authorize detention after six months, is an attempt to accomplish in a modified form the ends that would justify detention in the earlier stages of the deportation process. Our decision in Carlson v. Landon, \n342 \nU.S. 524\n, is heavily invoked. If, so the argument runs, detention of active alien Communists pending deportation hearings was sustainable under 242 (a), the national interest in avoiding recurrence of past Communist activity for which appellee is being deported should at least require him to answer questions regarding any present Communist relationships. For this view of the purpose of supervision, support is found in two other statutory provisions: \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 199]\n\u00a0\n 242 (e), making an alien's wilful failure to leave the country a felony but providing for suspension of sentence and release of the alien upon judicial consideration, inter alia, of the effect of release upon the national security and the likelihood of resumption of conduct that serves as a basis for deportation; and the recital in 2 (13) of the Internal Security Act of 1950, that \"numerous aliens who have been found to be deportable, many of whom are in the subversive, criminal, or immoral classes . . . are free to roam the country at will without supervision or control.\" 64 Stat. 987.\n\nThe language of 242 (d) (3), if read in isolation and literally, appears to confer upon the Attorney General unbounded authority to require whatever information he deems desirable of aliens whose deportation has not been effected within six months after it has been commanded. The Government itself shrinks from standing on the breadth of these words. But once the tyranny of literalness is rejected, all relevant considerations for giving a rational content to the words become operative. A restrictive meaning for what appear to be plain words may be indicated by the Act as a whole, by the persuasive gloss of legislative history or by the rule of constitutional adjudication, relied on by the District Court, that such a restrictive meaning must be given if a broader meaning would generate constitutional doubts.\n\nThe preoccupation of the entire subsection of which clause (3) is a part is certainly with availability for deportation. Clause (1) requires the alien's periodic appearance for the purpose of identification, and clause (2) dealing with medical and psychiatric examination, when necessary, clearly is directed to the same end; and the \"reasonable written restrictions on [the alien's] conduct or activities\" authorized by clause (4) have an implied scope to be gathered from the subject matter, i. e., the object of the statute as a whole. Moreover, this limitation \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 200]\n\u00a0\n of \"reasonableness\" imposed by clause (4) upon the Attorney General's power to restrict suggests that, if we are to harmonize the various provisions of the section, the same limitation must also be read into the Attorney General's seemingly limitless power to question under clause (3). For, assuredly, Congress did not authorize that official to elicit information that could not serve as a basis for confining an alien's activities. Nowhere in 242 (d) is there any suggestion of a power of broad supervision like unto that over a probationer. When Congress did want to deal with the far-flung interest of national security or the general undesirable conduct of aliens, it gave clear indication of this purpose, as in 242 (e). In providing for the release of aliens convicted of wilful failure to depart, that subsection specifically requires courts to inquire into both the effect of the alien's release upon national security and the likelihood of his continued undesirable conduct.\n\nThe legislative history likewise counsels confinement of the mere words to the general purpose of the legislative scheme of which clause (d) is a part, namely, the actual deportation of certain undesirable classes of aliens. Section 242 (d), as it was reported by the House Judiciary Committee and passed by the House in 1949, was in its present state in all but one significant respect. It provided for indefinite detention of any alien who willfully failed to comply with the regulations, to appear, to give information or to submit to medical examination, or who knowingly gave false information or violated a reasonable restriction upon his activity. H. R. Rep. No. 1192. 81st Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 2-3. The report of the House Committee, although in several places focusing only upon availability for deportation, does indicate concern over the threat to the national interest represented by undesirable but undeportable aliens. The Senate Judiciary Committee, while sharing the desire of the House \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 201]\n\u00a0\n to control the activities of such aliens, substituted for the House bill's detention provision the imposition of criminal penalties for failure to comply with the conditions of supervision. The report of the Senate Committee significantly states the reason for the change: \"This provision in the bill as it passed the House of Representatives appears to present a constitutional question.\" S. Rep. No. 2239, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 8. This history, although suggesting a desire to exercise continuing control over the activities as well as the availability of aliens whose deportation had been ordered but not effected, shows a strong congressional unwillingness to enact legislation that may subject the Attorney General's supervisory powers to constitutional challenge.\n\nAcceptance of the interpretation of 242 (d) urged by the Government would raise doubts as to the statute's validity. By construing the Act to confer power on the Attorney General and his agents to inquire into matters that go beyond assuring an alien's availability for deportation we would, at the very least, open up the question of the extent to which an administrative officer may inhibit deportable aliens from renewing activities that subjected them to deportation. See 70 Harv. L. Rev. 718. This is not Carlson v. Landon, supra, where the question was whether an alien could be detained during the customarily brief period pending determination of deportability. Contrariwise, and as the Senate and House Committees recognized in passing on 242 (d), supervision of the undeportable alien may be a lifetime problem. In these circumstances, issues touching liberties that the Constitution safeguards, even for an alien \"person,\" would fairly be raised on the Government's view of the statute.\n\nThe path of constitutional concern in this situation is clear.\n\n  \"When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 202]\n\u00a0\n constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\" Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 62\n.\n\n\n See also cases cited in the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 348\n, note 8.\n\nSection 242 (d) is part of a legislative scheme designed to govern and to expedite the deportation of undesirable aliens, and clause (3) must be placed in the context of that scheme. As the District Court held and as our own examination of the Act confirms, it is a permissible and therefore an appropriate construction to limit the statute to authorizing all questions reasonably calculated to keep the Attorney General advised regarding the continued availability for departure of aliens whose deportation is overdue. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] \"(a) Q.

JUSTICE BURTON joins, dissenting.\n\nThe Congress has authorized the Attorney General to retain an alien in custody during the pendency of deportation proceedings. 66 Stat. 208, 8 U.S.C. 1252 (a). This Court approved such custody in Carlson v. Landon, \n342 \nU.S. 524\n (1952). The Congress has also authorized the Attorney General to retain an alien in custody for six months subsequent to a final order of deportation within which to \"effect the alien's departure.\" 66 Stat. 210, 8 U.S.C. 1252 (c). The section here in question further declares that an alien under a final order of \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 203]\n\u00a0\n deportation for over six months \"shall, pending eventual deportation, be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General.\" 64 Stat. 1011, as amended, 8 U.S.C. (Supp. IV) 1252 (d). The Attorney General has implemented this provision by a regulation requiring the alien, inter alia, to \"Give information under oath as to his nationality, circumstances, habits, associations and activities, and other information whether or not related to the foregoing as may be deemed fit and proper.\" 8 CFR 242.3 (c) (3). This language was taken from subsection (3) of 8 U.S.C. 1252 (d), the source of the Attorney General's power of supervision. But today the Court has denied the Attorney General the right to question the deportee in regard to activities in conjunction with the deportee's prior conduct on which the deportation order was based. By its interpretation the Court has deleted the crux of this subsection from the Act and limited this phase of the Attorney General's \"supervision\" of aliens under final deportation order for over six months solely to interrogation relevant to the availability of the alien for deportation. In this respect the construction places an alien who has been under a final order of deportation for more than six months in a more favorable position than one who is under no order at all. Other aliens are obliged to report to the Attorney General when called upon to do so. Indeed, they must testify or claim their privilege. No privilege was claimed here. The Congress could not have intended the anomalous result reached today, one which is entirely foreign to its over-all plan of control over resident aliens. For the power of the Attorney General over aliens generally see 66 Stat. 223-225, 8 U.S.C. 1301-1306.\n\nThe majority reasons that the entire subsection of which clause (3) is a part is preoccupied with an alien's availability for deportation. We believe, however, that \"the danger to the public safety of [the alien's] presence \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 204]\n\u00a0\n within the community,\" United States ex rel. Potash v. District Director of Immigration and Naturalization, 169 F.2d 747, 751 (1948), was the basis on which the Congress placed this power with the Attorney General. In short, \"the alien's anticipated personal conduct . . . [based on his past action] must be considered.\" See the dissenting opinion in Carlson v. Landon, supra, at 563-564. And so here, highly relevant to the decision regarding any additional supervision that is to be placed over appellee, or the removal of any prior supervision, is information as to whether he has resumed his past activities in the Communist Party. Yet the Court does not allow inquiry into this and related areas unless it is necessary to determine appellee's availability for deportation. The Attorney General is thereby deprived of this information vital to the exercise of his supervisory duties.\n\nThe statute was motivated by national security problems with which the Congress felt impelled to deal. In 1252 (d) Congress was not concerned with \"actual deportation,\" but with that class of deportees who could not be deported because no country would permit them entrance. It believed that an alien finally ordered deported but who could no longer be held in custody pending eventual effectuation of the order should be under the supervision of the Attorney General. All aliens, regardless of their status, are under some supervision and must answer inquiries in respect to: (1) the date and place of their entry into the United States; (2) the activities in which they have been and intend to be engaged; (3) the length of time they expect to remain in the United States; (4) their police or criminal record, if any; and (5) such additional matters as may be prescribed. 66 Stat. 224, 8 U.S.C. 1304 (a). In addition, all aliens must register\n1\n and be \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 205]\n\u00a0\n fingerprinted, 66 Stat. 224, 8 U.S.C. 1302; they must notify the Attorney General of their address annually and any change must be filed within 10 days thereof, 66 Stat. 225, 8 U.S.C. 1305. Criminal penalties are imposed for willful failure to comply with any of these registration provisions, 66 Stat. 225, 8 U.S.C. 1306. Congress thought that deportees should have closer supervision than other aliens. As the Court indicated in Carlson v. Landon, supra, at 538, \"aliens arrested for deportation would have opportunities to hurt the United States . . . .\" Deportees have a stronger motivation for carrying on subversive activities than other persons and are more likely to adopt old habits, return to old haunts, and resume old activities. Since 1939 Congress had been considering the tightening of controls over such aliens. Even then a bill introduced in Congress referred to \"the likelihood of the alien's resuming the course of conduct which made him deportable.\" H. R. 5643, 76th Cong., 1st Sess.; 84 Cong. Rec. 5179. In the Eighty-first Congress a House Committee declared in comment on its bill which contained a provision similar to that here involved, \"The situation has now become so serious . . . that the committee feels that the enactment of legislation of this type is a necessity, not only to the proper administration of the immigration laws, but from the standpoint of the national security of the United States.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1192, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8. Before the presidential veto of the proposed Internal Security Act of 1950, H. R. 9490, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., of which this provision was a part, \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 206]\n\u00a0\n but to which the President expressed no opposition on constitutional grounds,\n2\n a substitute bill had been offered in the Senate.\n3\n This proposal contained the identical language which this Court now reads out of the Act, i. e., requiring the alien to give \"information under oath as to his nationality, circumstances, habits, associations, and activities, and such other information, whether or not related to the foregoing, as the Attorney General may deem fit and proper.\" While this substitute bill was not enacted, the same language was included within the present Act, showing that the section here involved has long been acceptable to all sides. In view of the legislative history of the forerunners of the present provision it is surprising that the Court now reads out of the Act the identical language which has repeatedly been included by the Congress. In so doing the Court deprives the Attorney General of a power of supervision over deportees that he possesses and exercises every day over other aliens not under deportation orders.\n\nThe Court takes the position that any construction other than that today adopted \"would, at the very least, open up the question of the extent to which an administrative officer may inhibit deportable aliens from renewing activities that subjected them to deportation.\" But no such question is involved here. As the trial judge puts the issue, it is whether the Congress may constitutionally \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 207]\n\u00a0\n give the Attorney General \"the unlimited right to subject a man to criminal penalties for failure to answer absolutely any question . . . .\" 140 F. Supp., at 821. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the Attorney General attempted further to \"inhibit\" the appellee \"from renewing activities that subjected [him] to deportation.\" It may be that the Attorney General would have tried further to \"inhibit\" appellee if the answers put to him had indicated any necessity therefor in the interest of national security. But that stage was never reached. All the Attorney General undertook was to question appellee. He got no answers. And the Court, in affirming, prevents the Attorney General from obtaining any answers to the questions. It is for this reason that we dissent. The scope of the Attorney General's right to inquiry is the sole issue here. The Congress beyond any question gave the Attorney General the authority he exercised. Whether it placed further authority in his hands to \"inhibit\" the alien's activities is not involved. We, therefore, see no necessity of invoking the rule of avoidance of constitutional questions. There are none to avoid for the Attorney General clearly has the right to question as to activities indicated by past conduct. It will be soon enough to pass on other supervisory powers when they are here.\n\nHowever, since the majority has enlarged the issue to include the power to restrict the alien's activities we feel it necessary to comment thereon. We believe that the purpose of the Act was to prevent a deportable alien from using the period of his further residence for the continuation of subversive, criminal, immoral, or other undesirable activities which formed the basis of his ordered deportation. This is a part of the \"congressional plan\" with reference to control of subversive activities within the United States. Pennsylvania v. Nelson, \n350 \nU.S. 497, 503\n-504 (1956). Several thousand alien Communists who have \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 208]\n\u00a0\n been finally ordered deported will from now on, due to the Court's decision today, be under virtually no statutory supervision. Still they will, in all probability, remain among us for neither they nor the countries of which they are nationals wish them to leave. To their countries they are potential agents. The House Committee on the Judiciary recognized this danger in its report on facilitating the deportation of aliens. H. R. Rep. No. 1192, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8-13. Case histories set out in this report indicate that aliens ordered deported were refused visas by their native countries so that they might remain in the United States and carry on the very activities for which they were ordered deported. See also Hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization of the Committee on the Judiciary on S. 1832, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 323. Were the deportee to cease the activity, no doubt his native land would issue the requisite visa and deal with him when he was returned.\n\nIn our view the power of the Congress with respect to aliens is exceedingly broad. Nothing points this out more forcibly than our own cases. Congress may expel any noncitizen it may determine is undesirable. The power given here is merely supplemental to that of expulsion and is a necessary concomitant thereof under the circumstances here presented. It gives to the Attorney General supervision of alien deportees whose past record discloses activities dangerous to our people. The appellee does not contest the charge as to his past activities. As we see it, the Congress has merely provided limited supervision which might prevent the alien from resuming the activity which brought on his ordered deportation. It may turn out that further limited supervisory precautions need not be exercised over appellee. However, we are in no position to know. The Attorney General himself does not know because he was prevented \n\n[353 \nU.S. 194, 209]\n\u00a0\n from requiring the alien to give him the information. It is vital to effective supervision by the Attorney General for him to have the information he sought here. We believe that the counterbalancing necessity of preventing further detrimental conduct, or at least providing the authorities charged with the internal security of our country with some warning signal of it, substantially out-weighs \"issues touching liberties\" which might be raised by the interrogation. Like \"the police establishment of fire lines during a fire . . . the validity of the restraints . . . depends on all the conditions which obtain at the time . . . .\" Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81, 99\n (1943).\n\nTo us jailing alien deportees on the basis of our safety pending deportation proceedings as well as for six months thereafter, admittedly valid, is largely futile if the Attorney General cannot subsequently supervise them effectively.

Subsequently, the husband sued for divorce in Nevada. The wife was not served with process and did not appear in the Nevada court; but it entered a final decree of divorce, providing that both husband and wife were \"freed and released from the bonds of matrimony and all duties and obligations thereof.\" Subsequently, the wife sued in New York for separation from the husband and alimony. The New York court did not have personal jurisdiction over the husband; but it sequestered his property in the State and entered an order directing the husband to make support payments to the wife. Held: Since the Nevada court had no personal jurisdiction over the wife, it had no power to extinguish any right she had under New York law to financial support from her husband, its decree was void insofar as it purported to do so, and the New York judgment did not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Pp. 416-419.\n\n 1 N. Y. 2d 342, 135 N. E. 2d 553, affirmed.\n\nSol A. Rosenblatt argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Charles Roden.\n\nMonroe J. Winsten argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was Charles L. Raskin for Vanderbilt, respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nCornelius Vanderbilt, Jr., petitioner, and Patricia Vanderbilt, respondent, were married in 1948. They separated in 1952 while living in California. The wife moved to New York where she has resided since February 1953. In March of that year the husband filed suit for \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 417]\n\u00a0\n divorce in Nevada. This proceeding culminated, in June 1953, with a decree of final divorce which provided that both husband and wife were \"freed and released from the bonds of matrimony and all the duties and obligations thereof . . . .\"\n1\n The wife was not served with process in Nevada and did not appear before the divorce court.\n\nIn April 1954, Mrs. Vanderbilt instituted an action in a New York court praying for separation from petitioner and for alimony. The New York court did not have personal jurisdiction over him, but in order to satisfy his obligations, if any, to Mrs. Vanderbilt, it sequestered his property within the State.\n2\n He appeared specially and, among other defenses to the action, contended that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution\n3\n compelled the New York court to treat the Nevada divorce as having ended the marriage and as having destroyed any duty of support which he owed the respondent. While the New York court found the Nevada decree valid and held that it had effectively dissolved the marriage, it nevertheless entered an order, under 1170-b \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 418]\n\u00a0\n of the New York Civil Practice Act,\n4\n directing petitioner to make designated support payments to respondent. 207 Misc. 294, 138 N. Y. S. 2d 222. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the support order. 1 N. Y. 2d 342, 135 N. E. 2d 553. Petitioner then applied to this Court for certiorari contending that 1170-b, as applied, is unconstitutional because it contravenes the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\n5\n We granted certiorari, \n352 \nU.S. 820\n.\n\nIn Estin v. Estin, \n334 \nU.S. 541\n, this Court decided that a Nevada divorce court, which had no personal jurisdiction over the wife, had no power to terminate a husband's obligation to provide her support as required in a preexisting New York separation decree. The factor which distinguishes the present case from Estin is that here the wife's right to support had not been reduced to judgment prior to the husband's ex parte divorce. In our opinion this difference is not material on the question before us. Since the wife was not subject to its jurisdiction, the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which she had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband. It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.\n6\n Here, the Nevada divorce court \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 419]\n\u00a0\n was as powerless to cut off the wife's support right as it would have been to order the husband to pay alimony if the wife had brought the divorce action and he had not been subject to the divorce court's jurisdiction. Therefore, the Nevada decree, to the extent it purported to affect the wife's right to support, was void and the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not obligate New York to give it recognition.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner claims that this case is governed by Thompson v. Thompson, \n226 \nU.S. 551\n. For the reasons given in a concurring opinion in Armstrong v. Armstrong, \n350 \nU.S. 568, 575\n, at 580-581, the Thompson case, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It seems clear that in Nevada the effect of this decree was to put an end to the husband's duty to support the wife - provided, of course, that the Nevada courts had power to do this.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n\nThe question in this case is whether Nevada, which was empowered to grant petitioner a divorce without personal jurisdiction over respondent that must be respected, by command of the Constitution, by every other State, Williams v. North Carolina, \n317 \nU.S. 287\n, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 420]\n\u00a0\n was at the same time empowered by virtue of its domiciliary connection with petitioner to make, incidental to its dissolution of the marriage, an adjudication denying alimony to which sister States must also give full faith and credit. Whatever the answer to the question may be, Estin v. Estin, \n334 \nU.S. 541\n, does not supply it. What the Court now states to be \"not material\" was crucial to the decision in that case, namely, the prior New York support order, which the Court held Nevada was required to respect by virtue of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, 1, of the Constitution. That this fact was crucial to the Court's decision in that case is made clear by the Court's reference to the prior New York judgment in its two statements of the question presented and more than a half dozen times throughout the course of its opinion. The Court rightly regarded the fact as crucial because of the requirement of Art. IV, 1, that Nevada give full faith and credit to the prior New York \"judicial Proceedings.\"\n\nThe Court now chooses to regard the existence of a prior New York support order as \"not material,\" holding for the first time that \"the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which [respondent] had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband. It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant [citing for this proposition, Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714, 726\n-727].\" We have thus reached another stage - one cannot say it is the last - in the Court's tortuous course of constitutional adjudication relating to dissolution of the marriage status. Whereas previously only the State of \"matrimonial domicile\" could grant an ex parte divorce and alimony, now any domiciliary State can grant an ex parte divorce, but no State, even if domiciliary, can grant alimony ex parte when it grants a divorce ex parte. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 421]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt will make for clarity to give a brief review of the singular history of matrimonial law in this Court since the decision in Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 \nU.S. 155\n. In that case, the Court held that a sister State had to give full faith and credit to a divorce granted, on the basis of constructive service, by the matrimonial domicile to a deserted husband. In Haddock v. Haddock, \n201 \nU.S. 562\n, the Court refused to extend Atherton, holding that a State need not give full faith and credit to a divorce granted ex parte to a deserted husband by a domiciliary State other than the matrimonial domicile. These precedents were applied to the incidental claim to alimony in Thompson v. Thompson, \n226 \nU.S. 551\n, where the Court held that full faith and credit was to be given to the refusal of the matrimonial domicile to grant alimony when it granted a divorce on the basis of substituted service. Under the pre-Williams law, then, the same jurisdictional rules applied to the dissolution of the marriage tie and to an incidental adjudication denying alimony. Not only the adjudication of divorce but also the adjudication denying alimony by the matrimonial domicile was required to be given full faith and credit despite the lack of personal jurisdiction over the other spouse.\n\nIn Williams v. North Carolina, I, \n317 \nU.S. 287\n, the scope of Art. IV, 1, was found to require full faith and credit to be given to a divorce granted ex parte by any State where one spouse was domiciled. The limitation of ex parte divorces to the matrimonial domicile imposed by Haddock v. Haddock was rejected as being based on \"fiction.\" Williams v. North Carolina, II, \n325 \nU.S. 226\n, made it clear that full faith and credit was required to be given only if the granting State was actually a domiciliary State, that the finding on this issue could not be foreclosed by the decreeing State, and that it could be readjudicated later by another State. But this restriction of Williams II was considerably weakened \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 422]\n\u00a0\n when the Court held that a sister State, no matter how great its interest because of its own social policy, was precluded from relitigating the existence of the jurisdictional facts underlying a divorce when both parties had merely made an appearance in the original divorce proceeding. Sherrer v. Sherrer, \n334 \nU.S. 343\n, and Coe, v. Coe, \n334 \nU.S. 378\n. This was so even if the collateral attack were made by a third party who had not appeared in the original proceeding and who had independent interests. Johnson v. Muelberger, \n340 \nU.S. 581\n.\n\nThe decisions from Williams I through Johnson resulted in a broad extension of the scope of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Haddock v. Haddock was rejected, not because it gave too little respect to the rights of the absent spouse, but rather because it gave too much respect to those rights, and not enough to the rights of the other spouse and his or her domiciliary State. The interests of the absent spouses were subordinated to the interests of the other spouses and their domicile of divorce in Williams I, and the interests of a State that was allegedly both pre-divorce and post-divorce domicile were subordinated to the interest of the temporary \"domicile\" of divorce in Sherrer and Coe.\n\nOne might have expected that since Thompson v. Thompson, supra, was based on Haddock v. Haddock, it would have suffered the same fate. But no. The law is not so logical. The Court shrinks from applying Williams I to Thompson. In fact, we are now told that the vice of Thompson v. Thompson is just the opposite of that of Haddock v. Haddock: Thompson paid too little respect to the rights of the absent spouse and too much to the rights of the other spouse and his domicile. And so, as compensation, the interests of the absent spouse, which the Court subordinated so far as the breaking up of the marital relation was concerned in Williams I, are now to be enlarged, so far as alimony is concerned. The requirement \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 423]\n\u00a0\n of Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n, that there must be personal jurisdiction in an action to recover a judgment for personal services rendered, was before the Court in Haddock, in Thompson, and in Williams I. Although it was found in all three cases not to be applicable to the unique interests and factors pertaining to the severance of the marriage status and the incidental determination denying alimony, it is now treated as a controlling precedent.\n\nA normal action for divorce comprehends dissolution of the marital relation and, incident thereto, a property arrangement between the parties. I stand on the Williams decisions; and so I start from the proposition that full faith and credit must be given to an ex parte divorce granted by a State that is the domicile of one of the parties. The only legal question for our concern in this case is whether the other aspect of, and indeed an incident to, a proceeding for divorce, the property arrangement, is similar enough to the dissolution of the marital relation, with respect to both the interests of the parties and the nature of what is adjudicated, that constitutionally it may be treated alike.\n\nHaddock v. Haddock and Thompson v. Thompson proceeded on the basis that they should be treated alike. The Court, however, solves all with the statement, \"It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.\" This is an artful disguise for labeling the action with the question-begging phrase, \"in personam.\" A dogmatic, unanalyzed disregard of the difficulties of a problem does not make the problem disappear. Strictly speaking, all rights eventually are \"personal.\" For example, a successful suit in admiralty against a ship results of course not in loss to the ship but to its owner. The crucial question is: what is the fair way to proceed against these \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 424]\n\u00a0\n interests? May a State deal with the dissolution of a marriage comprehensively, or must it chop up the normal incidents of the cause of action for divorce?\n\nNo explanation is vouchsafed why the dissolution of the marital relation is not so \"personal\" as to require personal jurisdiction over an absent spouse, while the denial of alimony incident thereto is. Calling alimony a \"personal claim or obligation\" solves nothing. I note this concern for \"property rights,\" but I fail to see why the marital relation would not be worthy of equal protection, also as a \"personal claim or obligation.\" It may not be translatable into dollars and cents, but that does not make it less valuable to the parties. It cannot be assumed, by judicial notice as it were, that absent spouses value their alimony rights more highly than their marital rights. Factually, therefore, both situations involve the adjudication of valuable rights of an absent spouse,\n1\n and I see no reason to split the cause of action and hold that a domiciliary State can ex parte terminate the marital relation, but cannot ex parte deny alimony. \"Divisible divorce\" is just name-calling.\n2\n I would therefore hold that \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 425]\n\u00a0\n Nevada had jurisdiction to make the determination it made with respect to alimony and that New York must give full faith and credit to the whole Nevada judgment, not just to part of it.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Court's decision, besides turning the constitutional law of marital relations topsy-turvy, has created numerous problems whose solution is far from obvious. The absent spouse need no longer appear in the divorcing State in order to be present when an adjudication is made. She (or he) may sue wherever she can serve the other spouse or attach his property. What will happen in States that grant alimony only as incident to a divorce? Most States do not have statutes like the New York statute involved in the present case. Would this Court require any State in which one spouse catches another to entertain a cause of action for alimony? This is a far cry from what was involved in Hughes v. Fetter, \n341 \nU.S. 609\n. Also, it is not even settled what the relation of a State to an ex-wife and an ex-husband must be for the State, as a matter of due process, to be able to grant support on the basis that the parties were once man and wife.\n\nAnother view, agreeing that Nevada can adjudicate alimony ex parte incident to its granting a divorce ex parte, at least for purposes of its own law, would then hold that New York is not compelled to give full faith and credit to the valid Nevada judgment. \"New York's law and policy is,\" so the argument runs, \"that the right of a married woman domiciled in New York to support \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 426]\n\u00a0\n survives an ex parte divorce, whether obtained in New York or elsewhere. . . . The interest of New York in her domiciliaries seems . . . to be of sufficient weight to justify allowing her to apply her own policy on the question of what effect ex parte divorces will be given as against the surviving support rights of her own domiciliaries.\"\n\nTo begin with, it cannot be pretended that New York is not discriminating against alimony adjudications in all out-of-state ex parte divorces, for a divorce granted to a husband in New York against a wife who is not served personally in New York is not ex parte if the wife is a New York domiciliary. Her domicile provides a basis of jurisdiction that would be sufficient in an ordinary non-matrimonial action. See Williams v. North Carolina, I, \n317 \nU.S. 287, 298\n-299; Milliken v. Meyer, \n311 \nU.S. 457, 463\n.\n\nTo go to the heart of the matter, the Full Faith and Credit Clause is itself a constitutional adjustment of the conflicting interests of States, and we are not free, by weighing contending claims in particular cases, to make readjustments of the conflicting interests as if the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not exist. The clause requires that \"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the . . . judicial Proceedings of every other State.\" See also 28 U.S.C. 1738. It is true that the commands of the Full Faith and Credit Clause are not inexorable in the sense that exceptional circumstances may relieve a State from giving full faith and credit to the judgment of a sister State because \"obnoxious\" to an overriding policy of its own. But such instances \"have been few and far between, apart from Haddock v. Haddock.\" See Williams v. North Carolina, I, \n317 \nU.S. 287, 294\n-295.\n\nOf course New York has substantial connection with a domiciliary who has been divorced ex parte in Nevada, but that provides no justification for allowing it to refuse \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 427]\n\u00a0\n to give full faith and credit to that part of the Nevada judgment denying alimony. A State desiring to deny full faith and credit to the judgment of another State almost always has such a connection. Whatever the unusual circumstances that may justify making an exception to the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, this case does not present them because, for the reasons I have already stated, no stronger state policy can be urged in this case than was overridden in Williams I. Blanket discrimination against ex parte alimony decrees of sister States therefore subordinates the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to the policy of New York.\n\nTo justify the New York law as a \"mere survival of a pre-existing right\" is only another proof that \"the word `right' is one of the most deceptive of pitfalls; it is so easy to slip from a qualified meaning in the premise to an unqualified one in the conclusion.\" American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n256 \nU.S. 350, 358\n. There can be no \"right\" until the termination of the marriage, and the whole question in the case is which State shall be able to determine the incidents of the dissolution of the marriage status. Nor is analysis furthered by analogizing the \"right\" to alimony to the dower \"right,\" thence sliding to the conclusion that since New York would not have to recognize the Nevada decree cutting off dower, it does not have to recognize the Nevada decree cutting off alimony. The differences between a \"right\" to alimony and a dower \"right\" are so decisive that I need not spell out why an assumed decision with respect to dower does not reach our problem.\n\nWe are also told that \"the interest of the wife in not becoming single and penniless is greater than her interest in not becoming single.\" This is doubtless a correct statement of fact and might furnish a basis for legislation \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 428]\n\u00a0\n of a kind not at issue in this case, since the New York law is based on its right to disregard all ex parte alimony decrees and not on an interest it may have in the indigent condition of former wives.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nFor me, the rigorous commands of the Full Faith and Credit Clause are determinative. I cannot say that the Nevada judgment denying alimony is more \"obnoxious\" to New York policy (as expressed in 1170-b of its Civil Practice Act) than its judgment of divorce. Since New York is required to give full faith and credit to the one, it is to the other.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Custody over children presents an entirely different problem. See May v. Anderson, \n345 \nU.S. 528\n. The interests of independent human beings, the children, are involved. Also, insofar as the spouses' interests are concerned, the divorce may terminate their relations with each other as husband and wife, but it cannot terminate their relation to their children. They are still parents.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"The deceptive appeal of the phrase `divisible divorce' should not be permitted to obscure the basic concepts involved. A finding of divisibility may be appropriate where, as in Estin, the particular right at issue is a distinct property right, embodied in a previously granted judgment, which is no longer dependent, for its recognition or enforcement, upon the marital relationship, or where, as in Armstrong, the court rendering the divorce has itself severed the issue of support and left it subject to separate adjudication in the future. The situation is, however, decidedly different where, as in the case before us, the claim asserted depends for its very existence on the continuance of the marital status and that status and its incidents \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 425]\n\u00a0\n have both been terminated by a jurisdictionally valid judgment of divorce.\" Judge Fuld, dissenting in this case in the New York Court of Appeals, 1 N. Y. 2d 342, 356-357, 135 N. E. 2d 553, 561. I would add that the concept of \"divisible divorce\" is a misnomer. The divorce is not divisible. It is the cause of action for terminating the marital relation and making a property arrangement that is divided.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] We are not told what a third State is to do if suit is brought there. Does New York or Nevada law control? Since, under this view, the husband's ex parte judgment denying alimony to the wife is a valid one, at least in Nevada, I would suppose that the wife could get a support judgment ex parte in New York. Then, there would be not merely a problem of choice of law in the third State, which has no domiciliary connection with either party, but rather a question of which judgment is entitled to full faith and credit in the third State.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nThe Court holds today, as I understand its opinion, that Nevada, lacking personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Vanderbilt, had no power to adjudicate the question of support, and that any divorce decree purporting so to do is to that extent wholly void - presumably in Nevada as well as in New York - under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pursuant to the doctrine of Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n.\n\nI cannot agree with such a holding. In the first place, as I see this case, there is no necessity to pass on this question at all. Our problem should be, initially at least, not whether this decree, insofar as it affects property, is \"void\" for lack of due process, but whether it binds New York \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 429]\n\u00a0\n under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. In other words, we need not, in the first instance, decide what the Due Process Clause forbids Nevada to do, but merely what the Full Faith and Credit Clause compels New York to do. One of the wisest of our constitutional commentators has warned us to beware the \"constricting necessitarianism\" of deeming the two questions to be one and the same:\n\n\"In a problem so fraught with infelicities whatever mediation is devised, there is wisdom in confining pronouncements closely to what is imperative in the particular case. It is not logically necessary to deny Nevada's mastery within her own boundaries in order to deny her power of projection beyond them. Freedom of home manufacture and consumption does not necessarily entail freedom of export. Only if it is inexorable that what is meant by `jurisdiction' must be either wholly absent or wholly unlimited need frailty in sister states be conditioned on total impotence at home.\" T. R. Powell, And Repent at Leisure, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 930, 936.\n\n\n Were we compelled to reach the question, I would by no means be ready to hold that Nevada, in connection with a valid divorce proceeding, had no power to adjudicate an incident so inextricably knit to the marriage status as is support. I would agree with Judge Fuld, dissenting below, that the denial of power to Nevada rests on the \"erroneous premise that a mere incident of the marital status, which `in itself furnishes no foundation for a cause of action' . . . is the equivalent of an independent right.\"\n1\n Nor does it help to label Mrs. Vanderbilt's claim to support a \"property\" right and therefore an in \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 430]\n\u00a0\n personam, rather than an in rem, matter. If it is due process for Nevada to adjudicate the marriage status of a domiciliary without personal service over the absent spouse (as it clearly is, see Williams v. North Carolina, I, \n317 \nU.S. 287\n), I see no reason why Nevada cannot, at least for the purposes of her own law, also adjudicate the incidents of that status.\n\nI do not think, however, that this forecloses the issue before us. I revert, therefore, to what, for me, is the real question in this case: must New York respect Nevada's decree insofar as it purports to adjudicate the question of support? The answer to this question, I think, turns squarely on an issue of New York law, namely, whether Mrs. Vanderbilt was domiciled in New York at the time of the divorce.\n\nIf Mrs. Vanderbilt was a New York domiciliary at the time of the divorce, the situation would seem to me to be as follows: New York's law and policy is that the right of a married woman domiciled in New York to support survives an ex parte divorce, whether obtained in New York or elsewhere. The only question under the Full Faith and Credit Clause is whether New York is compelled to disregard her own law and policy in favor of the law of Nevada on the question of the survival of support rights subsequent to an ex parte divorce. My answer to this question is \"no.\" The interest of New York in her domiciliaries seems to me to be of sufficient weight to justify allowing her to apply her own policy on the question of what effect ex parte divorces will be given as against the surviving support rights of her own domiciliaries. In my view it does not follow automatically that merely because New York must recognize the validity of Nevada's ex parte divorce, she must also recognize the effect Nevada would give to that divorce in connection with the wife's rights to support. The two questions are \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 431]\n\u00a0\n governed by different considerations. I quote again from Professor Powell:\n\n\"The `irreconcilable conflict' between two states on the question of marital status is not so insuperable in dealing with matters of money. It is less irksome to support two wives than to go to jail because of them. Though with respect to status one state or the other must yield, with respect to maintenance such yielding is not necessary.\n\n\n \". . . `The problem under the full faith and credit clause is to accommodate as fully as possible the conflicting interests of the two States.' The solution is a matter of judgment in each case, judgment based not only on the particularities of the individual case or type of case but upon the desirability of as much generality and predictability as is consistent with a fair degree of control by a state over the conduct and the relationships of persons who in every substantial sense are its own home folks. . . .\n\n\n .  .  .   .  .\n\n\n  \"[It is argued] that the state where the stay-behind spouse has long been domiciled has an interest in making a quondam husband continue a prior obligation to support her, and that this interest is stronger and more meritorious than any possible opposing interest to prevent it that can be accredited to the state which gave him a divorce after being blindly satisfied that he intended an indefinite stay there. This seems so sensible that it should be obvious to any one who had never become confused by studying law.\" Powell, supra, at 952, 954-955.\n\n\n In effect, the situation before us seems to me to be analogous to dower. If New York law should provide that the dower rights of her domiciliaries survive ex parte \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 432]\n\u00a0\n divorces, I would suppose that New York could give effect to that policy in spite of an ex parte Nevada divorce which purported to cut off the right to dower. The problem in each case is to weigh the policy of giving an ex parte judgment uniform effect throughout the nation, against the interest of a particular State in a particular local policy. Where status is concerned, this Court held that the interest in certainty as to whether one is married or single outweighs the interest of home States in the marital status of their domiciliaries, so that North Carolina was forced to swallow Nevada's views as to what is sufficient cause for divorce even though the North Carolina wife had not appeared in the Nevada proceeding. Williams, I, supra. But I see no reason why we should extend that, for me, already somewhat unpalatable mediation to the limits of its logic in order to hold that Nevada's views as to support as well as divorce must be forced onto other States, and that Nevada can not only compel wives domiciled elsewhere to become single against their will, but to be pauperized against their will as well. Of course, the reason for the distinction is not that the wife's right to support is \"worth\" more than her interest in remaining a wife. But the interest of the wife in not becoming single and penniless is greater than her interest in not becoming single. In other words, merely because it is held that the wife must be deprived of one benefit ex parte, in the interest of national uniformity, does not compel us to hold that the other benefit must vanish with it, where the interest in national uniformity is not as compelling.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 433]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn deciding this case we must always remember that the reason why the Nevada ex parte divorce has the effect of a judgment in New York even on the question of status is because this Court found, in measuring the competing interests, that uniformity should prevail. It will not do, therefore, to say that once that is done the Court is foreclosed from weighing competing interests in determining the effect of the Nevada adjudication as to questions other than status. One cannot rest on the inexorability that the Nevada decree is a \"judgment\" and eliminate the fact that it was held to be a judgment outside Nevada as to status for reasons which do not necessarily apply to the question of support, any more than one can solve the problem by labeling support as a \"property\" right.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nQuite a different case is presented, it seems to me, where a wife becomes a domiciliary of New York after the ex parte divorce and is then granted support. In \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 434]\n\u00a0\n such a case New York could not pretend to be assuring the wife the mere survival of a pre-existing right, because the wife could have had no pre-divorce rights in New York at all. New York would merely be granting the wife a marital right in the teeth of a valid Nevada adjudication that there is no marriage. And, of course, at the time of the divorce New York would have had no interest in the situation of any kind. In such a case, therefore, it seems to me that the Full Faith and Credit Clause would require New York to respect the Nevada judgment as to support rights. Furthermore, even aside from the judgment, as a matter of choice of law I should think New York would be forced to look to the law of a State which had a substantial contact with these parties at the time of the divorce in determining the effect to be given to the divorce decree. It seems to me unfortunate that this Court should permit spouses divorced by valid decrees to comb the country, after the divorce, in search of any State where the divorcing spouse has property and which has favorable support laws, in order there to obtain alimony. I would therefore by no means hold the Nevada adjudication \"void\" and therefore of no effect in any State.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThus decision here, as I see it, turns on the domicile of Mrs. Vanderbilt at the time of the divorce. On this question I am left in some doubt. Section 1165-a of the New York Civil Practice Act makes one year's residence necessary to suits for support. This is amenable to the interpretation that New York would not recognize Mrs. Vanderbilt as domiciled in that State until the lapse of a year, that is, after the decree of divorce here involved. See de Meli v. de Meli, 120 N. Y. 485, 24 N. E. 996. On the other hand, the opinion below intimates that the one-year \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 435]\n\u00a0\n residency can be regarded as merely a procedural prerequisite to filing suit under 1170-b, and does not affect Mrs. Vanderbilt's status as a domiciliary of New York ab initio.\n5\n In view of this uncertainty in the state law, I would remand to the state court for reconsideration in light of the above-stated principles.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] N. Y. 2d 342, 357, 135 N. E. 2d 553, 561.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"It is easier to have a flat rule than to make distinctions based on judgment. Yet, from the standpoint of partitioning power among the several states, there may well be wisdom in having a gap between what due process will not forbid and what full faith and credit will not require. Certainly in suits over property and money there may be grounds that are thought good enough to justify a state in exerting \n\n[354 \nU.S. 416, 433]\n\u00a0\n its power so far as it relies wholly on its own strength and yet not so good that other states should be bound to lend a hand.\" Powell, supra, at 936; and see id., n. 14.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] For the most compendious exposition of the many situations where this Court has held that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not demand automatic respect in a sister State for a judgment valid in the State where rendered, see the dissent of Mr. Justice Stone and Mr. Justice Cardozo in Yarborough v. Yarborough, \n290 \nU.S. 202, 213\n. There can hardly be dispute over the proposition that \"in the assertion of rights, defined by a judgment of one state, within the territory of another, there is often an inescapable conflict of interest of the two states, and there comes a point beyond which the imposition of the will of one state beyond its own borders involves a forbidden infringement of some legitimate domestic interest of the other. That point may vary with the circumstances of the case; and in the absence of provisions more specific than the general terms of the congressional enactment this Court must determine for itself the extent to which one state may qualify or deny rights claimed under proceedings or records of other states.\" Id., at 215 (footnotes omitted).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Morris, Divisible Divorce, 64 Harv. L. Rev. 1287.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] I draw that implication from the following passage in the opinion of the Court of Appeals: \"But when the husband, abandoning his wife, left their California domicile to establish a Nevada domicile for his own purposes, the abandoned wife had a right to set up a New York domicile for herself and bring the matrimonial domicile to New York with her . . . . That right she exercised in this instance before the Nevada judgment was entered and she satisfied New York's residence requirements before suing for a separation . . . . We need not decide whether she would have the same right to come into New York, even after a foreign-State divorce, to take advantage of section 1170-b.\" 1 N. Y. 2d, at 351, 135 N.

UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 261\nArgued: March 7, 1957Decided: June 17, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was convicted of a violation of 2 U.S.C. 192, which makes it a misdemeanor for any person summoned as a witness by either House of Congress or any committee thereof to refuse to answer any question \"pertinent to the question under inquiry.\" Summoned to testify before a Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities, petitioner testified freely about his own activities and associations; but he refused to answer questions as to whether he had known certain other persons to have been members of the Communist Party. He based his refusal on the ground that those questions were outside of the proper scope of the Committee's activities and not relevant to its work. No clear understanding of the \"question under inquiry\" could be gleaned from the resolution authorizing the full Committee, the legislative history thereof, the Committee's practices thereunder, the action authorizing the Subcommittee, the statement of the Chairman at the opening of the hearings or his statement in response to petitioner's protest. Held: Petitioner was not accorded a fair opportunity to determine whether he was within his rights in refusing to answer, and his conviction was invalid under the Due Process Clause of Fifth Amendment. Pp. 181-216.\n\n (a) The power of Congress to conduct investigations, inherent in the legislative process, is broad; but it is not unlimited. P. 187.\n\n\n (b) Congress has no general authority to expose the private affairs of individuals without justification in terms of the functions of Congress. P. 187.\n\n\n (c) No inquiry is an end in itself; it must be related to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate task of Congress. P. 187.\n\n\n (d) The Bill of Rights is applicable to congressional investigations, as it is to all forms of governmental action. P. 188.\n\n\n (e) A congressional investigation is subject to the command that Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or press or assembly. Pp. 196-197. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 179]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (f) When First Amendment rights are threatened, the delegation of power to a congressional committee must be clearly revealed in its charter. United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n. P. 198.\n\n\n (g) A congressional investigation into individual affairs is invalid if unrelated to any legislative purpose, because it is beyond the powers conferred upon Congress by the Constitution. Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168\n. P. 198.\n\n\n (h) It cannot simply be assumed that every congressional investigation is justified by a public need that overbalances any private rights affected, since to do so would be to abdicate the responsibility placed by the Constitution upon the judiciary to insure that Congress does not unjustifiably encroach upon an individual's right of privacy nor abridge his liberty of speech, press, religion or assembly. Pp. 198-199.\n\n\n (i) There is no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure where the predominant result can be only an invasion of the private rights of individuals. P. 200.\n\n\n (j) In authorizing an investigation by a committee, it is essential that the Senate or House should spell out the committee's jurisdiction and purpose with sufficient particularity to insure that compulsory process is used only in furtherance of a legislative purpose. P. 201.\n\n\n (k) The resolution authorizing the Un-American Activities Committee does not satisfy this requirement, especially when read in the light of the practices of the Committee and subsequent actions of the House of Representatives extending the life of the Committee. Pp. 201-205.\n\n\n (l) Every reasonable indulgence of legality must be accorded to the actions of a coordinate branch of our Government; but such deference cannot yield to an unnecessary and unreasonable dissipation of precious constitutional freedoms. P. 204.\n\n\n (m) Protected freedoms should not be placed in danger in the absence of a clear determination by the House or Senate that a particular inquiry is justified by specific legislative need. P. 205.\n\n\n (n) Congressional investigating committees are restricted to the missions delegated to them - to acquire certain data to be used by the House or Senate in coping with a problem that falls within its legislative sphere - and no witness can be compelled to make disclosures on matters outside that area. P. 206. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (o) When the definition of jurisdictional pertinency is as uncertain and wavering as in the case of the Un-American Activities Committee, it becomes extremely difficult for the Committee to limit its inquiries to statutory pertinency. P. 206.\n\n\n (p) The courts must accord to a defendant indicted under 2 U.S.C. 192 every right which is guaranteed to defendants in all other criminal cases, including the right to have available information revealing the standard of criminality before the commission of the alleged offense. Pp. 207-208.\n\n\n (q) Since the statute defines the crime as refusal to answer \"any question pertinent to the question under inquiry,\" part of the standard of criminality is the pertinency of the questions propounded to the witness. P. 208.\n\n\n (r) Due process requires that a witness before a congressional investigating committee should not be compelled to decide, at peril of criminal prosecution, whether to answer questions propounded to him without first knowing the \"question under inquiry\" with the same degree of explicitness and clarity that the Due Process Clause requires in the expression of any element of a criminal offense. Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263\n. Pp. 208-209.\n\n\n (s) The authorizing resolution, the remarks of the chairman or members of the committee, or even the nature of the proceedings themselves, might make the \"question under inquiry\" sufficiently clear to avoid the \"vice of vagueness\"; but these sources often leave the matter in grave doubt. P. 209.\n\n\n (t) In this case, it is not necessary to pass on the question whether the authorizing resolution defines the \"question under inquiry\" with sufficient clarity, since the Government does not contend that it could serve that purpose. P. 209.\n\n\n (u) The opening statement of the Chairman at the outset of the hearings here involved is insufficient to serve that purpose, since it merely paraphrased the authorizing resolution and gave a very general sketch of the past efforts of the Committee. Pp. 209-210.\n\n\n (v) Nor was that purpose served by the action of the full Committee in authorizing the creation of the Subcommittee before which petitioner appeared, since it merely authorized the Chairman to appoint subcommittees \"for the purpose of performing any and all acts which the Committee as a whole is authorized to do.\" Pp. 211-212.\n\n\n (w) On the record in this case, especially in view of the precise questions petitioner was charged with refusing to answer, it cannot \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n be said that the \"question under inquiry\" was Communist infiltration into labor unions. Pp. 212-214.\n\n\n (x) Unless the subject matter of the inquiry has been made to appear with undisputable clarity, it is the duty of the investigative body, upon objection of the witness on grounds of pertinency, to state for the record the subject under inquiry at that time and the manner in which the propounded questions are pertinent thereto. Pp. 214-215.\n\n\n (y) The Chairman's response, when petitioner objected to the questions on grounds of pertinency, was inadequate to convey sufficient information as to the pertinency of the questions to the \"question under inquiry.\" Pp. 214-215.\n\n\n 98 U.S. App. D.C. 190, 233 F.2d 681, reversed and remanded.\n\nJoseph L.

Updegraff and Louis C. Wyman.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a review by certiorari of a conviction under 2 U.S.C. 192 for \"contempt of Congress.\" The misdemeanor is alleged to have been committed during a \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n hearing before a congressional investigating committee. It is not the case of a truculent or contumacious witness who refuses to answer all questions or who, by boisterous or discourteous conduct, disturbs the decorum of the committee room. Petitioner was prosecuted for refusing to make certain disclosures which he asserted to be beyond the authority of the committee to demand. The controversy thus rests upon fundamental principles of the power of the Congress and the limitations upon that power. We approach the questions presented with conscious awareness of the far-reaching ramifications that can follow from a decision of this nature.\n\nOn April 29, 1954, petitioner appeared as a witness in compliance with a subpoena issued by a Subcommittee of the Committee on Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives. The Subcommittee elicited from petitioner a description of his background in labor union activities. He had been an employee of the International Harvester Company between 1935 and 1953. During the last eleven of those years, he had been on leave of absence to serve as an official of the Farm Equipment Workers International Union, later merged into the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers. He rose to the position of President of District No. 2 of the Farm Equipment Workers, a district defined geographically to include generally Canton and Rock Falls, Illinois, and Dubuque, Iowa. In 1953, petitioner joined the United Automobile Workers International Union as a labor organizer.\n\nPetitioner's name had been mentioned by two witnesses who testified before the Committee at prior hearings. In September 1952, one Donald O. Spencer admitted having been a Communist from 1943 to 1946. He declared that he had been recruited into the Party with the endorsement and prior approval of petitioner, whom he identified as the then District Vice-President of the Farm Equipment \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n Workers.\n1\n Spencer also mentioned that petitioner had attended meetings at which only card-carrying Communists were admitted. A month before petitioner testified, one Walter Rumsey stated that he had been recruited into the Party by petitioner.\n2\n Rumsey added that he had paid Party dues to, and later collected dues from, petitioner, who had assumed the name, Sam Brown. Rumsey told the Committee that he left the Party in 1944.\n\nPetitioner answered these allegations freely and without reservation. His attitude toward the inquiry is clearly revealed from the statement he made when the questioning turned to the subject of his past conduct, associations and predilections:\n\n \"I am not now nor have I ever been a card-carrying member of the Communist Party. Rumsey was wrong when he said I had recruited him into the party, that I had received his dues, that I paid dues to him, and that I had used the alias Sam Brown.\n\n\n \"Spencer was wrong when he termed any meetings which I attended as closed Communist Party meetings.\n\n\n \"I would like to make it clear that for a period of time from approximately 1942 to 1947 I cooperated with the Communist Party and participated in Communist activities to such a degree that some persons may honestly believe that I was a member of the party.\n\n\n \"I have made contributions upon occasions to Communist causes. I have signed petitions for Communist \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 184]\n\u00a0\n causes. I attended caucuses at an FE convention at which Communist Party officials were present.\n\n\n \"Since I freely cooperated with the Communist Party I have no motive for making the distinction between cooperation and membership except the simple fact that it is the truth. I never carried a Communist Party card. I never accepted discipline and indeed on several occasions I opposed their position.\n\n\n \"In a special convention held in the summer of 1947 I led the fight for compliance with the Taft-Hartley Act by the FE-CIO International Union. This fight became so bitter that it ended any possibility of future cooperation.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n The character of petitioner's testimony on these matters can perhaps best be summarized by the Government's own appraisal in its brief:\n\n \"A more complete and candid statement of his past political associations and activities (treating the Communist Party for present purposes as a mere political party) can hardly be imagined. Petitioner certainly was not attempting to conceal or withhold from the Committee his own past political associations, predilections, and preferences. Furthermore, petitioner told the Committee that he was entirely willing to identify for the Committee, and answer any questions it might have concerning, `those persons whom I knew to be members of the Communist Party,' provided that, `to [his] best knowledge and belief,' they still were members of the Party . . . .\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Subcommittee, too, was apparently satisfied with petitioner's disclosures. After some further discussion elaborating on the statement, counsel for the Committee \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 185]\n\u00a0\n turned to another aspect of Rumsey's testimony. Rumsey had identified a group of persons whom he had known as members of the Communist Party, and counsel began to read this list of names to petitioner. Petitioner stated that he did not know several of the persons. Of those whom he did know, he refused to tell whether he knew them to have been members of the Communist Party. He explained to the Subcommittee why he took such a position:\n\n \"I am not going to plead the fifth amendment,  but I refuse to answer certain questions that I believe  are outside the proper scope of your committee's  activities. I will answer any questions which this  committee puts to me about myself. I will also  answer questions about those persons whom I knew  to be members of the Communist Party and whom  I believe still are. I will not, however, answer any  questions with respect to others with whom I associated  in the past. I do not believe that any law  in this country requires me to testify about persons  who may in the past have been Communist Party  members or otherwise engaged in Communist Party  activity but who to my best knowledge and belief  have long since removed themselves from the  Communist movement.\n\n\n  \"I do not believe that such questions are relevant  to the work of this committee nor do I believe that  this committee has the right to undertake the public  exposure of persons because of their past activities.  I may be wrong, and the committee may have this  power, but until and unless a court of law so holds  and directs me to answer, I most firmly refuse to discuss  the political activities of my past associates.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 186]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Chairman of the Committee submitted a report of petitioner's refusal to answer questions to the House of Representatives. H. R. Rep. No. 1579, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. The House directed the Speaker to certify the Committee's report to the United States Attorney for initiation of criminal prosecution. H. Res. 534, 83d Cong., 2d Sess.\n6\n A seven-count indictment was returned.\n7\n Petitioner waived his right to jury trial and was found guilty on all counts by the court. The sentence, a fine of $100 and one year in prison, was suspended, and petitioner was placed on probation.\n\nAn appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The conviction was reversed by a three-judge panel, one member dissenting. Upon rehearing en banc, the full bench affirmed the conviction with the judges of the original majority in dissent. 98 U.S. App. D.C. 190, 233 F.2d 681. We granted certiorari \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 187]\n\u00a0\n because of the very important questions of constitutional law presented. \n352 \nU.S. 822\n.\n\nWe start with several basic premises on which there is general agreement. The power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad. It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes. It includes surveys of defects in our social, economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy them. It comprehends probes into departments of the Federal Government to expose corruption, inefficiency or waste. But, broad as is this power of inquiry, it is not unlimited. There is no general authority to expose the private affairs of individuals without justification in terms of the functions of the Congress. This was freely conceded by the Solicitor General in his argument of this case.\n8\n Nor is the Congress a law enforcement or trial agency. These are functions of the executive and judicial departments of government. No inquiry is an end in itself; it must be related to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate task of the Congress. Investigations conducted solely for the personal aggrandizement of the investigators or to \"punish\" those investigated are indefensible.\n\nIt is unquestionably the duty of all citizens to cooperate with the Congress in its efforts to obtain the facts needed for intelligent legislative action. It is their unremitting obligation to respond to subpoenas, to respect the dignity of the Congress and its committees and to testify \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 188]\n\u00a0\n fully with respect to matters within the province of proper investigation. This, of course, assumes that the constitutional rights of witnesses will be respected by the Congress as they are in a court of justice. The Bill of Rights is applicable to investigations as to all forms of governmental action. Witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves. They cannot be subjected to unreasonable search and seizure. Nor can the First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, religion, or political belief and association be abridged.\n\nThe rudiments of the power to punish for \"contempt of Congress\" come to us from the pages of English history. The origin of privileges and contempts extends back into the period of the emergence of Parliament. The establishment of a legislative body which could challenge the absolute power of the monarch is a long and bitter story. In that struggle, Parliament made broad and varied use of the contempt power. Almost from the beginning, both the House of Commons and the House of Lords claimed absolute and plenary authority over their privileges. This was an independent body of law, described by Coke as lex parliamenti.\n9\n Only Parliament could declare what those privileges were or what new privileges were occasioned, and only Parliament could judge what conduct constituted a breach of privilege.\n\nIn particular, this exclusion of lex parliamenti from the lex terrae, or law of the land, precluded judicial review of the exercise of the contempt power or the assertion of privilege. Parliament declared that no court had jurisdiction to consider such questions. In the latter part of the seventeenth century, an action for false imprisonment was brought by one Jay who had been held in contempt. The defendant, the Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, demurred that he had taken the plaintiff \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 189]\n\u00a0\n into custody for breach of privilege. The Chief Justice, Pemberton, overruled the demurrer. Summoned to the bar of the House, the Chief Justice explained that he believed that the assertion of privilege went to the merits of the action and did not preclude jurisdiction. For his audacity, the Chief Justice was dispatched to Newgate Prison.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nIt seems inevitable that the power claimed by Parliament would have been abused. Unquestionably it was. A few examples illustrate the way in which individual rights were infringed. During the seventeenth century, there was a violent upheaval, both religious and political. This was the time of the Reformation and the establishment of the Church of England. It was also the period when the Stuarts proclaimed that the royal prerogative was absolute. Ultimately there were two revolutions, one protracted and bloody, the second without bloodshed. Critical commentary of all kinds was treated as contempt of Parliament in these troubled days. Even clergymen were imprisoned for remarks made in their sermons.\n11\n Perhaps the outstanding case arose from the private conversation of one Floyd, a Catholic, in which he expressed pleasure over the misfortune of the King's Protestant son-in-law and his wife. Floyd was not a member of Parliament. None of the persons concerned was in any way connected with the House of Commons. Nevertheless, that body imposed an humiliating and cruel sentence upon Floyd for contempt.\n12\n The House of Lords intervened, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 190]\n\u00a0\n rebuking the Commons for their extension of the privilege. The Commons acceded and transferred the record of the case to the Lords, who imposed substantially the same penalty.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nLater in that century, during the reign of Charles II, there was great unrest over the fact that the heir apparent, James, had embraced Catholicism. Anti-Catholic feeling ran high, spilling over a few years later when the infamous rogue, Titus Oates, inflamed the country with rumors of a \"Popish Plot\" to murder the King. A committee of Parliament was appointed to learn the sources of certain pamphlets that had been appearing. One was entitled: The Grand Question Concerning the Prorogation of this Parliament for a Year and Three Months Stated and Discussed. A Doctor Carey admitted to the committee that he knew the author, but refused to divulge his name. Brought to the bar of the House of Lords, he persisted in this stand. The House imposed a fine of  1,000 and committed the witness to the Tower.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nA hundred years later, George III had managed to gain control of Parliament through his ministers. The King could not silence the opposition, however, and one of the most vocal was John Wilkes. This precipitated a \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 191]\n\u00a0\n struggle that lasted for several years until Wilkes finally prevailed. One writer sums up the case thus:\n\n\"He had won a victory for freedom of the press. He had directed popular attention to the royally-controlled House of Commons, and pointed out its unrepresentative character, and had shown how easily a claim of privilege might be used to sanction the arbitrary proceedings of ministers and Parliament, even when a fundamental right of the subject was concerned. It was one of life's little ironies that work of such magnitude had been reserved for one of the worst libertines and demagogues of all time.\"\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\n Even as late as 1835, the House of Commons appointed a select committee to inquire into \". . . the origin, nature, extent and tendency of the Orange Institutions.\" This was a political-religious organization, vehemently Protestant in religion and strongly in favor of the growth of the British Empire. The committee summoned the Deputy Grand Secretary and demanded that he produce all the records of the organization. The witness refused to turn over a letter-book, which he admitted contained his answers to many communications upon Orange business. But it also contained, he said, records of private communications with respect to Orangeism. Summoned to the bar of the House of Commons, he remained adamant and was committed to Newgate Prison.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nModern times have seen a remarkable restraint in the use by Parliament of its contempt power. Important investigations, like those conducted in America by congressional committees, are made by Royal Commissions \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 192]\n\u00a0\n of Inquiry.\n17\n These commissions are comprised of experts in the problem to be studied. They are removed from the turbulent forces of politics and partisan considerations. Seldom, if ever, have these commissions been given the authority to compel the testimony of witnesses or the production of documents.\n18\n Their success in fulfilling their fact-finding missions without resort to coercive tactics is a tribute to the fairness of the processes to the witnesses and their close adherence to the subject matter committed to them.\n\nThe history of contempt of the legislature in this country is notably different from that of England. In the early days of the United States, there lingered the direct knowledge of the evil effects of absolute power. Most of the instances of use of compulsory process by the first Congresses concerned matters affecting the qualification or integrity of their members or came about in inquiries dealing with suspected corruption or mismanagement of government officials.\n19\n Unlike the English practice, from the very outset the use of contempt power by the legislature was deemed subject to judicial review.\n20\n\u00a0\n\nThere was very little use of the power of compulsory process in early years to enable the Congress to obtain facts pertinent to the enactment of new statutes or the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 193]\n\u00a0\n administration of existing laws. The first occasion for such an investigation arose in 1827 when the House of Representatives was considering a revision of the tariff laws.\n21\n In the Senate, there was no use of a fact-finding investigation in aid of legislation until 1859.\n22\n In the Legislative Reorganization Act, the Committee on Un-American Activities was the only standing committee of the House of Representatives that was given the power to compel disclosures.\n23\n\u00a0\n\nIt is not surprising, from the fact that the Houses of Congress so sparingly employed the power to conduct investigations, that there have been few cases requiring judicial review of the power. The Nation was almost one hundred years old before the first case reached this Court to challenge the use of compulsory process as a legislative device, rather than in inquiries concerning the elections \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 194]\n\u00a0\n or privileges of Congressmen.\n24\n In Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168\n, decided in 1881, an investigation had been authorized by the House of Representatives to learn the circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy of Jay Cooke & Company, in which the United States had deposited funds. The committee became particularly interested in a private real estate pool that was a part of the financial structure. The Court found that the subject matter of the inquiry was \"in its nature clearly judicial and therefore one in respect to which no valid legislation could be enacted.\" The House had thereby exceeded the limits of its own authority.\n\nSubsequent to the decision in Kilbourn, until recent times, there were very few cases dealing with the investigative power.\n25\n The matter came to the fore again when the Senate undertook to study the corruption in the handling of oil leases in the 1920's. In McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135\n, and Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263\n, the Court applied the precepts of Kilbourn to uphold the authority of the Congress to conduct the challenged investigations. The Court recognized the danger to effective and honest conduct of the Government \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 195]\n\u00a0\n if the legislature's power to probe corruption in the executive branch were unduly hampered.\n\nFollowing these important decisions, there was another lull in judicial review of investigations. The absence of challenge, however, was not indicative of the absence of inquiries. To the contrary, there was vigorous use of the investigative process by a Congress bent upon harnessing and directing the vast economic and social forces of the times. Only one case came before this Court, and the authority of the Congress was affirmed.\n26\n\u00a0\n\nIn the decade following World War II, there appeared a new kind of congressional inquiry unknown in prior periods of American history. Principally this was the result of the various investigations into the threat of subversion of the United States Government, but other subjects of congressional interest also contributed to the changed scene. This new phase of legislative inquiry involved a broad-scale intrusion into the lives and affairs of private citizens. It brought before the courts novel questions of the appropriate limits of congressional inquiry. Prior cases, like Kilbourn, McGrain and Sinclair, had defined the scope of investigative power in terms of the inherent limitations of the sources of that power. In the more recent cases, the emphasis shifted to problems of accommodating the interest of the Government with the rights and privileges of individuals. The central theme was the application of the Bill of Rights as a restraint upon the assertion of governmental power in this form.\n\nIt was during this period that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was frequently invoked \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 196]\n\u00a0\n and recognized as a legal limit upon the authority of a committee to require that a witness answer its questions.\n27\n Some early doubts as to the applicability of that privilege before a legislative committee never matured.\n28\n When the matter reached this Court, the Government did not challenge in any way that the Fifth Amendment protection was available to the witness, and such a challenge could not have prevailed. It confined its argument to the character of the answers sought and to the adequacy of the claim of privilege. Quinn v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 155\n; Emspak v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 190\n; Bart v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 219\n.\n29\n\u00a0\n\nA far more difficult task evolved from the claim by witnesses that the committees' interrogations were infringements upon the freedoms of the First Amendment.\n30\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 197]\n\u00a0\n Clearly, an investigation is subject to the command that the Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or press or assembly. While it is true that there is no statute to be reviewed, and that an investigation is not a law, nevertheless an investigation is part of lawmaking. It is justified solely as an adjunct to the legislative process. The First Amendment may be invoked against infringement of the protected freedoms by law or by lawmaking.\n31\n\u00a0\n\nAbuses of the investigative process may imperceptibly lead to abridgment of protected freedoms. The mere summoning of a witness and compelling him to testify, against his will, about his beliefs, expressions or associations is a measure of governmental interference. And when those forced revelations concern matters that are unorthodox, unpopular, or even hateful to the general public, the reaction in the life of the witness may be disastrous. This effect is even more harsh when it is past beliefs, expressions or associations that are disclosed and judged by current standards rather than those contemporary with the matters exposed. Nor does the witness alone suffer the consequences. Those who are identified by witnesses and thereby placed in the same glare of publicity are equally subject to public stigma, scorn and obloquy. Beyond that, there is the more subtle and immeasurable effect upon those who tend to adhere to \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 198]\n\u00a0\n the most orthodox and uncontroversial views and associations in order to avoid a similar fate at some future time. That this impact is partly the result of non-governmental activity by private persons cannot relieve the investigators of their responsibility for initiating the reaction.\n\nThe Court recognized the restraints of the Bill of Rights upon congressional investigations in United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n. The magnitude and complexity of the problem of applying the First Amendment to that case led the Court to construe narrowly the resolution describing the committee's authority. It was concluded that, when First Amendment rights are threatened, the delegation of power to the committee must be clearly revealed in its charter.\n\nAccommodation of the congressional need for particular information with the individual and personal interest in privacy is an arduous and delicate task for any court. We do not underestimate the difficulties that would attend such an undertaking. It is manifest that despite the adverse effects which follow upon compelled disclosure of private matters, not all such inquiries are barred. Kilbourn v. Thompson teaches that such an investigation into individual affairs is invalid if unrelated to any legislative purpose. That is beyond the powers conferred upon the Congress in the Constitution. United States v. Rumely makes it plain that the mere semblance of legislative purpose would not justify an inquiry in the face of the Bill of Rights. The critical element is the existence of, and the weight to be ascribed to, the interest of the Congress in demanding disclosures from an unwilling witness. We cannot simply assume, however, that every congressional investigation is justified by a public need that overbalances any private rights affected. To do so would be to abdicate the responsibility placed by the Constitution upon the judiciary to insure that the Congress does not unjustifiably encroach upon an individual's \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 199]\n\u00a0\n right to privacy nor abridge his liberty of speech, press, religion or assembly.\n\nPetitioner has earnestly suggested that the difficult questions of protecting these rights from infringement by legislative inquiries can be surmounted in this case because there was no public purpose served in his interrogation. His conclusion is based upon the thesis that the Subcommittee was engaged in a program of exposure for the sake of exposure. The sole purpose of the inquiry, he contends, was to bring down upon himself and others the violence of public reaction because of their past beliefs, expressions and associations. In support of this argument, petitioner has marshalled an impressive array of evidence that some Congressmen have believed that such was their duty, or part of it.\n32\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 200]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have no doubt that there is no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure. The public is, of course, entitled to be informed concerning the workings of its government.\n33\n That cannot be inflated into a general power to expose where the predominant result can only be an invasion of the private rights of individuals. But a solution to our problem is not to be found in testing the motives of committee members for this purpose. Such is not our function. Their motives alone would not vitiate an investigation which had been instituted by a House of Congress if that assembly's legislative purpose is being served.\n34\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner's contentions do point to a situation of particular significance from the standpoint of the constitutional limitations upon congressional investigations. The theory of a committee inquiry is that the committee members are serving as the representatives of the parent assembly in collecting information for a legislative purpose. Their function is to act as the eyes and ears of the Congress in obtaining facts upon which the full legislature can act. To carry out this mission, committees and subcommittees, sometimes one Congressman, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 201]\n\u00a0\n are endowed with the full power of the Congress to compel testimony. In this case, only two men exercised that authority in demanding information over petitioner's protest.\n\nAn essential premise in this situation is that the House or Senate shall have instructed the committee members on what they are to do with the power delegated to them. It is the responsibility of the Congress, in the first instance, to insure that compulsory process is used only in furtherance of a legislative purpose. That requires that the instructions to an investigating committee spell out that group's jurisdiction and purpose with sufficient particularity. Those instructions are embodied in the authorizing resolution. That document is the committee's charter. Broadly drafted and loosely worded, however, such resolutions can leave tremendous latitude to the discretion of the investigators. The more vague the committee's charter is, the greater becomes the possibility that the committee's specific actions are not in conformity with the will of the parent House of Congress.\n\nThe authorizing resolution of the Un-American Activities Committee was adopted in 1938 when a select committee, under the chairmanship of Representative Dies, was created.\n35\n Several years later, the Committee was made a standing organ of the House with the same mandate.\n36\n It defines the Committee's authority as follows:\n\n  \"The Committee on Un-American Activities, as a  whole or by subcommittee, is authorized to make  from time to time investigations of (1) the extent,  character, and objects of un-American propaganda  activities in the United States, (2) the diffusion \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 202]\n\u00a0\n  within the United States of subversive and un-American  propaganda that is instigated from foreign countries  or of a domestic origin and attacks the principle  of the form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution,  and (3) all other questions in relation  thereto that would aid Congress in any necessary  remedial legislation.\"\n37\n\u00a0\n\n\n It would be difficult to imagine a less explicit authorizing resolution. Who can define the meaning of \"un-American\"? What is that single, solitary \"principle of the form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution\"?\n38\n There is no need to dwell upon the language, however. At one time, perhaps, the resolution might have been read narrowly to confine the Committee to the subject of propaganda.\n39\n The events that have transpired in the fifteen years before the interrogation of petitioner make such a construction impossible at this date.\n\nThe members of the Committee have clearly demonstrated that they did not feel themselves restricted in any way to propaganda in the narrow sense of the word.\n40\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 203]\n\u00a0\n Unquestionably the Committee conceived of its task in the grand view of its name. Un-American activities were its target, no matter how or where manifested. Notwithstanding the broad purview of the Committee's experience, the House of Representatives repeatedly approved its continuation. Five times it extended the life of the special committee.\n41\n Then it made the group a standing committee of the House.\n42\n A year later, the Committee's charter was embodied in the Legislative Reorganization Act.\n43\n On five occasions, at the beginning of sessions of Congress, it has made the authorizing resolution part of the rules of the House.\n44\n On innumerable occasions, it has passed appropriation bills to allow the Committee to continue its efforts.\n\nCombining the language of the resolution with the construction it has been given, it is evident that the preliminary control of the Committee exercised by the House \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 204]\n\u00a0\n of Representatives is slight or non-existent. No one could reasonably deduce from the charter the kind of investigation that the Committee was directed to make. As a result, we are asked to engage in a process of retroactive rationalization. Looking backward from the events that transpired, we are asked to uphold the Committee's actions unless it appears that they were clearly not authorized by the charter. As a corollary to this inverse approach, the Government urges that we must view the matter hospitably to the power of the Congress - that if there is any legislative purpose which might have been furthered by the kind of disclosure sought, the witness must be punished for withholding it. No doubt every reasonable indulgence of legality must be accorded to the actions of a coordinate branch of our Government. But such deference cannot yield to an unnecessary and unreasonable dissipation of precious constitutional freedoms.\n\nThe Government contends that the public interest at the core of the investigations of the Un-American Activities Committee is the need by the Congress to be informed of efforts to overthrow the Government by force and violence so that adequate legislative safeguards can be erected. From this core, however, the Committee can radiate outward infinitely to any topic thought to be related in some way to armed insurrection. The outer reaches of this domain are known only by the content of \"un-American activities.\" Remoteness of subject can be aggravated by a probe for a depth of detail even farther removed from any basis of legislative action. A third dimension is added when the investigators turn their attention to the past to collect minutiae on remote topics, on the hypothesis that the past may reflect upon the present.\n\nThe consequences that flow from this situation are manifold. In the first place, a reviewing court is unable \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 205]\n\u00a0\n to make the kind of judgment made by the Court in United States v. Rumely, supra. The Committee is allowed, in essence, to define its own authority, to choose the direction and focus of its activities. In deciding what to do with the power that has been conferred upon them, members of the Committee may act pursuant to motives that seem to them to be the highest. Their decisions, nevertheless, can lead to ruthless exposure of private lives in order to gather data that is neither desired by the Congress nor useful to it. Yet it is impossible in this circumstance, with constitutional freedoms in jeopardy, to declare that the Committee has ranged beyond the area committed to it by its parent assembly because the boundaries are so nebulous.\n\nMore important and more fundamental than that, however, it insulates the House that has authorized the investigation from the witnesses who are subjected to the sanctions of compulsory process. There is a wide gulf between the responsibility for the use of investigative power and the actual exercise of that power. This is an especially vital consideration in assuring respect for constitutional liberties. Protected freedoms should not be placed in danger in the absence of a clear determination by the House or the Senate that a particular inquiry is justified by a specific legislative need.\n\nIt is, of course, not the function of this Court to prescribe rigid rules for the Congress to follow in drafting resolutions establishing investigating committees. That is a matter peculiarly within the realm of the legislature, and its decisions will be accepted by the courts up to the point where their own duty to enforce the constitutionally protected rights of individuals is affected. An excessively broad charter, like that of the House Un-American Activities Committee, places the courts in an untenable position if they are to strike a balance between the public need for a particular interrogation and the right of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 206]\n\u00a0\n citizens to carry on their affairs free from unnecessary governmental interference. It is impossible in such a situation to ascertain whether any legislative purpose justifies the disclosures sought and, if so, the importance of that information to the Congress in furtherance of its legislative function. The reason no court can make this critical judgment is that the House of Representatives itself has never made it. Only the legislative assembly initiating an investigation can assay the relative necessity of specific disclosures.\n\nAbsence of the qualitative consideration of petitioner's questioning by the House of Representatives aggravates a serious problem, revealed in this case, in the relationship of congressional investigating committees and the witnesses who appear before them. Plainly these committees are restricted to the missions delegated to them, i. e., to acquire certain data to be used by the House or the Senate in coping with a problem that falls within its legislative sphere. No witness can be compelled to make disclosures on matters outside that area. This is a jurisdictional concept of pertinency drawn from the nature of a congressional committee's source of authority. It is not wholly different from nor unrelated to the element of pertinency embodied in the criminal statute under which petitioner was prosecuted. When the definition of jurisdictional pertinency is as uncertain and wavering as in the case of the Un-American Activities Committee, it becomes extremely difficult for the Committee to limit its inquiries to statutory pertinency.\n\nSince World War II, the Congress has practically abandoned its original practice of utilizing the coercive sanction of contempt proceedings at the bar of the House. The sanction there imposed is imprisonment by the House until the recalcitrant witness agrees to testify or disclose the matters sought, provided that the incarceration does \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 207]\n\u00a0\n not extend beyond adjournment. The Congress has instead invoked the aid of the federal judicial system in protecting itself against contumacious conduct. It has become customary to refer these matters to the United States Attorneys for prosecution under criminal law.\n\nThe appropriate statute is found in 2 U.S.C. 192. It provides:\n\n  \"Every person who having been summoned as a  witness by the authority of either House of Congress  to give testimony or to produce papers upon  any matter under inquiry before either House, or  any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent  resolution of the two Houses of Congress, or any  committee of either House of Congress, willfully  makes default, or who, having appeared, refuses to  answer any question pertinent to the question under  inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,  punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 nor less  than $100 and imprisonment in a common jail for not  less than one month nor more than twelve months.\"\n45\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 208]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In fulfillment of their obligation under this statute, the courts must accord to the defendants every right which is guaranteed to defendants in all other criminal cases. Among these is the right to have available, through a sufficiently precise statute, information revealing the standard of criminality before the commission of the alleged offense.\n46\n Applied to persons prosecuted under 192, this raises a special problem in that the statute defines the crime as refusal to answer \"any question pertinent to the question under inquiry.\" Part of the standard of criminality, therefore, is the pertinency of the questions propounded to the witness.\n47\n\u00a0\n\nThe problem attains proportion when viewed from the standpoint of the witness who appears before a congressional committee. He must decide at the time the questions are propounded whether or not to answer. As the Court said in Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263\n, the witness acts at his peril. He is \". . . bound rightly to construe the statute.\" Id., at 299. An erroneous determination on his part, even if made in the utmost good faith, does not exculpate him if the court should later rule that the questions were pertinent to the question under inquiry.\n\nIt is obvious that a person compelled to make this choice is entitled to have knowledge of the subject to \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 209]\n\u00a0\n which the interrogation is deemed pertinent. That knowledge must be available with the same degree of explicitness and clarity that the Due Process Clause requires in the expression of any element of a criminal offense. The \"vice of vagueness\"\n48\n must be avoided here as in all other crimes. There are several sources that can outline the \"question under inquiry\" in such a way that the rules against vagueness are satisfied. The authorizing resolution, the remarks of the chairman or members of the committee, or even the nature of the proceedings themselves, might sometimes make the topic clear. This case demonstrates, however, that these sources often leave the matter in grave doubt.\n\nThe first possibility is that the authorizing resolution itself will so clearly declare the \"question under inquiry\" that a witness can understand the pertinency of questions asked him. The Government does not contend that the authorizing resolution of the Un-American Activities Committee could serve such a purpose. Its confusing breadth is amply illustrated by the innumerable and diverse questions into which the Committee has inquired under this charter since 1938. If the \"question under inquiry\" were stated with such sweeping and uncertain scope, we doubt that it would withstand an attack on the ground of vagueness.\n\nThat issue is not before us, however, in light of the Government's position that the immediate subject under inquiry before the Subcommittee interviewing petitioner was only one aspect of the Committee's authority to investigate un-American activities. Distilling that single topic from the broad field is an extremely difficult task upon the record before us. There was an opening statement by the Committee Chairman at the outset of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 210]\n\u00a0\n hearing, but this gives us no guidance. In this statement, the Chairman did no more than paraphrase the authorizing resolution and give a very general sketch of the past efforts of the Committee.\n49\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo aid is given as to the \"question under inquiry\" in the action of the full Committee that authorized the creation of the Subcommittee before which petitioner appeared. The Committee adopted a formal resolution giving the Chairman the power to appoint subcommittees \". . . for the purpose of performing any and all acts which the Committee as a whole is authorized to do.\"\n50\n In effect, this was a device to enable the investigations to proceed with a quorum of one or two members and \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 212]\n\u00a0\n sheds no light on the relevancy of the questions asked of petitioner.\n51\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government believes that the topic of inquiry before the Subcommittee concerned Communist infiltration in labor. In his introductory remarks, the Chairman made reference to a bill, then pending before the Committee,\n52\n which would have penalized labor unions controlled or dominated by persons who were, or had been, members of a \"Communist-action\" organization, as defined \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 213]\n\u00a0\n in the Internal Security Act of 1950. The Subcommittee, it is contended, might have been endeavoring to determine the extent of such a problem.\n\nThis view is corroborated somewhat by the witnesses who preceded and followed petitioner before the Subcommittee. Looking at the entire hearings, however, there is strong reason to doubt that the subject revolved about labor matters. The published transcript is entitled: Investigation of Communist Activities in the Chicago Area, and six of the nine witnesses had no connection with labor at all.\n53\n\u00a0\n\nThe most serious doubts as to the Subcommittee's \"question under inquiry,\" however, stem from the precise questions that petitioner has been charged with refusing to answer. Under the terms of the statute, after all, it is these which must be proved pertinent. Petitioner is charged with refusing to tell the Subcommittee whether or not he knew that certain named persons had been members of the Communist Party in the past. The Subcommittee's counsel read the list from the testimony of a previous witness who had identified them as Communists. Although this former witness was identified with labor, he had not stated that the persons he named were involved in union affairs. Of the thirty names propounded to petitioner, seven were completely unconnected with organized labor. One operated a beauty parlor. Another was a watchmaker. Several were identified as \"just citizens\" or \"only Communists.\" When \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 214]\n\u00a0\n almost a quarter of the persons on the list are not labor people, the inference becomes strong that the subject before the Subcommittee was not defined in terms of Communism in labor.\n\nThe final source of evidence as to the \"question under inquiry\" is the Chairman's response when petitioner objected to the questions on the grounds of lack of pertinency. The Chairman then announced that the Subcommittee was investigating \"subversion and subversive propaganda.\"\n54\n This is a subject at least as broad and indefinite as the authorizing resolution of the Committee, if not more so.\n\nHaving exhausted the several possible indicia of the \"question under inquiry,\" we remain unenlightened as to the subject to which the questions asked petitioner were pertinent. Certainly, if the point is that obscure after trial and appeal, it was not adequately revealed to petitioner when he had to decide at his peril whether or not to answer. Fundamental fairness demands that no witness be compelled to make such a determination with so little guidance. Unless the subject matter has been made to appear with undisputable clarity, it is the duty of the investigative body, upon objection of the witness on grounds of pertinency, to state for the record the subject \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 215]\n\u00a0\n under inquiry at that time and the manner in which the propounded questions are pertinent thereto.\n55\n To be meaningful, the explanation must describe what the topic under inquiry is and the connective reasoning whereby the precise questions asked relate to it.\n\nThe statement of the Committee Chairman in this case, in response to petitioner's protest, was woefully inadequate to convey sufficient information as to the pertinency of the questions to the subject under inquiry. Petitioner was thus not accorded a fair opportunity to determine whether he was within his rights in refusing to answer, and his conviction is necessarily invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nWe are mindful of the complexities of modern government and the ample scope that must be left to the Congress as the sole constitutional depository of legislative power. Equally mindful are we of the indispensable function, in the exercise of that power, of congressional investigations. The conclusions we have reached in this case will not prevent the Congress, through its committees, from obtaining any information it needs for the proper fulfillment of its role in our scheme of government. The legislature is free to determine the kinds of data that should be collected. It is only those investigations that are conducted by use of compulsory process that give rise to a need to protect the rights of individuals against illegal encroachment. That protection can be readily achieved through procedures which prevent the separation of power from responsibility and which provide the constitutional requisites of fairness for witnesses. A measure of added care on the part of the House and the Senate in authorizing the use of compulsory process and by their committees in exercising that power would suffice. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 216]\n\u00a0\n That is a small price to pay if it serves to uphold the principles of limited, constitutional government without constricting the power of the Congress to inform itself.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the indictment.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON and MR.

There was no debate other than a statement by Representative Javits on a proposal to consolidate the legislative bodies investigating subversion. 100 Cong. Rec. 6382-6386. The resolution to prosecute petitioner passed by a voice vote. There was lengthier discussion and a recorded vote on the first case considered by the House. Id., at 6375-6382. In none of the cases was there any debate on the merits of the witnesses' conduct. Id., at 6375-6401.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The counts of the indictment were patterned from the sequence of the questioning by the Committee. Petitioner was asked separately about six persons, and these are the basis of the first six counts. The last count comprises the omnibus question that gave a list of twenty-five names for petitioner to identify. With two exceptions, the questions asked for knowledge of past membership in the Communist Party. The context of the interrogation indicates that the Committee's concern was with such past conduct. Petitioner agreed to and did disclose his knowledge of those he believed to be present members.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] \"Now, we don't claim on behalf of the Government that there is any right to expose for the purposes of exposure.

The power of the House to authorize a fact-finding inquiry in aid of legislation was seriously challenged. After full debate the investigation was authorized by a vote of 102 to 88. 4 Cong. Deb. 889.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] The subject matter of the select committee was \". . . the late invasion and seizure of the armory and arsenal of the United States at Harper's Ferry, in Virginia, by a band of armed men . . . .

The case arose out of the inquiry by the Common Council of New York into the conduct of the Police Department in 1855. Judge Charles Patrick Daly upheld the investigative power as implicit in the functions of a legislature, but ruled that the examination of witnesses must be confined to the subject under investigation. Applying this standard, he ruled that questions directed to the national origin of policemen were improper under the investigators' authorizing resolution. Briggs v. Mackeller, 2 Abbott's Practice Reports 30 (N. Y. Common Pleas 1855).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] In re Chapman, \n166 \nU.S. 661\n (upheld conviction under R.

MacCracken, \n294 \nU.S. 125\n (upheld power of Senate to punish as a contempt the action of a witness in allowing the destruction and removal of papers subject to the subpoena of a Senate committee; held that enactment of 2 U.S.C. 192 did not impair contempt power of Houses of Congress).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] The first reported case in which the claim of the privilege against self-incrimination was allowed in a congressional inquiry proceeding was United States v. Yukio Abe, 95 F. Supp. 991. Prior thereto, several state courts had held that legislative investigations were subject to the witness' privilege not to accuse himself under state constitutions. Emery's Case, 107 Mass. 172, decided in 1871 is the earliest. See also Ex parte Johnson, 187 S. C. 1, 196 S.

See, e. g., Starkovich v. United States, 231 F.2d 411; Aiuppa v. United States, 201 F.2d 287; United States v. Costello, 198 F.2d 200; Marcello v. United States, 196 F.2d 437; United States v.

Subpoenas duces tecum had been issued calling for the correspondence and other records of these organizations. Refusals to comply were followed by prosecutions under 2 U.S.C. 192. The District Court denied motions to dismiss the indictments in United States v. Bryan, 72 F. Supp. 58. The decision with respect to the First Amendment was affirmed in Barsky v. United States, 167 F.2d 241.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] See United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41, 43\n-44; Lawson v. United States, 176 F.2d 49, 51-52; Barsky v.

No. 1476, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 1-2. A pamphlet issued by the Committee in 1951 stated that: \"Exposure in a systematic way began with the formation of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, May 26, 1938.\" The Committee believed itself commanded \". . . to expose people and organizations attempting to destroy this country. That is still its job and to that job it sticks.\" 100 Things You Should Know About Communism, H. R. Doc. No. 136, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 19, 67. In its annual reports, the Committee has devoted a large part of its information to a public listing of names along with a summary of their activities. \". . . [T]he committee feels that the Congress and the American people will have a much clearer and fuller picture of the success and scope of communism in the United States by having set forth the names and, where possible, the positions occupied by individuals who have been identified as Communists, or former Communists, during the past year.\" H. R. Rep. No. 2516, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 6-7.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] We are not concerned with the power of the Congress to inquire into and publicize corruption, maladministration or inefficiency in agencies of the Government. That was the only kind of activity described by Woodrow Wilson in Congressional Government when he wrote: \"The informing function of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative function.\" Id., at 303. From the earliest times in its history, the Congress has assiduously performed an \"informing function\" of this nature.

Such imprisonment is valid only so long as the House remains in session. See Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231; Eberling, Congressional Investigations, 180-184. The immediate cause for adoption of the statute was an accusation by one J. W. Simonton, a newspaperman, that certain unnamed Congressmen were soliciting bribes on a matter pending before the legislature. Simonton was cited before the House of Representatives and refused to divulge the names of those implicated. In the course of that episode, the forerunner of 2 U.S.C. 192 was passed in order \". . . to inflict a greater punishment than the committee believe the House possesses the power to inflict.\" Cong.

I should like to make an opening statement regarding our work here in the city of Chicago. The Congress of the United States, realizing that there are individuals and elements in this country whose aim it is to subvert our constitutional form of government, has established the House Committee on Un-American Activities. In establishing this committee, the Congress has directed that we must investigate and hold hearings, either by the full committee or by a subcommittee, to ascertain the extent and success of subversive activities directed against these United States. \"On the basis of these investigations and hearings, the Committee on Un-American Activities reports its findings to the Congress and makes recommendations from these investigations and hearings for new legislation. As a result of this committee's investigations and hearings, the Internal Security Act of 1950 was enacted. \"Over the past fifteen years this committee has been in existence, both as a special and permanent committee, it has made forty-seven recommendations to the Congress to insure proper security against subversion. I am proud to be able to state that of these forty-seven recommendations, all but eight have been acted upon in one way or another. Among these recommendations which the Congress has not acted upon are those which provide that witnesses appearing before congressional committees be granted immunity from prosecution on the information they furnish. \"The committee has also recommended that evidence secured from confidential devices be admissible in cases involving the national security. The executive branch of Government has now also asked the Congress for such legislation. A study is now being made of various bills dealing with this matter. \"The Congress has also referred to the House Committee on Un-American Activities a bill which would amend the National Security Act of 1950. This bill, if enacted into law, would provide that the Subversive Activities Control Board should, after suitable hearings and procedures, be empowered to find if certain labor organizations are in fact Communist-controlled action groups. Following this action, such labor groups would not have available the use of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 211]\n\u00a0\n National Labor Relations Board as they now have under the provisions of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947. \"During the first session of this 83rd Congress, the House Un-American Activities Committee has held hearings in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California; Albany and New York City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Columbus, Ohio. We are here in Chicago, Illinois, realizing that this is the center of the great mid-western area of the United States. \"It cannot be said that subversive infiltration has had a greater nor a lesser success in infiltrating this important area. The hearings today are the culmination of an investigation that has been conducted by the committee's competent staff and is a part of the committee's intention for holding hearings in various parts of the country. \"The committee has found that by conducting its investigations and holding hearings in various parts of the country, it has been able to secure a fuller and more comprehensive picture of subversive efforts throughout our nation. Every witness who has been subpoenaed to appear before the committee here in Chicago, as in all hearings conducted by this committee, are [sic] known to possess information which will assist the committee in performing its directed function to the Congress of the United States.\" (R. 43-44; Hearing, supra, note 2, Part 1, at 4165-4166.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 50\n] The Committee convened in executive session on January 22, 1953, and adopted the following resolution: \"BE IT RESOLVED, that the Chairman shall have authority from time to time to appoint subcommittees composed of one or more members of the Committee on Un-American Activities for the purpose of performing any and all acts which the Committee as a whole is authorized to do.\" (R. 91.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 51\n] The original resolution authorizing subcommittees was amended on March 3, 1954, to require any subcommittee to consist of at least three members, two of whom could constitute a quorum. (R. 92.) Petitioner appeared before a subcommittee composed at the outset of four members. After a recess in the course of his testimony, only two committeemen were present. It was during this latter phase of his testimony that petitioner refused to answer the questions involved in this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 52\n] The bill pending at the time of the Chairman's remarks, March 15, 1954, and when petitioner testified a month later was H. R. 7487, 100 Cong. Rec. 763. No action was ever taken on this proposal. Introduced by Representative Velde, it would have withdrawn the rights, privileges and benefits under the National Labor Relations Act of any labor organization which was substantially directed, dominated or controlled by persons who were or ever had been members of a \"Communist-action organization,\" as that phrase is used in the Internal Security Act. On July 6, 1954, after extensive hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported favorably on S. 3706, a bill drafted by that committee to amend the Internal Security Act. Two days later, Representative Velde introduced H. R. 9838, which was identical to S. 3706. These bills eventually became law. 68 Stat. 775. The Act created the concept of a \"Communist infiltrated organization,\" and part of its provisions declared that a labor union that came within that definition should be barred from the rights, privileges and benefits of the National Labor Relations Act. The same sanctions were applied to a labor group that was a \"Communist-action\" or \"Communist-front organization\" under the original Internal Security Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 53\n] The first four witnesses testified principally about the Communist Party activities of an employee of the National Cancer Institute of the United States Public Health Service. A Chicago attorney related to the Subcommittee his experiences with Communist youth organizations during his college days. The sixth witness told of her work as a district organizer for the Communist Party in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and the Dakotas during the 1930's.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 54\n] \"This committee is set up by the House of Representatives to investigate subversion and subversive propaganda and to report to the House of Representatives for the purpose of remedial legislation. \"The House of Representatives has by a very clear majority, a very large majority, directed us to engage in that type of work, and so we do, as a committee of the House of Representatives, have the authority, the jurisdiction, to ask you concerning your activities in the Communist Party, concerning your knowledge of any other persons who are members of the Communist Party or who have been members of the Communist Party, and so, Mr. Watkins, you are directed to answer the question propounded to you by counsel.\" (R. 86; Hearings, supra, note 2, Part 3, at 4275-4276.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 55\n] Cf. United States v. Kamin, 136 F. Supp. 791, 800.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nI deem it important to state what I understand to be the Court's holding. Agreeing with its holding, I join its opinion.\n\nThe power of the Congress to punish for contempt of its authority is, as the Court points out, rooted in history. It has been acknowledged by this Court since 1821. Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204. Until 1857, Congress was content to punish for contempt through its own process. By the Act of January 24, 1857, 11 Stat. 155, as amended by the Act of January 24, 1862, 12 Stat. 333, Congress provided that, \"in addition to the pains and penalties now existing\" (referring of course to the power of Congress itself to punish for contempt), \"contumacy in a witness called to testify in a matter properly under consideration by either House, and deliberately refusing to answer questions pertinent thereto, shall be a misdemeanor against the United States.\" In re Chapman, \n166 \nU.S. 661, 672\n. This legislation is now 2 U.S.C. 192. By thus making the federal judiciary the affirmative agency for enforcing the authority that underlies the congressional power to punish for contempt, Congress necessarily brings into play the specific provisions of the Constitution relating to the prosecution of offenses and those implied restrictions under which courts function. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 217]\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo turn to the immediate problem before us, the scope of inquiry that a committee is authorized to pursue must be defined with sufficiently unambiguous clarity to safeguard a witness from the hazards of vagueness in the enforcement of the criminal process against which the Due Process Clause protects. The questions must be put with relevance and definiteness sufficient to enable the witness to know whether his refusal to answer may lead to conviction for criminal contempt and to enable both the trial and the appellate courts readily to determine whether the particular circumstances justify a finding of guilt.\n\nWhile implied authority for the questioning by the Committee, sweeping as was its inquiry, may be squeezed out of the repeated acquiescence by Congress in the Committee's inquiries, the basis for determining petitioner's guilt is not thereby laid. Prosecution for contempt of Congress presupposes an adequate opportunity for the defendant to have awareness of the pertinency of the information that he has denied to Congress. And the basis of such awareness must be contemporaneous with the witness' refusal to answer and not at the trial for it. Accordingly, the actual scope of the inquiry that the Committee was authorized to conduct and the relevance of the questions to that inquiry must be shown to have been luminous at the time when asked and not left, at best, in cloudiness. The circumstances of this case were wanting in these essentials.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nAs I see it the chief fault in the majority opinion is its mischievous curbing of the informing function of the Congress. While I am not versed in its procedures, my experience in the Executive Branch of the Government leads me to believe that the requirements laid down in the opinion for the operation of the committee system of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 218]\n\u00a0\n inquiry are both unnecessary and unworkable. It is my purpose to first discuss this phase of the opinion and then record my views on the merits of Watkins' case.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIt may be that at times the House Committee on Un-American Activities has, as the Court says, \"conceived of its task in the grand view of its name.\" And, perhaps, as the Court indicates, the rules of conduct placed upon the Committee by the House admit of individual abuse and unfairness. But that is none of our affair. So long as the object of a legislative inquiry is legitimate and the questions propounded are pertinent thereto, it is not for the courts to interfere with the committee system of inquiry. To hold otherwise would be an infringement on the power given the Congress to inform itself, and thus a trespass upon the fundamental American principle of separation of powers. The majority has substituted the judiciary as the grand inquisitor and supervisor of congressional investigations. It has never been so.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nLegislative committees to inquire into facts or conditions for assurance of the public welfare or to determine the need for legislative action have grown in importance with the complexity of government. The investigation that gave rise to this prosecution is of the latter type. Since many matters requiring statutory action lie in the domain of the specialist or are unknown without testimony from informed witnesses, the need for information has brought about legislative inquiries that have used the compulsion of the subpoena to lay bare needed facts and a statute, 2 U.S.C. 192 here involved, to punish recalcitrant witnesses. The propriety of investigations has long been recognized and rarely curbed by the courts, though \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 219]\n\u00a0\n constitutional limitations on the investigatory powers are admitted.\n1\n The use of legislative committees to secure information follows the example of the people from whom our legislative system is derived. The British method has variations from that of the United States but fundamentally serves the same purpose - the enlightenment of Parliament for the better performance of its duties. There are standing committees to carry on the routine work, royal commissions to grapple with important social or economic problems, and special tribunals of inquiry for some alleged offense in government.\n2\n Our Congress has since its beginning used the committee system to inform itself. It has been estimated that over 600 investigations have been conducted since the First Congress. They are \"a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislate . . . .\" McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135, 175\n (1927).\n\nThe Court indicates that in this case the source of the trouble lies in the \"tremendous latitude\" given the Un-American Activities Committee in the Legislative Reorganization Act.\n3\n It finds that the Committee \"is \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 220]\n\u00a0\n allowed, in essence, to define its own authority, [and] to choose the direction and focus of its activities.\" This, of course, is largely true of all committees within their respective spheres. And, while it is necessary that the \"charter,\" as the opinion calls the enabling resolution, \"spell out [its] jurisdiction and purpose,\" that must necessarily be in more or less general terms. An examination of the enabling resolutions of other committees reveals the extent to which this is true.\n\nPermanent or standing committees of both Houses have been given power in exceedingly broad terms. For example, the Committees on the Armed Services have jurisdiction over \"Common defense generally\";\n4\n the Committees on Interstate and Foreign Commerce have \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 221]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction over \"Interstate and foreign commerce generally\";\n5\n and the Committees on Appropriation have jurisdiction over \"Appropriation of the revenue for the support of the Government.\"\n6\n Perhaps even more important for purposes of comparison are the broad authorizations given to select or special committees established by the Congress from time to time. Such committees have been \"authorized and directed\" to make full and complete studies \"of whether organized crime utilizes the facilities of interstate commerce or otherwise operates in interstate commerce\";\n7\n \"of . . . all lobbying activities intended to influence, encourage, promote, or retard legislation\";\n8\n \"to determine the extent to which current \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 222]\n\u00a0\n literature . . . containing immoral, [or] obscene . . . matter, or placing improper emphasis on crime . . . are being made available to the people of the United States . . .\";\n9\n and \"of the extent to which criminal or other improper practices . . . are, or have been, engaged in in the field of labor-management relations . . . to the detriment of the interests of the public . . . .\"\n10\n (Emphasis added in each example.) Surely these authorizations permit the committees even more \"tremendous latitude\" than the \"charter\" of the Un-American Activities Committee. Yet no one has suggested that the powers granted were too broad. To restrain and limit the breadth of investigative power of this Committee necessitates the similar handling of all other committees. The resulting restraint imposed on the committee system appears to cripple the system beyond workability.\n\nThe Court finds fault with the use made of compulsory process, power for the use of which is granted the Committee \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 223]\n\u00a0\n in the Reorganization Act. While the Court finds that the Congress is free \"to determine the kinds of data\" it wishes its committees to collect, this has led, the Court says, to an encroachment on individual rights through the abuse of process. To my mind this indicates a lack of understanding of the problems facing such committees. I am sure that the committees would welcome voluntary disclosure. It would simplify and relieve their burden considerably if the parties involved in investigations would come forward with a frank willingness to cooperate. But everyday experience shows this just does not happen. One needs only to read the newspapers to know that the Congress could gather little \"data\" unless its committees had, unfettered, the power of subpoena. In fact, Watkins himself could not be found for appearance at the first hearing and it was only by subpoena that he attended the second. The Court generalizes on this crucial problem saying \"added care on the part of the House and the Senate in authorizing the use of compulsory process and by their committees in exercising that power would suffice.\" It does not say how this \"added care\" could be applied in practice; however, there are many implications since the opinion warns that \"procedures which prevent the separation of power from responsibility\" would be necessary along with \"constitutional requisites of fairness for witnesses.\" The \"power\" and \"responsibility\" for the investigations are, of course, in the House where the proceeding is initiated. But the investigating job itself can only be done through the use of committees. They must have the \"power\" to force compliance with their requirements. If the rule requires that this power be retained in the full House then investigations will be so cumbrous that their conduct will be a practical impossibility. As to \"fairness for witnesses\" there is nothing in the record showing any abuse of Watkins. If anything, the Committee was abused by his recalcitrance. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 224]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile ambiguity prevents exactness (and there is \"vice in vagueness\" the majority reminds), the sweep of the opinion seems to be that \"preliminary control\" of the Committee must be exercised. The Court says a witness' protected freedoms cannot \"be placed in danger in the absence of a clear determination by the House or the Senate that a particular inquiry is justified by a specific legislative need.\" Frankly I do not see how any such procedure as \"preliminary control\" can be effected in either House of the Congress. What will be controlled preliminarily? The plans of the investigation, the necessity of calling certain witnesses, the questions to be asked, the details of subpoenas duces tecum, etc.? As it is now, Congress is hard pressed to find sufficient time to fully debate and adopt all needed legislation. The Court asserts that \"the Congress has practically abandoned its original practice of utilizing the coercive sanction of contempt proceedings at the bar of the House.\" This was to be expected. It may be that back in the twenties and thirties Congress could spare the time to conduct contempt hearings, but that appears impossible now. The Court places a greater burden in the conduct of contempt cases before the courts than it does before \"the bar of the House.\" It cites with approval cases of contempt tried before a House of the Congress where no more safeguards were present than we find here. In contempt prosecutions before a court, however, the majority places an investigative hearing on a par with a criminal trial, requiring that \"knowledge of the subject to which the interrogation is deemed pertinent . . . must be available [to the witness] with the same degree of explicitness and clarity that the Due Process Clause requires in the expression of any element of a criminal offense.\" I know of no such claim ever being made before. Such a requirement has never been thought applicable to investigations and is wholly out of place when related to the informing function \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 225]\n\u00a0\n of the Congress. See Frankfurter, Hands Off The Investigations, 38 New Republic, May 21, 1924, p. 329, 65 Cong. Rec. 9080-9082. The Congress does not have the facts at the time of the investigation for it is the facts that are being sought. In a criminal trial the investigation has been completed and all of the facts are at hand. The informing function of the Congress is in effect \"a study by the government of circumstances which seem to call for study in the public interest.\" See Black, Inside a Senate Investigation, 172 Harper's Magazine, Feb. 1936, pp. 275, 278. In the conduct of such a proceeding it is impossible to be as explicit and exact as in a criminal prosecution. If the Court is saying that its new rule does not apply to contempt cases tried before the bar of the House affected, it may well lead to trial of all contempt cases before the bar of the whole House in order to avoid the restrictions of the rule. But this will not promote the result desired by the majority. Summary treatment, at best, could be provided before the whole House because of the time factor, and such treatment would necessarily deprive the witness of many of the safeguards in the present procedures. On review here the majority might then find fault with that procedure.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nComing to the merits of Watkins' case, the Court reverses the judgment because: (1) The subject matter of the inquiry was not \"made to appear with undisputable clarity\" either through its \"charter\" or by the Chairman at the time of the hearing and, therefore, Watkins was deprived of a clear understanding of \"the manner in which the propounded questions [were] pertinent thereto\"; and (2) the present committee system of inquiry of the House, as practiced by the Un-American Activities Committee, does not provide adequate safeguards for the protection \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 226]\n\u00a0\n of the constitutional right of free speech. I subscribe to neither conclusion.\n\nWatkins had been an active leader in the labor movement for many years and had been identified by two previous witnesses at the Committee's hearing in Chicago as a member of the Communist Party. There can be no question that he was fully informed of the subject matter of the inquiry. His testimony reveals a complete knowledge and understanding of the hearings at Chicago. There the Chairman had announced that the Committee had been directed \"to ascertain the extent and success of subversive activities directed against these United States [and] On the basis of these investigation and hearings . . . [report] its findings to the Congress and [make] recommendations . . . for new legislation.\" He pointed to the various laws that had been enacted as a result of Committee recommendations. He stated that \"The Congress has also referred to the House Committee on Un-American Activities a bill which would amend the National Security Act of 1950\" which, if made law, would restrict the availability of the Labor Act to unions not \"in fact Communist-controlled action groups.\" The Chairman went on to say that \"It cannot be said that subversive infiltration has had a greater nor a lesser success in infiltrating this important area. The hearings today are the culmination of an investigation . . . . Every witness who has been subpoenaed to appear before the committee here in Chicago . . . [is] known to possess information which will assist the Committee in performing its directed function to the Congress of the United States.\"\n\nA subpoena had issued for Watkins to appear at the Chicago hearings but he was not served. After Watkins was served the hearing in question was held in Washington, D.C. Reference at this hearing was made to the one conducted in Chicago. Watkins came before the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 227]\n\u00a0\n Committee with a carefully prepared statement. He denied certain testimony of the previous witnesses and declared that he had never been a \"card-carrying member\" of the Party. He admitted that for the period 1942-1947 he \"cooperated with the Communist Party . . . participated in Communist activities . . . made contributions . . . attended caucuses at [his union's] convention at which Communist Party officials were present . . . [and] freely cooperated with the Communist Party . . . .\" This indicated that for a five-year period he, a union official, was cooperating closely with the Communist Party even permitting its officials to attend union caucuses. For the last two years of this liaison the Party had publicly thrown off its cloak of a political party. It was a reconstituted, militant group known to be dedicated to the overthrow of our Government by force and violence. In this setting the Committee attempted to have Watkins identify 30 persons, most of whom were connected with labor unions in some way. While one \"operated a beauty parlor\" and another was \"a watchmaker,\" they may well have been \"drops\" or other functionaries in the program of cooperation between the union and the Party. It is a non sequitur for the Court to say that since \"almost a quarter of the persons on the list are not labor people, the inference becomes strong that the subject before the Subcommittee was not defined in terms of Communism in labor.\" I submit that the opposite is true.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nI think the Committee here was acting entirely within its scope and that the purpose of its inquiry was set out with \"undisputable clarity.\" In the first place, the authorizing language of the Reorganization Act\n11\n must be read as a whole, not dissected. It authorized investigation \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 228]\n\u00a0\n into subversive activity, its extent, character, objects, and diffusion. While the language might have been more explicit than using such words as \"un-American,\" or phrases like \"principle of the form of government,\" still these are fairly well understood terms. We must construe them to give them meaning if we can. Our cases indicate that rather than finding fault with the use of words or phrases, we are bound to presume that the action of the legislative body in granting authority to the Committee was with a legitimate object \"if [the action] is capable of being so construed.\" (Emphasis added.) People ex rel. McDonald v. Keeler, 99 N. Y. 463, 487, 2 N. E. 615, 627-628 (1885), as quoted and approved in McGrain v. Daugherty, supra, at 178. Before we can deny the authority \"it must be obvious that\" the Committee has \"exceeded the bounds of legislative power.\" Tenney v. Brandhove, \n341 \nU.S. 367, 378\n (1951). The fact that the Committee has often been attacked has caused close scrutiny of its acts by the House as a whole and the House has repeatedly given the Committee its approval. \"Power\" and \"responsibility\" have not been separated. But the record in this case does not stop here. It shows that at the hearings involving Watkins, the Chairman made statements explaining the functions of the Committee.\n12\n And, furthermore, Watkins' action at the hearing \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 229]\n\u00a0\n clearly reveals that he was well acquainted with the purpose of the hearing. It was to investigate Communist infiltration into his union. This certainly falls within the grant of authority from the Reorganization Act and the House has had ample opportunity to limit the investigative scope of the Committee if it feels that the Committee has exceeded its legitimate bounds.\n\nThe Court makes much of petitioner's claim of \"exposure for exposure's sake\" and strikes at the purposes of the Committee through this catch phrase. But we are bound to accept as the purpose of the Committee that stated in the Reorganization Act together with the statements of the Chairman at the hearings involved here. Nothing was said of exposure. The statements of a single Congressman cannot transform the real purpose of the Committee into something not authorized by the parent resolution. See United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n (1953); Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263, 295\n (1929). The Court indicates that the questions propounded were asked for exposure's sake and had no pertinency to the inquiry. It appears to me that they were entirely pertinent to the announced purpose of the Committee's inquiry. Undoubtedly Congress has the power to inquire into the subjects of communism and the Communist Party. American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382\n (1950). As a corollary of the congressional power to inquire into such subject matter, the Congress, through its committees, can legitimately seek to identify individual members of the Party. Barsky v. United States, 83 U.S. App. D.C. 127, 167 F.2d 241 (1948), cert. denied, \n334 \nU.S. 843\n. See also Lawson v. United States, 85 U.S. App. D.C. 167, 170-171, 176 F.2d 49, 52-53 \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 230]\n\u00a0\n (1949), cert. denied, \n339 \nU.S. 934\n; United States v. Josephson, 165 F.2d 82, 90-92 (1947), cert. denied, \n333 \nU.S. 838\n.\n\nThe pertinency of the question is highlighted by the need for the Congress to know the extent of infiltration of communism in labor unions. This technique of infiltration was that used in bringing the downfall of countries formerly free but now still remaining behind the Iron Curtain. The Douds case illustrates that the Party is not an ordinary political party and has not been at least since 1945. Association with its officials is not an ordinary association. Nor does it matter that the questions related to the past. Influences of past associations often linger on as was clearly shown in the instance of the witness Matusow and others. The techniques used in the infiltration which admittedly existed here might well be used again in the future. If the parties about whom Watkins was interrogated were Communists and collaborated with him, as a prior witness indicated, an entirely new area of investigation might have been opened up. Watkins' silence prevented the Committee from learning this information which could have been vital to its future investigation. The Committee was likewise entitled to elicit testimony showing the truth or falsity of the prior testimony of the witnesses who had involved Watkins and the union with collaboration with the Party. If the testimony was untrue a false picture of the relationship between the union and the Party leaders would have resulted. For these reasons there were ample indications of the pertinency of the questions.\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\nThe Court condemns the long-established and long-recognized committee system of inquiry of the House because it raises serious questions concerning the protection it affords to constitutional rights. It concludes that compelling \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 231]\n\u00a0\n a witness to reveal his \"beliefs, expressions or associations\" impinges upon First Amendment rights. The system of inquiry, it says, must \"insure that the Congress does not unjustifiably encroach upon an individual's right to privacy nor abridge his liberty of speech, press, religion or assembly.\" In effect the Court honors Watkins' claim of a \"right to silence\" which brings all inquiries, as we know, to a \"dead end.\" I do not see how any First Amendment rights were endangered here. There is nothing in the First Amendment that provides the guarantees Watkins claims. That Amendment was designed to prevent attempts by law to curtail freedom of speech. Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 375\n (1927). It forbids Congress from making any law \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" It guarantees Watkins' right to join any organization and make any speech that does not have an intent to incite to crime. Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n (1951). But Watkins was asked whether he knew named individuals and whether they were Communists. He refused to answer on the ground that his rights were being abridged. What he was actually seeking to do was to protect his former associates, not himself, from embarrassment. He had already admitted his own involvement. He sought to vindicate the rights, if any, of his associates. It is settled that one cannot invoke the constitutional rights of another. Tileston v. Ullman, \n318 \nU.S. 44, 46\n (1943).\n\nAs already indicated, even if Watkins' associates were on the stand they could not decline to disclose their Communist connections on First Amendment grounds. While there may be no restraint by the Government of one's beliefs, the right of free belief has never been extended to include the withholding of knowledge of past events or transactions. There is no general privilege of silence. The First Amendment does not make speech or silence permissible to a person in such measure as he \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 232]\n\u00a0\n chooses. Watkins has here exercised his own choice as to when he talks, what questions he answers, and when he remains silent. A witness is not given such a choice by the Amendment. Remote and indirect disadvantages such as \"public stigma, scorn and obloquy\" may be related to the First Amendment, but they are not enough to block investigation. The Congress has recognized this since 1862 when it first adopted the contempt section, R. S. 103, as amended, 2 U.S.C. 193, declaring that no witness before a congressional committee may refuse to testify \"upon the ground that his testimony to such fact or his production of such paper may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render him infamous.\" See also McGrain v. Daugherty, supra, at 179-180; United States v. Josephson, 165 F.2d 82, 89 (1947), cert. denied, \n333 \nU.S. 838\n. See also Report on Congressional Investigations, Assn. of the Bar of the City of New York, 3-4 (1948).\n\nWe do not have in this case unauthorized, arbitrary, or unreasonable inquiries and disclosures with respect to a witness' personal and private affairs so ably and properly denounced in the Sinclair case, supra, at 291-292. This inquiry is far different from the cases relied upon by the Court. There is no analogy to the case of Richard Thompson\n13\n involving the sermons of clergymen. It is not Floyd's\n14\n case involving criticism of the royal family. There is no resemblance to John Wilkes' struggle for a seat in Parliament. It is not Briggs\n15\n where the prosecutor sought to develop the national origin of policemen. It is not Kilbourn\n16\n involving a private real estate pool. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 178, 233]\n\u00a0\n Nor is it Quinn,\n17\n Emspak,\n18\n or Bart,\n19\n involving the Fifth Amendment. It is not Rumely\n20\n involving the interpretation of a lobbying statute. Nor is this \"a new kind of congressional inquiry unknown in prior periods of American history . . . [i. e.] a broad scale intrusion into the lives and affairs of private citizens.\" As I see it only the setting is different. It involves new faces and new issues brought about by new situations which the Congress feels it is necessary to control in the public interest. The difficulties of getting information are identical if not greater. Like authority to that always used by the Congress is employed here and in the same manner so far as congressional procedures are concerned. We should afford to Congress the presumption that it takes every precaution possible to avoid unnecessary damage to reputations. Some committees have codes of procedure, and others use the executive hearing technique to this end. The record in this case shows no conduct on the part of the Un-American Activities Committee that justifies condemnation. That there may have been such occasions is not for us to consider here. Nor should we permit its past transgressions, if any, to lead to the rigid restraint of all congressional committee. To carry on its heavy responsibility the compulsion of truth that does not incriminate is not only necessary to the Congress but is permitted within the limits of the Constitution.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

CO.(1957)\nNo. 42\nArgued: December 3, 1956Decided: February 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In an action in a Federal District Court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, brought against respondent railroad by petitioner, who was injured in a fall while working as a brakeman when he slipped on a clinker in a cinder roadbed, the jury awarded damages to petitioner. The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that petitioner's evidence was insufficient to allow a jury determination of respondent's alleged negligence, and that respondent's motion for a directed verdict should have been granted. This Court granted certiorari. Held: The evidence was sufficient to go to the jury on the issue of respondent's negligence and to support a jury finding of the negligence alleged; and the judgment is reversed. Pp. 512-517.\n\n (a) The test of a jury case under the Act is whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the employee's injury. Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., ante, p. 500. Pp. 515-516.\n\n\n 228 F.2d 257, reversed.\n\nRobert J. Rafferty argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Carl L. Yaeger.\n\nHerbert J. Deany argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Joseph H. Wright, Robert S. Kirby and William F. Bunn.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act,\n1\n in which certiorari was granted to consider whether the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \n\n[352 \nU.S. 512, 513]\n\u00a0\n erred in reversing a judgment for damages awarded to the petitioner in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n2\n The ground for the reversal was that the evidence was insufficient to allow a jury determination of the respondent's alleged negligence, so that respondent's motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe petitioner, working as a brakeman on July 12, 1952, injured his kneecap in a fall on a cinder roadbed at a point some 15 feet from a house track switch at Mount Olive, Illinois. He was alongside a track connecting to the switch and slipped on an unnoticed and partially covered cinder \"about the size of [his] fist\" embedded in the level but soft roadbed.\n\nIt is conceded that the clinker in the roadbed created a hazardous condition giving rise to respondent's liability under the Act if the proofs raised a jury question of respondent's alleged negligence in causing or permitting the clinker to be there. The Court of Appeals viewed the evidence as insufficient to raise a jury question because the petitioner did not adduce proofs showing what standard procedures were followed to prevent large clinkers from being used in road ballast and in inspecting roadbeds for hazards to firm footing. We do not think that the petitioner's evidence was lacking in such proofs even if we assume, and we question, that he had that burden. On the contrary, we think there were probative facts in the evidence to justify with reason a jury finding of the negligence alleged.\n\n\"[I]n passing upon whether there is sufficient evidence to submit an issue to the jury we need look only to the evidence and reasonable inferences which tend to support \n\n[352 \nU.S. 512, 514]\n\u00a0\n the case of a litigant against whom a peremptory instruction has been given.\"\n4\n We think the jury could have found from the proofs that, 3 weeks before the mishap, respondent elevated the house switch and the connecting tracks some 5 inches, using 15 cubic yards of cinder and chat ballast. Petitioner testified without objection, based on his knowledge and experience gleaned from 27 years of railroading, that the railroad's custom and practice was to take precautions to prevent the presence of large clinkers in a railroad bed, both because \"it doesn't give good footing; and it cannot be tamped in under the ties for support.\" Moreover, the respondent's evidence supplied additional facts. The section foreman in charge of the repair work testified that he did not screen the ballast for large clinkers but merely visually inspected the ballast as it was shoveled by four laborers onto \"the pushcart\" before being taken to the site. His testimony was that the largest cinder he saw would be \"say two inches in diameter. . . . Of course, I have no way of knowing exactly, but about.\" In this posture of the proofs, there is ample evidence for a jury to determine whether the procedure followed satisfied the standard to be expected from a prudent man in light of the hazard to be prevented.\n\n\n We also think that a jury question was presented by the evidence bearing on the adequacy of respondent's roadbed inspection practices used to discover hazards to firm footing. As the jury might find that the clinker was in the ballast used in the repair work, so also the jury might find, from the fact that it was in the roadbed for three weeks, that inspection was not properly made. There was evidence from which it could have been found that the clinker was not discovered either by the foreman in semiweekly inspections of the location, made in part \n\n[352 \nU.S. 512, 515]\n\u00a0\n to discover and remove hazards to workmen, or by a track inspector and a track supervisor making less frequent inspections. It was for the jury to weigh the evidence and to decide whether or not the inspections satisfied respondent's duty to provide the petitioner with a safe place to work.\n\nThe Court of Appeals said: \"That defendant placed the clinker in its roadbed as a part of the ballast used in the repair operation is merely one of several possibilities present. A finding that it did so can rest on nothing but speculation.\"\n5\n In this connection the Court of Appeals mentioned two other possible sources of the clinker. One was the L. & N. Railroad, whose main line and house tracks immediately adjoined and were connected to the respondent's house switch by a cross-over track. Another was that some stranger may have brought the clinker onto respondent's unfenced right-of-way. That there were other possible sources of the clinker would not, of course, justify a directed verdict in light of our conclusion that the evidence supports with reason a jury finding that the respondent negligently caused the clinker to be in the ballast used in the repair work and failed to use proper care to discover and remove it.\n6\n Indeed, we do not think that the evidence would reasonably support a finding that the clinker came from another source.\n\nAlthough we do not think that the case presents an issue of causation, if the quoted language of the Court \n\n[352 \nU.S. 512, 516]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals is read as holding that a jury finding could not reasonably be made that respondent's negligence \"in whole or in part\" caused the petitioner's injury, then what we said in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., ante, p. 500, at 505-507, also decided today, is pertinent:\n\n \". . . But that would mean that there is no jury question in actions under this statute, although the employee's proofs support with reason a verdict in his favor, unless the judge can say that the jury may exclude the idea that his injury was due to causes with which the defendant was not connected, or, stated another way, unless his proofs are so strong that the jury, on grounds of probability, may exclude a conclusion favorable to the defendant. That is not the governing principle defining the proof which requires a submission to the jury in these cases. . . .\n\n\n \"Under this statute the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought. It does not matter that, from the evidence, the jury may also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute the result to other causes, including the employee's contributory negligence. Judicial appraisal of the proofs to determine whether a jury question is presented is narrowly limited to the single inquiry whether, with reason, the conclusion may be drawn that negligence of the employer played any part at all in the injury or death. Judges are to fix their sights primarily to make that appraisal and, if that test is met, are bound to find that a case for the jury is made out whether or not the evidence allows the jury a choice of other probabilities.\" \n\n[352 \nU.S. 512, 517]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n We have considered the remaining questions, not passed upon by the Court of Appeals, and find them to be unsubstantial. Accordingly, we remand the case for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON concurs in the result.\n\nMR. JUSTICE REED would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n[For dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, see post, p. 524.]\n\n[For opinion of MR.

Held: As applied to a Georgia corporation which solicits orders in the Alabama City, transmits them to Georgia, where they are accepted, and delivers groceries to customers in the Alabama City, the tax is invalid under the Commerce Clause.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a suit to recover taxes paid by the appellant to the City of Opelika, Alabama, on the ground that the taxes in question imposed a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce. The state court sustained a demurrer to the complaint, 38 Ala. App. 444, 87 So.2d 661, rejecting the appellant's federal contention, and we noted probable jurisdiction. \n352 \nU.S. 924\n.\n\nSection 130 (a) of Ordinance No. 101-53 of the City of Opelika, as amended by Ordinance No. 103-53, provides that an annual privilege tax of $250 must be paid by any firm engaged in the wholesale grocery business which \n\n[354 \nU.S. 390, 391]\n\u00a0\n delivers, at wholesale, groceries in the City from points without the City.\n1\n Appellant is a Georgia corporation engaged in the wholesale grocery business in West Point, Georgia. It solicits business in the City of Opelika through salesmen; orders are transmitted to appellant's place of business in Georgia, where they are accepted and the groceries thereupon loaded on trucks and delivered to the City. Appellant has no place of business, office, or inventory in Opelika, its only contact with that City being the solicitation of orders and the delivery of goods.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nWe held in Nippert v. City of Richmond, \n327 \nU.S. 416\n, and in Memphis Steam Laundry Cleaner, Inc. v. Stone, \n342 \nU.S. 389\n, that a municipality may not impose a flatsum privilege tax on an interstate enterprise whose only contact with the municipality is the solicitation of orders and the subsequent delivery of goods at the end of an uninterrupted movement in interstate commerce, such a tax having a substantial exclusory effect on interstate commerce. In our opinion the tax here in question falls squarely within the ban of those cases. This is particularly so in that Opelika places no comparable flatsum tax on local merchants. Wholesale grocers whose deliveries originate in Opelika, instead of paying $250 annually, are taxed a sum graduated according to their gross receipts. Such an Opelika wholesaler would have to gross the sum of $280,000 in sales in one year before \n\n[354 \nU.S. 390, 392]\n\u00a0\n his tax would reach the flat $250 amount imposed on all foreign grocers before they may set foot in the City.\n3\n The Commerce Clause forbids any such discrimination against the free flow of trade over state boundaries.\n\nSince the present tax cannot constitutionally be applied to the appellant, the judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK dissents.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The ordinance provides for the following \"schedule of rates for license or privilege taxes for the conduct of any trade, vocation, profession or other business conducted within the City of Opelika\": \"Each person, firm or corporation engaged in the wholesale grocery business who unloads, delivers, distributes or disposes of groceries at wholesale in the City of Opelika, Alabama which are transported from a point without the City of Opelika, Alabama to a point within the City of Opelika, Alabama, Annual only. . . . . . . . . . . . . . $250.00.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The facts, which are admitted for purposes of the demurrer, are taken from the complaint.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 82 of the Ordinance provides for the following rates of tax on local wholesale merchants: \"Where a gross annual business is: $100,000.00 and less .............................. $35.00 Over $100,000.00 and less than $200,000.00 ........ $50.00 $200,000.00 and less than $500,000.00 ............. $75.00 $500,000.00 and less than $1,000,000.00 ........... $100.00 $1,000,000.00 and less than $2,000,000.00 ......... $200.00 $2,000,000.00 and over ............................ $250.00 \"And in addition thereto, one-sixteenth (1\/16) of one percent (1%) on the first $500,000.00 gross receipts, plus one-twentieth (1\/20) of one percent (1%) on the next $500,000.00 gross receipts plus one-fortieth (1\/40) of one percent (1%) on all gross receipts over one million dollars ($1,000,000.00).\" Thus a local wholesale grocer grossing $280,000 in one year would pay a sum of $75, plus 1\/16 of one percent of his sales, that is, $175 - a total of $250. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 390, 393]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLIAMS v.

Without passing on the merits of the complaint or a motion to dismiss it, a three-judge District Court, convened to consider the case, continued the temporary restraining order in effect for several months, pending determination of criminal proceedings against the same municipal officers.

The warrant recites that there is probable cause to believe that Voisine, Buday, Labadie, and others have conspired to obstruct justice by knowingly permitting illegal gambling to flourish in return for bribes and gratuities. A separate warrant issued, evidently on October 22d, charging Elmer Korn, also a member of the city council, with accepting bribes.\n\n Oct. 23, 1956 - Judge Bohn signed and transmitted to G.

The complaint prays: that a temporary restraining order issue to prevent defendants from continuing with the removal proceedings until other matters of relief prayed for can be determined; that a three-judge District Court be organized under 28 U.S.C. 2284, as required by 28 U.S.C. 2281, to issue a preliminary injunction; that on final hearing the removal proceedings be declared unconstitutional and void, and that a permanent injunction issue against defendants' continuing the proceedings; that the warrant and information underlying the criminal action be determined \n\n[355 \nU.S. 49, 54]\n\u00a0\n to have arisen out of unconstitutional proceedings.

Defendants agreed that temporary restraining order should remain in effect until matter disposed of by three-judge court.\n\n Jan. 21, 1957 - Defendants filed answer to complaint, denying jurisdiction of the court on the grounds, among others, that complainants had failed to exhaust their state remedies, and that the suit was in substance one to enjoin the State of Michigan from exercising its sovereign powers.\n\n Defendants filed motion to dismiss on similar grounds.\n\n\n Jan. 29, 1957 - Hearing held before three-judge District Court on motions of complainants and defendants.\n\n Feb. 1, 1957 - District Court entered amended order holding in abeyance determination of the questions submitted until the termination of complainants' criminal trials or until further order of court, and continuing in force the temporary restraining order. The court recited as grounds for its action that complainants may forthwith be tried in the criminal proceedings and the constitutional questions presented may thereby become moot, and that complainants may be prejudiced in the criminal proceedings \n\n[355 \nU.S. 49, 55]\n\u00a0\n by the investigation in the removal proceedings. Chief Judge Lederle, District Judge, dissented on the ground that the case was ripe for decision.\n\n Feb. 28, 1957 - The Governor and Attorney General filed a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order or to pass on defendants' motion to dismiss, on the ground that the court had no authority to refuse to decide the motion and to continue the temporary restraining order.\n\n Mar. 8, 1957 - Proceedings on the motion to dissolve.\n\n Mar. 11, 1957 - Voisine filed an answer to the motion to dissolve.\n\n Apr. 9, 1957 - The court entered an order denying the motion to dissolve on the ground that, deeming it a motion for a rehearing, it presented no considerations that were not before the court when it entered its amended order of February 1st. Chief Judge Lederle dissented.\n\n (5) Proceedings in This Court for Review of District  Court's Action.\n\n July 3, 1957 - The Governor and Attorney General filed in this Court a motion for leave to file a petition for writ of mandamus or for writs of prohibition and mandamus directed against the members of the three-judge District Court to compel them to decide the motion for a preliminary injunction and the motion to dismiss, or to refrain from proceeding further in the cause and to vacate the temporary restraining order.\n\n Petitioners asserted, among other grounds for the issuance of the writs, that in a case of great public importance the District Court had, for an unreasonable time, failed to perform its judicial function by granting or denying the motions before it, while continuing in effect the temporary restraining order. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 49, 56]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Oct. 24 or 25, 1957 - Counsel for Voisine filed in the District Court a motion to dismiss the complaint, noticed for hearing on November 4th. The Attorney General received a copy of this motion and on October 29th a copy of a similar motion by Labadie, also noticed for hearing on November 4th.\n\n Oct. 28, 1957 - This Court issued an order to the members of the District Court to show cause on or before November 12th why a writ of mandamus or prohibition should not issue. This order was sent to the respondents the same day, Monday, October 28th.\n\n Oct. 29, 1957 - The next day, the District Court entered an order, on the motion of Voisine and with the concurrence of the other complainants, vacating the temporary restraining order and dismissing the complaint. The Attorney General, we are advised, was not given notice that the District Court would act on the motion to dismiss, or given an opportunity to present objections.\n\n Oct. 31, 1957 - Defendants filed with the District Court an answer to the motion to dismiss, asserting that the court should refrain from acting on the motion until it had filed a return to this Court's order of October 28th to show cause.\n\n Nov. 4, 1957 - The District Court advised this Court of the order of dismissal of October 29th, and expressed its view that, since the issues presented by the case are moot, this Court should vacate its order to show cause.\n\n Nov. 8, 1957 - The Attorney General of Michigan, protesting against the District Court's action, requested a determination of the issues presented in spite of the District Court's order dismissing the complaint.\n\nFrom the foregoing it appears that as a result of the District Court's refusal to pass on the questions presented \n\n[355 \nU.S. 49, 57]\n\u00a0\n by the complainants' motion for a preliminary injunction and the defendants' motion to dismiss, together with the court's continuance of the temporary restraining order, the Governor of Michigan and subordinate state officials designated by him were prevented for almost nine months from exercising powers claimed to be conferred upon them by Michigan law to remove municipal officers guilty of misconduct. The motion for leave to file a petition for mandamus or prohibition was filed in this Court at the end of the 1956 Term and could not be considered until the commencement of the new Term. Immediately after the Court considered the motion and issued its order to show cause on the basis of a claim that challenged the validity of the actions taken by the District Court, that court dismissed the complaint and thereby derailed, as in effect it has asserted, consideration on the merits of the issues presented by the order to show cause. Putting to one side the validity or propriety of the District Court's action in relation to the order of October 28th, and accepting the dismissal as accomplished, we must deny the petition for mandamus or prohibition. By vacating the temporary restraining order and dismissing the complaint, the District Court has brought to pass one alternative of the order petitioners would have this Court issue, thus rendering the petition for all practical purposes moot. But, although the past cannot be recalled and the physical entries in the records expunged, the legal significance and implications of this case are to be deemed expunged as though the restraints imposed by the District Court had never been ordered.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 767.3 authorizes a single judge to conduct an inquiry into alleged illegal practices.

GIRARD(1957)\nNo. 1103\nArgued: July 8, 1957Decided: July 11, 1957\n\n\n\n\n The United States and Japan became involved in a controversy as to whether an American soldier should be tried by a Japanese court for causing the death of a Japanese woman in Japan. While on duty guarding a machine gun on a firing range, he fired from a grenade launcher an empty cartridge case which struck the Japanese woman, causing her death. American authorities took the position that he was acting at the time \"in performance of official duty,\" within the meaning of Paragraph 3 of Article XVII of an Administrative Agreement between the United States and Japan, as amended by a Protocol, and, therefore, the United States had the \"primary right\" to try him in a situation of concurrent jurisdiction. Japanese authorities contended that he was acting beyond the scope of official duty and that, therefore, Japan had the \"primary right\" to exercise jurisdiction. After lengthy negotiations, and with the approval of the President, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense, the United States yielded to the Japanese position, and agreed, under a provision of the amended Administrative Agreement, to waive whatever jurisdiction it might have and deliver him to Japanese authorities for trial. Japan then indicted him for causing death by wounding. He sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which denied the writ but granted declaratory relief and enjoined his delivery to Japanese authorities. This Court granted certiorari under 28 U.S.C. 1254 (1). Held: The judgment granting an injunction and declaratory relief is reversed; the judgment denying a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.

Harrington.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nJapan and the United States became involved in a controversy whether the respondent Girard should be tried by a Japanese court for causing the death of a Japanese woman. The basis for the dispute between the two Governments fully appears in the affidavit of Robert Dechert, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, an exhibit to a government motion in the court below, and the joint statement of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, printed as appendices to this opinion, post, pp. 531, 544.\n\nGirard, a Specialist Third Class in the United States Army, was engaged on January 30, 1957, with members of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 526]\n\u00a0\n his cavalry regiment in a small unit exercise at Camp Weir range area, Japan. Japanese civilians were present in the area, retrieving expended cartridge cases. Girard and another Specialist Third Class were ordered to guard a machine gun and some items of clothing that had been left nearby. Girard had a grenade launcher on his rifle. He placed an expended 30-caliber cartridge case in the grenade launcher and projected it by firing a blank. The expended cartridge case penetrated the back of a Japanese woman gathering expended cartridge cases and caused her death.\n\nThe United States ultimately notified Japan that Girard would be delivered to the Japanese authorities for trial. Thereafter, Japan indicted him for causing death by wounding. Girard sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The writ was denied, but Girard was granted declaratory relief and an injunction against his delivery to the Japanese authorities. 152 F. Supp. 21. The petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and, without awaiting action by that court on the appeal, invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under 28 U.S.C. 1254 (1). Girard filed a cross-petition for certiorari to review the denial of the writ of habeas corpus. We granted both petitions. U.S. Supreme Court Rule 20; \n354 \nU.S. 928\n.\n\nA Security Treaty between Japan and the United States, signed September 8, 1951, was ratified by the Senate on March 20, 1952, and proclaimed by the President effective April 28, 1952.\n1\n Article III of the Treaty authorized the making of Administrative Agreements between the two Governments concerning \"[t]he conditions which shall govern the disposition of armed \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 527]\n\u00a0\n forces of the United States of America in and about Japan . . . .\" Expressly acting under this provision, the two Nations, on February 28, 1952, signed an Administrative Agreement covering, among other matters, the jurisdiction of the United States over offenses committed in Japan by members of the United States armed forces, and providing that jurisdiction in any case might be waived by the United States.\n2\n This Agreement became effective on the same date as the Security Treaty (April 28, 1952) and was considered by the Senate before consent was given to the Treaty.\n\nArticle XVII, paragraph 1, of the Administrative Agreement provided that upon the coming into effect of the \"Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces,\"\n3\n signed June 19, 1951, the United States would conclude with Japan an agreement on criminal jurisdiction similar to the corresponding provisions of the NATO Agreement. The NATO Agreement became effective August 23, 1953, and the United States and Japan signed on September 29, 1953, effective October 29, 1953, a Protocol Agreement\n4\n pursuant to the covenant in paragraph 1 of Article XVII.\n\nParagraph 3 of Article XVII, as amended by the Protocol, dealt with criminal offenses in violation of the laws of both Nations and provided:\n\n \"3. In cases where the right to exercise jurisdiction is concurrent the following rules shall apply:\n\n\n \"(a) The military authorities of the United States shall have the primary right to exercise jurisdiction \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 528]\n\u00a0\n over members of the United States armed forces or the civilian component in relation to\n\n\n  \"(i) offenses solely against the property or  security of the United States, or offenses solely  against the person or property of another member  of the United States armed forces or the  civilian component or of a dependent;\n\n\n  \"(ii) offenses arising out of any act or omission  done in the performance of official duty.\n\n\n \"(b) In the case of any other offense the authorities of Japan shall have the primary right to exercise jurisdiction.\n\n\n \"(c) If the State having the primary right decides not to exercise jurisdiction, it shall notify the authorities of the other State as soon as practicable. The authorities of the State having the primary right shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from the authorities of the other State for a waiver of its right in cases where that other State considers such waiver to be of particular importance.\"\n\n\n Article XXVI of the Administrative Agreement established a Joint Committee of representatives of the United States and Japan to consult on all matters requiring mutual consultation regarding the implementation of the Agreement; and provided that if the Committee \". . . is unable to resolve any matter, it shall refer that matter to the respective Governments for further consideration through appropriate channels.\"\n\nIn the light of the Senate's ratification of the Security Treaty after consideration of the Administrative Agreement, which had already been signed, and its subsequent ratification of the NATO Agreement, with knowledge of the commitment to Japan under the Administrative Agreement, we are satisfied that the approval of Article III of the Security Treaty authorized the making of the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 529]\n\u00a0\n Administrative Agreement and the subsequent Protocol embodying the NATO Agreement provisions governing jurisdiction to try criminal offenses.\n\nThe United States claimed the right to try Girard upon the ground that his act, as certified by his commanding officer, was \"done in the performance of official duty\" and therefore the United States had primary jurisdiction. Japan insisted that it had proof that Girard's action was without the scope of his official duty and therefore that Japan had the primary right to try him.\n\nThe Joint Committee, after prolonged deliberations, was unable to agree. The issue was referred to higher authority, which authorized the United States representatives on the Joint Committee to notify the appropriate Japanese authorities, in accordance with paragraph 3 (c) of the Protocol, that the United States had decided not to exercise, but to waive, whatever jurisdiction it might have in the case. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense decided that this determination should be carried out. The President confirmed their joint conclusion.\n\nA sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders, unless it expressly or impliedly consents to surrender its jurisdiction. The Schooner Exchange v. M'Faddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136. Japan's cession to the United States of jurisdiction to try American military personnel for conduct constituting an offense against the laws of both countries was conditioned by the covenant of Article XVII, section 3, paragraph (c) of the Protocol that\n\n \". . . The authorities of the State having the primary right shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from the authorities of the other State for a waiver of its right in cases where that other State considers such waiver to be of particular importance.\" \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 530]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The issue for our decision is therefore narrowed to the question whether, upon the record before us, the Constitution or legislation subsequent to the Security Treaty prohibited the carrying out of this provision authorized by the Treaty for waiver of the qualified jurisdiction granted by Japan. We find no constitutional or statutory barrier to the provision as applied here. In the absence of such encroachments, the wisdom of the arrangement is exclusively for the determination of the Executive and Legislative Branches.\n\nThe judgment of the District Court in No. 1103 is reversed, and its judgment in No. 1108 is affirmed.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 531]\n\u00a0\n\n\n    APPENDIX A.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n\n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR   THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n\n   william s. girard   |  united states army specialist 3\/c, |     petitioner   |     vs.    > H.

CITY AND COUNTY OF PHILADELPHIA |\n\nROBERT DECHERT, being first duly sworn, deposes and says:\n\nI am the General Counsel of the Department of Defense. Personnel of my office collect, collate, and maintain files on the arrangements with regard to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction entered into between the United States and foreign countries. I have reviewed and am familiar with the various communications relating to the incident involving Specialist Third Class William S. Girard which occurred in Japan on 30 January 1957 and state, as a result of such review, and upon information and belief, that the facts surrounding that incident are as follows: \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 532]\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Situation at Camp Weir Firing Range, January 30.\n\nOn the afternoon of 30 January 1957, about 30 members of Company F, 8th Cavalry Regiment, were engaged in a small unit exercise at Camp Weir range area, Japan, involving an attack by one squad on a hill defended by another squad. Specialist 3\/C William S. Girard was in the \"attacking\" force. The Commanding Officer of the 8th Cavalry Regiment, COLONEL HERBERT A. JORDAN, states that during the morning he was appalled at the large numbers of Japanese civilian trespassers present in the area and interfering with the conduct of the exercise. He estimates that their number was in excess of 150. In one case a group of six to eight civilians pounced on a machine gun position as soon as the gun ceased firing and, before the gunner could clear his weapon, physically pushed him away from the gun in order to retrieve expended cartridge cases.\n\nThe maneuver area consists of approximately eight square miles. It is provided by the Japanese Government for part-time use of United States forces. The Japanese Defense Force uses the same area about 40% of the time. When the area is not in use by either the United States or Japanese armed forces, Japanese civilians are permitted to farm or otherwise use the area. The Japanese civilians of the local village follow the practice of scavenging the expended brass cartridge cases from the maneuver area.\n\nUpon the failure of efforts of military personnel to move the trespassers out of the danger area, Col. Jordan directed that all ball ammunition be withdrawn from the troops, and that blank ammunition be substituted in the afternoon exercise. He also directed that the Japanese police be contacted for assistance in clearing trespassers from the area, so that normal field training might be resumed. Up until the early afternoon, when the shooting incident occurred, this assistance was not forthcoming. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 533]\n\u00a0\n\n\n   The Shooting Incident.\n\n\n After one squad had attacked the hill and before the squads had changed their respective positions so that the attacking force became the defending force, and vice versa, two soldiers, Girard and Specialist 3\/C Victor N. Nickel, of the \"defending\" force, were ordered by their platoon leader, SECOND LIEUTENANT BILLY M. MAHON, who was personally directing their activities to guard a machine gun and some items of personal clothing that had been left on a nearby ridge.\n\nGIRARD in an early statement made during the course of the investigation, stated that he was ordered to get the Japanese away. He is quoted as having stated that he did not receive orders to fire at them to get them away. There is no evidence, other than the statement of Girard, that he was ordered to get the Japanese away.\n\nLIEUT. MAHON stated that he was advised that a machine gun and several field jackets had been left on the other side of Hill 655 and that he instructed Specialist 3\/C Girard and Specialist 3\/C Nickel to guard the machine gun and keep the Japanese from stealing personal equipment. There were about 20 or 30 Japanese in the area; some were near the machine gun. SPECIALIST 3\/C VICTOR N. NICKEL said the Japanese were \"just collecting the cartridges, so there was no need of chasing them away\".\n\nGirard had a grenade launcher on his rifle. He had been armed with this same weapon during the morning exercises in which he had participated and during which he had fired 80 rounds of ball ammunition. After the two soldiers had arrived on the ridge, Girard, on two occasions, placed an expended 30-caliber cartridge case in the grenade launcher and projected it by firing a blank. At his second shot, a Japanese woman, Mrs. Naka Sakai, fell. An autopsy disclosed that an expended 30-caliber cartridge case had penetrated her back in an upward \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 534]\n\u00a0\n direction to a depth of 3 1\/2-4 inches, causing her death. The exact distance between Girard and the victim at the time of the incident is uncertain. The Japanese witnesses put it about eighteen meters (approximately 20 yards). On one occasion, Girard stepped off what he thought to be the distance and found it to be 29 feet; on other occasions, he has estimated it to be 20-30 yards. Nickel puts it as 25-30 yards. Girard has stated that he did not intentionally point the rifle at the woman and did not believe the cartridge case would injure anyone if it hit them.\n\nAccording to the U.S. military authorities in Japan, the act of firing an empty shell case from a grenade launcher is not authorized.\n\nONOSAKI, a Japanese witness, stated that Girard, after enticing him and the victim toward Girard by throwing some brass on the ground and indicating that it was all right for them to pick it up, suddenly shouted for them to get out and thereupon fired one shot in the direction of Onosaki. As the victim was running away, Onosaki stated that Girard, holding his rifle at the waist, fired a second shot at the victim at a distance of about eight to ten meters. This testimony is corroborated in part by other Japanese who were located at a distance of from 100-150 meters.\n\nBoth Girard and Nickel have made a number of statements. NICKEL at first denied knowing anything about the incident. GIRARD admitted only that he had fired one round over the heads of the Japanese. Both gradually changed their testimony. NICKEL, but not Girard, admits to throwing brass on the ground. GIRARD admits that he knew his weapon, fired in the manner in which he fired it, was fairly accurate at short ranges, but denies that he knew of its striking power; he further states that he fired from the waist over the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 535]\n\u00a0\n woman's head and did not intend to hit or wound her, but only to scare the Japanese away.\n\nIn one statement, NICKEL, after admitting that he had collected a pile of empty cartridges and had on about five occasions thrown them toward the Japanese, the nearest of whom was a little over 10 yards away, has this to say: \"To tell you the truth I don't know if Girard had told you this or not, but Girard told me to throw those cartridges. The purpose was to scare the Japanese off by firing over their heads when they came to pick up the cartridges.\" After stating that about six Japanese came down to pick up the cartridges, NICKEL concludes: \"He (Girard) stood up carrying the gun, and went about two feet to my right. Japanese people started to run away, probably thinking that they were being chased. This one Mama-San also ran. Then Girard fired holding the gun at his hip . . . he held the gun at the hip and fired in the direction of the woman . . . at an angle of about 45 degrees from his body. He fired over the head of this person . . . I regard myself as a friend of Girard in my company. If I said I saw (the incident), I would be letting him down, so I lied. Then I went to Camp Drew and received various advice from an investigator there. Then I decided to tell the truth. One other reason is that Girard told the investigator that Nickel was watching.\"\n\nIn this connection, GIRARD says: \". . . while I was going toward the machine gun, I did talk to Nickel. I do not recall what I talked to him about . . . but I am positive that nothing was spoken about cartridges . . . I do not remember telling him to throw some cartridges. If I said I did not positively talk to him about it I'd be telling a lie . . . what I want to say is, as far as I can remember, I do not recall talking about it.\" GIRARD states that he has qualified as a marksman [average shot] \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 536]\n\u00a0\n and a sharpshooter [better than average shot] with the M-1 with which he was armed on the day in question, and that he twice has qualified as an expert with the .45 caliber pistol; that he has seen soldiers fire empty cartridges out of a grenade launcher on about 10 occasions; and he said, \"I did not have an exact idea how far an empty cartridge would travel, but I knew that it travelled quite a ways . . . prior to that incident I knew that the empty cartridge fired like that would travel straight forward.\"\n\nAt a later time Specialist 3\/C Nickel requested that he be permitted to make a further statement with respect to the case. Upon this occasion he stated that Girard had asked him to gather up some empty cartridge cases for the purpose of luring the Japanese people closer to their position; that he and Girard were in a foxhole together and that at Girard's request, in order to draw the Japanese closer, he, Nickel, threw empty cartridge cases from the foxhole; that Girard said, \"throw the brass a little closer\"; that Girard motioned with his hands for the brass pickers to come closer and said, \"Daijobu\", which meant for them to come closer; that Girard fired at the Japanese man, and then fired at the Japanese woman and shot her; that Girard was in a standing position and fired from the shoulder; that he (Girard) tried to get the Japanese to take the woman's body away after he shot her; and that Girard told him (Nickel) that if \"they\" asked how he held his weapon to say he fired from the waist and also to say that \"We did not throw any brass.\"\n\n The Certificate as to Official Duty\n\n\n On 7 February 1957 Girard's commanding officer filed a certificate of official duty with the local Japanese authorities. That certificate read as follows: \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 537]\n\u00a0\n\n\n    COMPANY F    8TH CAVALRY REGIMENT\n\n\n     7 February 1957\n\n\n\n\nSUBJECT:  Certificate as to Official Duty\n\n\nTHRU:  Provost Marshal    Regional Camp Whittington    APO 201\n\n\nTO:   Chief Procurator    Maebashi District    Maebashi City, Honshu, Japan\n\n\n  1. Pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 43 of the Agreed Views of the Criminal Jurisdiction Sub-committee with respect to the Protocol amending Article XVII of the Administrative Agreement between the United States and Japan, I certify that GIRARD, William S, RA 16 452 809, Specialist Third Class, Company F, 8th Cavalry Regiment, APO 201, was in the performance of his official duty at 1350 hours, 30 January 1957, Camp Weir Range Area, when he was involved in the following incident: On 30 January 1957, 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, was engaged in routine training at Camp Weir Range Area. Company F was conducting blank firing exercises. Specialist Third Class William S. GIRARD was instructed by his platoon leader to move near a position near an unguarded machine gun to guard the machine gun and items of field equipment that were in the immediate area. GIRARD, following instructions, moved to the designated position near the machine gun. While performing his duties as guard, he fired an expended cartridge case, as a warning, which struck and killed \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 538]\n\u00a0\n SAKAI, Naka, Kami-Shinden, Somamura, Gumma Prefecture, who had entered the range area for the purpose of gathering expended cartridge cases.\n\n\n 2. The United States will exercise jurisdiction in this case, unless notification is given immediately that proof to the contrary exists.\n\n\n 3. Should this incident result in trial of the above individual by general court-martial, you will be notified of the date of trial in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 45 of the above mentioned Agreed Views.\n\n\n    CARL C. ALLIGOOD     1st Lt. Infantry     Commanding\n\n\n The Japanese Notice of \"Existence of Contrary Proof\".\n\nOn 9 February 1957 the local Japanese authorities notified the United States commanding officer who had issued the certificate of official duty that they considered that proof contrary to the certificate existed. This notification stated:\n\n   MAEBASHI DISTRICT PUBLIC    PROCURATOR'S OFFICE\n\n\n    Maebashi, 9 February 1957\n\n\nTO: Mr. CARL C. ALLIGOOD,  1st Lt Infantry, Command, F Co.,  2nd Bn 8th Cavalry Regiment\n\n\nRe: Notification of the existence of the contrary   proof.\n\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\n Reference is made to the letter from you dated on 8 February 1957, regarding to the \"On Duty\" status of the case involving SP3 GIRARD S. WILLIAM, which we received on 8 February 1957. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 539]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n This is to inform you that this office considers the proof contrary thereto exists, basing upon our examinations.\n\n\n   \/s\/ Nagami Sakai     Chief Procurator     Maebashi Public Procurator's       Office\n\n\n The Japanese Statement in the Criminal Jurisdiction  Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Agreed View No. 43, on 16 February 1957 the Japanese brought the matter up in the Joint Committee and requested that it be referred to the Criminal Jurisdiction Subcommittee. On 7 March 1957 the United States representative agreed to this procedure. The matter was discussed in the Subcommittee on 12 March 1957 at which time the Japanese submitted a summary which contained the following:\n\n\"He (Girard) and Nickel went to the gun and, about 13.15 hrs he picked up and threw expended cartridge cases in the direction of the slope south of the hill, and, beckoning Hidehara Onozeki (male) and Naka Sakai (female) who had been at a place in the south-west of Hill 655 to gather empty cartridge cases, etc., cried out to them `PAPA-SAN, DAIJOBU', `MAMA-SAN, DAIJOBU' (`Old man, O.K., old lady, O.K.'), etc. in Japanese and thus let the 2 Japanese pick up expended cartridge cases he had thrown. Then he, pointing to the nearby hole for Naka Sakai, cried out to her in Japanese `MAMA - SAN, TAKUSAN - NE' (`Old lady, plenty more!'), and hinting thereby that there remained some expended cartridge cases in it, induced her to go to the hole. But, at that moment, Hideharu Onozeki who was picking up expended cartridge cases on the said slope became suspicious of the suspects behaviour and tried to run away. Then the suspect suddenly shouted to Onoseki \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 540]\n\u00a0\n `GE-ROU! HEY!' and fired a blank shot towards him, placing an expended cartridge case in the grenade launcher attached to the rifle which he had carried with him. Then he cried out `GE-ROU! HEY!' to Naka Sakai who was in the hole, and, when he saw her running off towards the north slope of the hill, he, holding the stock of the rifle under his arm, fired standing a blank shot toward her about eight (8) meters away with an expended cartridge case put in the grenade launcher, just in the same manner as he had done to Hideharu Onozeki, as the result of which he made her sustain a penetrating wound on the left side of her back which proved fatal on the spot because of the loss of blood resulting from a cut in the main artery.\"\n\n\n The Japanese conclusion was stated as follows:\n\n\"Sp-3 William S. Girard, the suspect in this case, had been instructed to guard a machine gun and equipment at the time of occurrence of the case. It is evident, however, as shown in the above finding of facts, that the incident arose when he, materially deviating from the performance of such duty of his, wilfully threw expended cartridge cases away towards Naka Sakai and Hideharu Onozeki, and, thus inviting them to come near to him, he fired towards them. Therefore, the incident is not considered to have arisen out of an act or omission done in the performance of official duty.\"\n\n\n Discussions in the Criminal Jurisdiction Subcommittee of   the Joint Committee.\n\nAt the same time the following exchange occurred:\n\nU.S.: Do you agree that Girard was on duty as a guard, and that the incident arose while he was on such duty?\n\nJapan: We admit that he was on duty, but it is our position that the shooting had no connection with his duty of guarding the machine gun. The act of Girard in \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 541]\n\u00a0\n throwing out brass and enticing the victim toward him had no connection with guarding the machine gun.\n\nU.S.: Your statement of fact does not take into account Girard's statement of his intent. That is, that he fired for the purpose of scaring the Japanese away and thus insure the safety of the machine gun.\n\nJapan: The evidence shows that there was no danger to the Machine gun. Nickel made a statement to this effect. Thus, we do not consider that Girard actually fired to protect the machine gun. The Japanese were only picking up brass in the vicinity; they were not interfering in any way with Girard's mission to guard the machine gun. There was thus no necessity or reason for Girard to shoot at them to insure the safety of the machine gun. Its safety was never in danger. Further, according to the statement of Lt. Mahon, firing an empty cartridge from a grenade launcher is not authorized, and any superior of Girard's observing such an action by Girard would have been obliged to interfere and prevent Girard from firing his weapon in this manner.\n\nU.S.: However, if we give full weight to Girard's statement, we must conclude that he did, in fact, fire to scare the Japanese away and thus insure safety of the machine gun. He may have been mistaken in believing that it was necessary to act in this manner, but we cannot escape the fact that, according to his own statement, he fired for this purpose. If you were to believe Girard's statement, would you consider that he was acting in the performance of official duty?\n\nJapan: Your question is based on a supposition that is not supported by the evidence, and we are not prepared to answer it.\n\nU.S.: In determining official duty in this case, is it not important to consider Girard's intent as disclosed by his own statement?\n\nJapan: In determining that the incident did not arise in the performance of official duty, we considered all the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 542]\n\u00a0\n evidence. A number of Japanese witnesses were interrogated immediately after the incident. We considered their testimony as well as the testimony of Girard and Nickel. In determining Girard's intent, it is necessary to consider all the evidence, not just his version of the incident. When all of the evidence is considered, it appears that Girard's statement that he fired to scare the Japanese away and thus protect the machine gun is not worthy of belief, as the weight of the evidence contradicts Girard's statement. It is our position that the evidence shows that the firing had no significant connection with the guarding of the machine gun.\n\n  Investigation of the Incident.\n\n\n Investigations of the facts relating to the alleged offense were conducted by both the U.S. Army in Japan, and the local Japanese authorities.\n\n Interpretation of \"Official Duty\".\n\n\n The following interpretation of the term \"official duty\" appears in a circular of the United States Army Forces, Far East which was published in January 1956:\n\n\"The term `official duty' as used in Article XVII, Official Minutes, and the Agreed Views is not meant to include all acts by members of the armed forces and civilian component during periods while they are on duty, but is meant to apply only to acts which are required to be done as a function of those duties which the individuals are performing. Thus, a substantial departure from the acts a person is required to perform in a particular duty usually will indicate an act outside of his `official duty.'\"\n\n  Action in the Joint Committee.\n\n\n\n As a result of lengthy discussions extending from early March to mid-May 1957, it was finally agreed in the Joint Committee that the United States military authorities \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 543]\n\u00a0\n would notify the appropriate Japanese authorities, in accordance with paragraph 3c of Article XVII of the Administrative Agreement, that the United States had decided not to exercise jurisdiction in the case. This action was thereafter taken.\n\n The Action of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary    of State.\n\nOn June 4, 1957 the Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson announced that after careful review of all available facts in the case, they had concluded that the Joint Committee's agreement that Girard be tried in the courts of Japan was reached in full accord with procedures established by the Treaty and Agreement, and that in order to preserve the integrity of the pledges of the U.S., this determination by the Joint Committee must be carried out.\n\n  Present Status of Girard.\n\n\n At the present time Specialist 3\/C Girard is administratively restricted to the limits of Camp Whittington.\n\nGirard voluntarily enlisted in the Regular Army on October 28, 1954 for a three year term which will expire on October 27, 1957.\n\n   \/s\/ ROBERT DECHERT      ROBERT DECHERT      General Counsel      Department of Defense\n\n\n Subscribed and sworn to before me this 8th day of June  1957.\n\n My commission expires: March 6, 1961.\n\n (SEAL) \/s\/ LAURA E.

WILSON\n\n\n The case of U.S. Army Specialist 3rd Class William S. Girard has far-reaching implications, involving as it does the good faith of the United States in carrying out a joint decision reached under procedures established by treaty and agreement with Japan.\n\nThe case involves actions by Girard which caused the death of Naka Sakai, a Japanese woman, on January 30, 1957. The issue arose as to whether or not Girard should be tried by U.S. court-martial or by a Japanese court. After careful deliberation in the Joint U.S.-Japan Committee established by the two Governments pursuant to treaty arrangements, the U.S. representative on this Committee was authorized to agree, and on May 16, 1957, did agree, that the United States would not exercise its asserted right of primary jurisdiction in this case. In view of this completed action, attempting to prolong the dispute over the jurisdictional issue would create a situation which could basically affect U.S. relations not only with Japan, but also with many other nations.\n\nFor these reasons, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson have carefully reviewed all the available facts in the case. They have now concluded that the Joint Committee's agreement that Girard be tried in the courts of Japan was reached in full accord with procedures established by the Treaty and Agreement, and that in order to preserve the integrity of the pledges of the United States, this determination by the Joint Committee must be carried out.\n\n.  .  .  .  . \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 545]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Secretaries' review disclosed the following:\n\nThe incident occurred in a maneuver area provided by the Japanese Government for part-time use of United States forces. The Japanese Defense Force uses the same area about 40% of the time. When the area is not in use by either the United States or Japanese armed forces, Japanese civilians are permitted to farm or otherwise use the area.\n\nEfforts to keep civilians away from the area during such military exercises have not proved effective. In this particular case, red boundary flags were, as customary, erected as a warning to civilians to keep off, and local authorities were notified of the proposed exercises. But, as was frequently the case, a number of Japanese civilians were in the area gathering empty brass cartridge cases at the time of the incident. These civilians had created such a risk of injury to themselves in the morning exercises when live ammunition was used that the American officer in charge withdrew live ammunition from the troops prior to the afternoon exercises. In the interval between two simulated attacks during the afternoon, Girard and another soldier, Specialist 3rd Class Victor M. Nickel, were ordered by their platoon leader, a Lieutenant, to guard a machine gun and several field jackets at the top of a hill. Girard and Nickel were not issued live ammunition for this duty.\n\nIt was while these soldiers were performing this duty that the incident occurred. Mrs. Naka Sakai, a Japanese civilian, died a few moments after being hit in the back by an empty brass rifle shell case fired by Girard from his rifle grenade launcher. She was not over 30 yards from Girard and was going away from him when he fired the rifle. Girard had previously fired similarly in the vicinity of a Japanese man, who was not hit.\n\nGirard's action in firing empty shell cases from the rifle grenade launcher was not authorized. He asserted \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 546]\n\u00a0\n that he fired from the waist, intending only to frighten the Japanese civilians. Others stated, but Girard denied, that empty shell cases were thrown out to entice the Japanese to approach.\n\n.   .  .  .  .\n\n\n Under the U.S.-Japanese Security Treaty and Article XVII of the Administrative Agreement under that Treaty, as established by the Protocol adopted September 23, 1953, the authorities of Japan have the prior right to jurisdiction to try members of the United States armed forces for an injury caused to a Japanese national, unless such injury is one \"arising out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty.\"\n\nThe Japanese authorities have taken the position that Girard's action in firing the shell cases was outside the scope of his guard duty and was, therefore, not \"done in the performance of official duty.\"\n\nThe Commanding General of Girard's division certified that Girard's action was done in the performance of official duty.\n\nIn accordance with the procedure established under the Treaty and Administrative Agreement, the disputed matter was, on March 7, 1957, taken before the Joint U.S.-Japan Committee established under the provisions of the Treaty and Administrative Agreement previously referred to.\n\nVarious meetings were held between the United States and Japanese representatives on the Joint Committee. As is customary, a representative of the American Embassy in Tokyo also attended these meetings in the capacity of observer. Both sides continued to press their respective claims to primary jurisdiction, and the Committee was unable to reach agreement.\n\nThe Commanding General, Far East Command, reported the facts to the Department of the Army, the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 547]\n\u00a0\n executive agent for the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense considered having the Joint Committee refer the matter in dispute to the two Governments for settlement, but rejected this procedure as inadvisable under the circumstances. Department of Defense instructions were accordingly issued, through the Department of the Army, to the Far East Command to the effect that the U.S. representative on the Joint Committee should continue to press the claim for jurisdiction, but that, in case of continued deadlock, he was authorized to waive jurisdiction to Japan. After three weeks of additional negotiations, the U.S. representative waived jurisdiction in the name of the United States.\n\nGirard was subsequently indicted by the Japanese judicial authorities for causing a death by wounding - the least serious homicide charge for which he could have been indicted under Japanese law. In determining whether Girard's actions were in violation of law, all the facts, as presented by both sides, must now be weighed by the Japanese court, just as they would by a U.S. court-martial, if trial were held under U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nIn accordance with Public Law 777 of the 84th Congress, the United States Government will pay for counsel chosen by Girard to defend him in this trial. Pursuant to the Administrative Agreement under the Japanese Treaty, Girard will be guaranteed a prompt trial, the right to have representation by counsel satisfactory to him, full information as to all charges against him, the right to confront all witnesses, the right to have his witnesses compelled to attend court, the right to have a competent interpreter, the right of communication with United States authorities, and the presence of a United States representative as an official observer at the trial. This observer is required to report to United States authorities on all aspects of the trial and the fairness of the court proceedings. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 524, 548]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe U.S. authorities will, of course, see that all evidence is available to Girard and his counsel, and will render every proper assistance to him and his counsel in protection of his rights.\n\n.   .   .  .  .\n\n\n United States troops are stationed in many countries as part of our own national defense and to help strengthen the Free World struggle against Communist imperialism. The matter of jurisdiction in cases of offenses against the laws of host countries, whether by our servicemen abroad or by servicemen of other countries in the United States, is dealt with by mutual agreements.\n\nIn the operation of this system in Japan there has been the greatest measure of mutual trust and cooperation. Since the present arrangement became effective in October 1953, Japan, in the overwhelming majority of the cases in which it had primary right to try American personnel, has waived that right in favor of U.S. action. There is every reason to believe that trial of U.S. Army Specialist 3rd Class William S. Girard in the Japanese courts will be conducted with the utmost fairness.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] This affidavit was offered by the Government and accepted by the court below under seal. In this posture it is part of the record before us. At the oral argument no objection was made by the Government or counsel for Girard against removing the seal. As the Court considers that the issues in this case should be decided on a fully disclosed record, the affidavit is ordered unsealed.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 3 U.S. Treaties and Other International Agreements 3329; T.

Wangensteen, for Wisniewski.\n\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n  Defendant was convicted of violation of 26 C.F.R.  175.121, a Regulation promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury under the authority of  2871 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A.  2871, and providing that:\n'No liquor bottle shall be reused for the packaging of distilled spirits for sale, except as provided in  175.63 (exceptions not here relevant), nor shall the original contents, or any portion of such original contents, remaining in a liquor bottle be increased by the addition of any substance.'\n\n  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has certified to this Court the following question: 'Does the phrase 'any substance' as employed in 26 C.F.R., Section 175.121, 1952 Cumulative Pocket Supplement, include tax paid distilled spirits?'\n  It appears that the question certified by the Court of Appeals was decided by another panel of that court less than a year and a half before the present certification, on reviewing the dismissal of the indictment in this very case. United States v. Goldberg, 8 Cir., 225 F.2d 180. Because of the volume of business, all but two Circuits have more than three Circuit  problems when one panel has doubts about a previous decision by another panel of the same court. Whatever procedure a Court of Appeals follows to resolve these problems-and desirable judicial administration commends consistency at least in the more or less contemporaneous decisions of different panels of a Court of Appeals-doubt about the respect to be accorded to a previous decision of a different panel should not be the occasion for invoking so exceptional a jurisdiction of this Court as that on certification. It is primarily the task of a Court of Appeals to reconcile its internal difficulties. See In re Burwell, \n350 \nU.S. 521\n, 76 S. Ct. 539; Western Pacific R. Corp. v. Western Pacific R. Co., \n345 \nU.S. 247\n. It is also the task of a Court of Appeals to decide all properly presented cases coming before it, except in the rare instances, as for example the pendency of another case before this Court raising the same issue, when certification may be advisable in the proper administration and expedition of judicial business.\n  The certificate must be dismissed. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWOMETCO TELEVISION & THEATRE CO. v.

UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 6\nArgued: Decided: June 17, 1957\n\n\n\n\n The 14 petitioners, leaders of the Communist Party in California, were indicated in 1951 in a Federal District Court under 3 of the Smith Act and 18 U.S.C. 371 for conspiring (1) to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing the Government of the United States by force and violence, and (2) to organize, as the Communist Party of the United States, a society of persons who so advocate and teach, all with the intent of causing the overthrow of the Government by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit. The indictment charged that the conspiracy originated in 1940 and continued down to the date of the indictment and that, in carrying it out, petitioners and their co-conspirators would (a) become members and officers of the Communist Party, with knowledge of its unlawful purposes, and assume leadership in carrying out its policies and activities, (b) cause to be organized units of the Party in California and elsewhere, (c) write and publish articles on such advocacy and teaching, (d) conduct schools for the indoctrination of Party members in such advocacy and teaching, and (e) recruit new Party members, particularly from among persons employed in the key industries of the Nation. It also alleged 23 overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. Petitioners were convicted after a jury trial, and their convictions were sustained by the Court of Appeals. Held: The convictions are reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to enter judgments of acquittal as to five of the petitioners and to grant a new trial as to the others. Pp. 300-338.\n\n 1. Since the Communist Party came into being in 1945, and the indictment was not returned until 1951, the three-year statute of limitations had run on the \"organizing\" charge, and required the withdrawal of that part of the indictment from the jury's consideration. Pp. 303-312. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 299]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (a) Applying the rule that criminal statutes are to be construed strictly, the word \"organize,\" as used in the Smith Act, is construed as referring only to acts entering into the creation of a new organization, and not to acts thereafter performed in carrying on its activities, even though the latter may loosely be termed \"organizational.\" Pp. 303-311.\n\n\n  (b) The trial court's mistaken construction of the word \"organize\" was not harmless error; the circumstances are such as to call for application of the rule which requires a verdict to be set aside where it is supportable on one ground, but not another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected. Pp. 311-312.\n\n\n 2. The Smith Act does not prohibit advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow of the Government as an abstract principle, divorced from any effort to instigate action to that end; the trial court's charge to the jury furnished wholly inadequate guidance on this central point in the case; and the conviction cannot be allowed to stand. Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n, distinguished. Pp. 312-327.\n\n\n 3. The evidence against five of the petitioners is so clearly insufficient that their acquittal should be ordered, but that as to the others is such as not to justify closing the way to their retrial.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWe brought these cases here to consider certain questions arising under the Smith Act which have not heretofore been passed upon by this Court, and otherwise to review the convictions of these petitioners for conspiracy to violate that Act. Among other things, the convictions are claimed to rest upon an application of the Smith Act which is hostile to the principles upon which its constitutionality was upheld in Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n.\n\nThese 14 petitioners stand convicted, after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, upon a single count indictment charging them with conspiring (1) to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing the Government of the United States by force and violence, and (2) to organize, as the Communist Party of the United States, a society of persons who so advocate and teach, all with the intent of causing the overthrow of the Government by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit. Act of June 28, 1940, 2 (a) (1) and (3), 54 \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 301]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 670, 671, 18 U.S.C. 371, 2385.\n1\n The conspiracy is alleged to have originated in 1940 and continued down to the date of the indictment in 1951. The indictment charged that in carrying out the conspiracy the defendants \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 302]\n\u00a0\n and their co-conspirators would (a) become members and officers of the Communist Party, with knowledge of its unlawful purposes, and assume leadership in carrying out its policies and activities; (b) cause to be organized units of the Party in California and elsewhere; (c) write and publish, in the \"Daily Worker\" and other Party organs, articles on the proscribed advocacy and teaching; (d) conduct schools for the indoctrination of Party members in such advocacy and teaching, and (e) recruit new Party members, particularly from among persons employed in the key industries of the nation. Twenty-three overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were alleged.\n\nUpon conviction each of the petitioners was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and a fine of $10,000. The \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 303]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals affirmed. 225 F.2d 146. We granted certiorari for the reasons already indicated. \n350 \nU.S. 860\n.\n\nIn the view we take of this case, it is necessary for us to consider only the following of petitioners' contentions: (1) that the term \"organize\" as used in the Smith Act was erroneously construed by the two lower courts; (2) that the trial court's instructions to the jury erroneously excluded from the case the issue of \"incitement to action\"; (3) that the evidence was so insufficient as to require this Court to direct the acquittal of these petitioners; and (4) that petitioner Schneiderman's conviction was precluded by this Court's judgment in Schneiderman v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 118\n, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n2\n For reasons given hereafter, we conclude that these convictions must be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter judgments of acquittal as to certain of the petitioners, and to grant a new trial as to the rest.\n\n   I. The Term \"Organize.\"\n\n\n One object of the conspiracy charged was to violate the third paragraph of 18 U.S.C. 2385, which provides:\n\n  \"Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize  any society, group, or assembly of persons  who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or  destruction of any [government in the United States]  by force or violence . . . [s]hall be fined not more  than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years,  or both . . . .\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 304]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Petitioners claim that \"organize\" means to \"establish,\" \"found,\" or \"bring into existence,\" and that in this sense the Communist Party\n4\n was organized by 1945 at the latest.\n5\n On this basis petitioners contend that this part of the indictment, returned in 1951, was barred by the three-year statute of limitations.\n6\n The Government, on the other hand, says that \"organize\" connotes a continuing process which goes on throughout the life of an organization, and that, in the words of the trial court's instructions to the jury, the term includes such things as \"the recruiting of new members and the forming of new units, and the regrouping or expansion of existing clubs, classes and other units of any society, party, group or other organization.\" The two courts below accepted the Government's position. We think, however, that petitioners' position must prevail, upon principles stated by Chief Justice Marshall more than a century ago in United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95-96, as follows:\n\n \"The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is perhaps not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department. It is the legislature, not the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 305]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"It is said, that notwithstanding this rule, the intention of the law maker must govern in the construction of penal, as well as other statutes. This is true. But this is not a new independent rule which subverts the old. It is a modification of the ancient maxim, and amounts to this, that though penal laws are to be construed strictly, they are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature. The maxim is not to be so applied as to narrow the words of the statute to the exclusion of cases which those words, in their ordinary acceptation, or in that sense in which the legislature has obviously used them, would comprehend. The intention of the legislature is to be collected from the words they employ. Where there is no ambiguity in the words, there is no room for construction. The case must be a strong one indeed, which would justify a Court in departing from the plain meaning of words, especially in a penal act, in search of an intention which the words themselves did not suggest. To determine that a case is within the intention of a statute, its language must authorise us to say so. It would be dangerous, indeed, to carry the principle, that a case which is within the reason or mischief of a statute, is within its provisions, so far as to punish a crime not enumerated in the statute, because it is of equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those which are enumerated. If this principle has ever been recognized in expounding criminal law, it has been in cases of considerable irritation, which it would be unsafe to consider as precedents forming a general rule for other cases.\"\n\n\n The statute does not define what is meant by \"organize.\" Dictionary definitions are of little help, for, as those offered us sufficiently show, the term is susceptible \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 306]\n\u00a0\n of both meanings attributed to it by the parties here.\n7\n The fact that the Communist Party comprises various components and activities, in relation to which some of the petitioners bore the title of \"Organizer,\" does not advance us towards a solution of the problem. The charge here is that petitioners conspired to organize the Communist Party, and, unless \"organize\" embraces the continuing concept contended for by the Government, the establishing of new units within the Party and similar activities, following the Party's initial formation in 1945, have no independent significance or vitality so far as the \"organizing\" charge is involved. Nor are we here concerned with the quality of petitioners' activities as such, that is, whether particular activities may properly be categorized as \"organizational.\" Rather, the issue is whether the term \"organize\" as used in this statute is limited by temporal concepts. Stated most simply, the problem is to choose between two possible answers to the question: when was the Communist Party \"organized\"? Petitioners contend that the only natural answer to the question is the formation date - in this case, 1945. The Government would have us answer the question by saying that the Party today is still not completely \"organized\"; \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 307]\n\u00a0\n that \"organizing\" is a continuing process that does not end until the entity is dissolved.\n\nThe legislative history of the Smith Act is no more revealing as to what Congress meant by \"organize\" than is the statute itself. The Government urges that \"organize\" should be given a broad meaning since acceptance of the term in its narrow sense would require attributing to Congress the intent that this provision of the statute should not apply to the Communist Party as it then existed. The argument is that since the Communist Party as it then existed had been born in 1919 and the Smith Act was not passed until 1940, the use of \"organize\" in its narrow sense would have meant that these provisions of the statute would never have reached the act of organizing the Communist Party, except for the fortuitous rebirth of the Party in 1945 - an occurrence which, of course, could not have been foreseen in 1940. This, says the Government, could hardly have been the congressional purpose since the Smith Act as a whole was particularly aimed at the Communist Party, and its \"organizing\" provisions were especially directed at the leaders of the movement.\n\nWe find this argument unpersuasive. While the legislative history of the Smith Act does show that concern about communism was a strong factor leading to this legislation, it also reveals that the statute, which was patterned on state anti-sedition laws directed not against Communists but against anarchists and syndicalists, was aimed equally at all groups falling within its scope.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 308]\n\u00a0\n More important, there is no evidence whatever to support the thesis that the organizing provision of the statute was written with particular reference to the Communist Party. Indeed, the congressional hearings indicate that it was the \"advocating and teaching\" provision of the Act, rather than the \"organizing\" provision, which was especially thought to reach Communist activities.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nNor do there appear to be any other reasons for ascribing to \"organize\" the Government's broad interpretation. While it is understandable that Congress should have wished to supplement the general provisions of the Smith Act by a special provision directed at the activities of those responsible for creating a new organization of the proscribed type, such as was the situation involved in the Dennis case, we find nothing which suggests that the \"organizing\" provision was intended to reach beyond this, that is, to embrace the activities of those concerned with carrying on the affairs of an already existing organization. Such activities were already amply covered by other provisions of the Act, such as the \"membership\" clause,\n10\n and the basic prohibition of \"advocacy\" in conjunction with the conspiracy provision, and there is thus no need to stretch the \"organizing\" provision to fill any gaps in the statute. Moreover, it is difficult to find any considerations, comparable to those relating to persons responsible for creating a new organization, which would have led the Congress to single out for special treatment those persons occupying so-called organizational positions in an existing organization, especially when this same section of the statute proscribes membership in such an organization without drawing any distinction between those holding executive office and others. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 309]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn the other hand, we also find unpersuasive petitioners' argument as to the intent of Congress. In support of the narrower meaning of \"organize,\" they argue that the Smith Act was patterned after the California Criminal Syndicalism Act;\n11\n that the California courts have consistently taken \"organize\" in that Act in its narrow sense;\n12\n and that under such cases as Willis v. Eastern Trust & Banking Co., \n169 \nU.S. 295, 304\n, 309, and Joines v. Patterson, \n274 \nU.S. 544, 549\n, it should be presumed that Congress in adopting the wording of the California Act intended \"organize\" to have the same meaning as that given it by the California courts. As the hearings on the Smith Act show, however, its particular prototype was the New York Criminal Anarchy Act,\n13\n not the California statute, and the \"organizing\" provisions of the New York Act have never been construed by any court. Moreover, to the extent that the language of the California statute, which itself was patterned on the earlier New York legislation, might be significant, we think that little weight can be given to these California decisions. The \"general rule that adoption of the wording of a statute from another legislative jurisdiction carries with it the previous judicial interpretations of the wording . . . is a presumption of legislative intention . . . which varies in strength with the similarity of the language, the established character of the decisions in the jurisdiction from which the language was adopted and the presence or lack of other indicia of intention.\" Carolene Products Co. v. United States, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 310]\n\u00a0\n \n323 \nU.S. 18, 26\n. Here, the three California cases relied on by petitioners were all decisions of lower courts, and, in the absence of anything in the legislative history indicating that they were called to its attention, we should not assume that Congress was aware of them.\n\nWe are thus left to determine for ourselves the meaning of this provision of the Smith Act, without any revealing guides as to the intent of Congress. In these circumstances we should follow the familiar rule that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed and give to \"organize\" its narrow meaning, that is, that the word refers only to acts entering into the creation of a new organization, and not to acts thereafter performed in carrying on its activities, even though such acts may loosely be termed \"organizational.\" See United States v. Wiltberger, supra; United States v. Lacher, \n134 \nU.S. 624, 628\n; United States v. Gradwell, \n243 \nU.S. 476, 485\n; Fasulo v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 620, 628\n. Such indeed is the normal usage of the word \"organize,\"\n14\n and until the decisions below in this case the federal trial courts in which the question had arisen uniformly gave it that meaning. See United States v. Flynn, unreported (D.C. S. D. N. Y.), No. C. 137-37, aff'd, 216 F.2d 354, 358; United States v. Mesarosh, 116 F. Supp. 345, aff'd, 223 F.2d 449, 465 (dissenting opinion of Hastie, J.); see also United States v. Dennis, unreported (D.C. S. D. N. Y.), No. C. 128-87, aff'd, 183 F.2d 201, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 311]\n\u00a0\n We too think this statute should be read \"according to the natural and obvious import of the language, without resorting to subtle and forced construction for the purpose of either limiting or extending its operation.\" United States v. Temple, \n105 \nU.S. 97, 99\n.\n\nThe Government contends that even if the trial court was mistaken in its construction of the statute, the error was harmless because the conspiracy charged embraced both \"advocacy\" of violent overthrow and \"organizing\" the Communist Party, and the jury was instructed that in order to convict it must find a conspiracy extending to both objectives. Hence, the argument is, the jury must in any event be taken to have found petitioners guilty of conspiring to advocate, and the convictions are supportable on that basis alone. We cannot accept this proposition for a number of reasons. The portions of the trial court's instructions relied on by the Government are not sufficiently clear or specific to warrant our drawing the inference that the jury understood it must find an agreement extending to both \"advocacy\" and \"organizing\" in order to convict.\n16\n Further, in order to convict, the jury was required, as the court charged, to find an overt act which was \"knowingly done in furtherance of an object or purpose of the conspiracy charged in the indictment,\" and we have no way of knowing whether the overt act found by the jury was one which it believed to be in furtherance \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 312]\n\u00a0\n of the \"advocacy\" rather than the \"organizing\" objective of the alleged conspiracy. The character of most of the overt acts alleged associates them as readily with \"organizing\" as with \"advocacy.\"\n17\n In these circumstances we think the proper rule to be applied is that which requires a verdict to be set aside in cases where the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected. Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359, 367\n-368; Williams v. North Carolina, \n317 \nU.S. 287, 291\n-292; Cramer v. United States, \n325 \nU.S. 1, 36\n, n. 45.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that since the Communist Party came into being in 1945, and the indictment was not returned until 1951, the three-year statute of limitations had run on the \"organizing\" charge, and required the withdrawal of that part of the indictment from the jury's consideration. Samuel v. United States, 169 F.2d 787, 798. See also Haupt v. United States, \n330 \nU.S. 631, 641\n, n. 1; Stromberg v. California, supra, at 368.\n\n II. Instructions to the Jury.\n\n\n Petitioners contend that the instructions to the jury were fatally defective in that the trial court refused to charge that, in order to convict, the jury must find that the advocacy which the defendants conspired to promote was of a kind calculated to \"incite\" persons to action for the forcible overthrow of the Government. It is argued that advocacy of forcible overthrow as mere abstract doctrine is within the free speech protection of the First \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 313]\n\u00a0\n Amendment; that the Smith Act, consistently with that constitutional provision, must be taken as proscribing only the sort of advocacy which incites to illegal action; and that the trial court's charge, by permitting conviction for mere advocacy, unrelated to its tendency to produce forcible action, resulted in an unconstitutional application of the Smith Act. The Government, which at the trial also requested the court to charge in terms of \"incitement,\" now takes the position, however, that the true constitutional dividing line is not between inciting and abstract advocacy of forcible overthrow, but rather between advocacy as such, irrespective of its inciting qualities, and the mere discussion or exposition of violent overthrow as an abstract theory.\n\nWe print in the margin the pertinent parts of the trial court's instructions.\n18\n After telling the jury that it could \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 314]\n\u00a0\n not convict the defendants for holding or expressing mere opinions, beliefs, or predictions relating to violent overthrow, the trial court defined the content of the proscribed advocacy or teaching in the following terms, which are crucial here:\n\n \"Any advocacy or teaching which does not include the urging of force and violence as the means of overthrowing and destroying the Government of the United States is not within the issue of the indictment here and can constitute no basis for any finding against the defendants.\n\n\n \"The kind of advocacy and teaching which is charged and upon which your verdict must be \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 315]\n\u00a0\n reached is not merely a desirability but a necessity that the Government of the United States be overthrown and destroyed by force and violence and not merely a propriety but a duty to overthrow and destroy the Government of the United States by force and violence.\"\n\n\n There can be no doubt from the record that in so instructing the jury the court regarded as immaterial, and intended to withdraw from the jury's consideration, any issue as to the character of the advocacy in terms of its capacity to stir listeners to forcible action. Both the petitioners and the Government submitted proposed instructions which would have required the jury to find \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 316]\n\u00a0\n that the proscribed advocacy was not of a mere abstract doctrine of forcible overthrow, but of action to that end, by the use of language reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to such action.\n19\n The trial court rejected these proposed instructions on the ground that any necessity for giving them which may have existed at \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 317]\n\u00a0\n the time the Dennis case was tried\n20\n was removed by this Court's subsequent decision in that case. The court made it clear in colloquy with counsel that in its view the illegal advocacy was made out simply by showing that what was said dealt with forcible overthrow and that it was uttered with a specific intent to accomplish that purpose,\n21\n insisting that all such advocacy was punishable \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 318]\n\u00a0\n \"whether it is language of incitement or not.\" The Court of Appeals affirmed on a different theory, as we shall see later on.\n\nWe are thus faced with the question whether the Smith Act prohibits advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow as an abstract principle, divorced from any effort to instigate action to that end, so long as such advocacy or teaching is engaged in with evil intent. We hold that it does not.\n\nThe distinction between advocacy of abstract doctrine and advocacy directed at promoting unlawful action is one that has been consistently recognized in the opinions of this Court, beginning with Fox v. Washington, \n236 \nU.S. 273\n, and Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47\n.\n22\n This distinction was heavily underscored in Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652\n, in which the statute involved\n23\n was nearly identical with the one now before us, and where the Court, despite the narrow view there taken of the First Amendment,\n24\n said:\n\n  \"The statute does not penalize the utterance or  publication of abstract `doctrine' or academic discussion  having no quality of incitement to any concrete  action. . . . It is not the abstract `doctrine' of overthrowing  organized government by unlawful means  which is denounced by the statute, but the advocacy  of action for the accomplishment of that  purpose. . . . This [Manifesto] . . . is [in] the  language of direct incitement. . . . That the jury  were warranted in finding that the Manifesto advocated  not merely the abstract doctrine of overthrowing  organized government by force, violence and \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 319]\n\u00a0\n  unlawful means, but action to that end, is clear. . . .  That utterances inciting to the overthrow of organized  government by unlawful means, present a  sufficient danger of substantive evil to bring their  punishment within the range of legislative discretion,  is clear.\" Id., at 664-669.\n\n\n We need not, however, decide the issue before us in terms of constitutional compulsion, for our first duty is to construe this statute. In doing so we should not assume that Congress chose to disregard a constitutional danger zone so clearly marked, or that it used the words \"advocate\" and \"teach\" in their ordinary dictionary meanings when they had already been construed as terms of art carrying a special and limited connotation. See Willis v. Eastern Trust & Banking Co., supra; Joines v. Patterson, supra; James v. Appel, \n192 \nU.S. 129, 135\n. The Gitlow case and the New York Criminal Anarchy Act there involved, which furnished the prototype for the Smith Act, were both known and adverted to by Congress in the course of the legislative proceedings.\n25\n Cf. Carolene Products Co. v. United States, supra. The legislative history of the Smith Act and related bills shows beyond all question that Congress was aware of the distinction between the advocacy or teaching of abstract doctrine and the advocacy or teaching of action, and that it did not intend to disregard it.\n26\n The statute was aimed \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 320]\n\u00a0\n at the advocacy and teaching of concrete action for the forcible overthrow of the Government, and not of principles divorced from action.\n\nThe Government's reliance on this Court's decision in Dennis is misplaced. The jury instructions which were refused here were given there,\n27\n and were referred to by this Court as requiring \"the jury to find the facts essential to establish the substantive crime.\" \n341 \nU.S., at 512\n (emphasis added). It is true that at one point in the late Chief Justice's opinion it is stated that the Smith Act \"is directed at advocacy, not discussion,\" id., at 502, but it is clear that the reference was to advocacy of action, not ideas, for in the very next sentence the opinion emphasizes that the jury was properly instructed that there could be no conviction for \"advocacy in the realm of ideas.\" The two concurring opinions in that case likewise emphasize the distinction with which we are concerned. Id., at 518, 534, 536, 545, 546, 547, 571, 572.\n\nIn failing to distinguish between advocacy of forcible overthrow as an abstract doctrine and advocacy of action to that end, the District Court appears to have been led astray by the holding in Dennis that advocacy of violent action to be taken at some future time was enough. It seems to have considered that, since \"inciting\" speech is usually thought of as something calculated to induce immediate action, and since Dennis held advocacy of action for future overthrow sufficient, this meant that advocacy, irrespective of its tendency to generate action, is punishable, provided only that it is uttered with a specific intent to accomplish overthrow. In other words, the District Court apparently thought that Dennis obliterated the traditional dividing line between advocacy of abstract doctrine and advocacy of action.\n28\n\u00a0\n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 321]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis misconceives the situation confronting the Court in Dennis and what was held there. Although the jury's verdict, interpreted in light of the trial court's instructions,\n29\n did not justify the conclusion that the defendants' advocacy was directed at, or created any danger of, immediate overthrow, it did establish that the advocacy was aimed at building up a seditious group and maintaining it in readiness for action at a propitious time. In such circumstances, said Chief Justice Vinson, the Government need not hold its hand \"until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited. If Government is aware that a group aiming at its overthrow is attempting to indoctrinate its members and to commit them to a course whereby they will strike when the leaders feel the circumstances permit, action by the Government is required.\" \n341 \nU.S., at 509\n. The essence of the Dennis holding was that indoctrination of a group in preparation for future violent action, as well as exhortation to immediate action, by advocacy found to be directed to \"action for the accomplishment\" of forcible overthrow, to violence as \"a rule-or principle of action,\" and employing \"language of incitement,\" id., at 511-512, is not constitutionally protected when the group is of sufficient size and cohesiveness, is sufficiently oriented towards action, and other circumstances are such as reasonably to justify apprehension that action will occur. This is quite a different thing from the view of the District Court here that mere doctrinal justification of forcible overthrow, if engaged in with the intent to accomplish overthrow, is punishable per se under the Smith Act. That sort of advocacy, even though uttered with the hope that it may ultimately lead to violent revolution, is too remote from concrete action to be regarded \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 322]\n\u00a0\n as the kind of indoctrination preparatory to action which was condemned in Dennis. As one of the concurring opinions in Dennis put it: \"Throughout our decisions there has recurred a distinction between the statement of an idea which may prompt its hearers to take unlawful action, and advocacy that such action be taken.\" Id., at 545. There is nothing in Dennis which makes that historic distinction obsolete.\n\nThe Court of Appeals took a different view from that of the District Court. While seemingly recognizing that the proscribed advocacy must be associated in some way with action, and that the instructions given the jury here fell short in that respect, it considered that the instructions which the trial court refused were unnecessary in this instance because establishment of the conspiracy, here charged under the general conspiracy statute, required proof of an overt act, whereas in Dennis, where the conspiracy was charged under the Smith Act, no overt act was required.\n30\n In other words, the Court of Appeals thought that the requirement of proving an overt act was an adequate substitute for the linking of the advocacy to action which would otherwise have been necessary.\n31\n This, of course, is a mistaken notion, for the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 323]\n\u00a0\n overt act will not necessarily evidence the character of the advocacy engaged in, nor, indeed, is an agreement to advocate forcible overthrow itself an unlawful conspiracy if it does not call for advocacy of action. The statement in Dennis that \"it is the existence of the conspiracy which creates the danger,\" \n341 \nU.S., at 511\n, does not support the Court of Appeals. Bearing in mind that Dennis, like all other Smith Act conspiracy cases thus far, including this one, involved advocacy which had already taken place, and not advocacy still to occur, it is clear that in context the phrase just quoted referred to more than the basic agreement to advocate. \"The mere fact that [during the indictment period] petitioners' activities did not result in an attempt to overthrow the Government by force and violence is of course no answer to the fact that there was a group that was ready to make the attempt. The formation by petitioners of such a highly organized conspiracy, with rigidly disciplined members subject to call when the leaders, these petitioners, felt that \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 324]\n\u00a0\n the time had come for action, coupled with . . . world conditions, . . . disposes of the contention that a conspiracy to advocate, as distinguished from the advocacy itself, cannot be constitutionally restrained, because it comprises only the preparation. It is the existence of the conspiracy which creates the danger. . . . If the ingredients of the reaction are present, we cannot bind the Government to wait until the catalyst is added.\" \n341 \nU.S., at 510\n-511 (emphasis supplied). The reference of the term \"conspiracy,\" in context, was to an agreement to accomplish overthrow at some future time, implicit in the jury's findings under the instructions given, rather than to an agreement to speak. Dennis was thus not concerned with a conspiracy to engage at some future time in seditious advocacy, but rather with a conspiracy to advocate presently the taking of forcible action in the future. It was action, not advocacy, that was to be postponed until \"circumstances\" would \"permit.\" We intimate no views as to whether a conspiracy to engage in advocacy in the future, where speech would thus be separated from action by one further remove, is punishable under the Smith Act.\n\nWe think, thus, that both of the lower courts here misconceived Dennis.\n\nIn light of the foregoing we are unable to regard the District Court's charge upon this aspect of the case as adequate. The jury was never told that the Smith Act does not denounce advocacy in the sense of preaching abstractly the forcible overthrow of the Government. We think that the trial court's statement that the proscribed advocacy must include the \"urging,\" \"necessity,\" and \"duty\" of forcible overthrow, and not merely its \"desirability\" and \"propriety,\" may not be regarded as a sufficient substitute for charging that the Smith Act reaches only advocacy of action for the overthrow of government by force and violence. The essential distinction \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 325]\n\u00a0\n is that those to whom the advocacy is addressed must be urged to do something, now or in the future, rather than merely to believe in something. At best the expressions used by the trial court were equivocal, since in the absence of any instructions differentiating advocacy of abstract doctrine from advocacy of action, they were as consistent with the former as they were with the latter. Nor do we regard their ambiguity as lessened by what the trial court had to say as to the right of the defendants to announce their beliefs as to the inevitability of violent revolution, or to advocate other unpopular opinions. Especially when it is unmistakable that the court did not consider the urging of action for forcible overthrow as being a necessary element of the proscribed advocacy, but rather considered the crucial question to be whether the advocacy was uttered with a specific intent to accomplish such overthrow,\n32\n we would not be warranted in assuming that the jury drew from these instructions more than the court itself intended them to convey.\n\nNor can we accept the Government's argument that the District Court was justified in not charging more than it did because the refused instructions proposed by both sides specified that the advocacy must be of a character reasonably calculated to \"incite\" to forcible overthrow, a term which, it is now argued, might have conveyed to the jury an implication that the advocacy must be of immediate action. Granting that some qualification of the proposed instructions would have been permissible to dispel such an implication, and that it was not necessary even that the trial court should have employed the particular term \"incite,\" it was nevertheless incumbent on the court to make clear in some fashion that the advocacy must be of action and not merely abstract doctrine. The instructions given not only do not employ the word \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 326]\n\u00a0\n \"incite,\" but also avoid the use of such terms and phrases as \"action,\" \"call for action,\" \"as a rule or principle of action,\" and so on, all of which were offered in one form or another by both the petitioners and the Government.\n33\n\u00a0\n\nWhat we find lacking in the instructions here is illustrated by contrasting them with the instructions given to the Dennis jury, upon which this Court's sustaining of the convictions in that case was bottomed. There the trial court charged:\n\n  \"In further construction and interpretation of the  statute [the Smith Act] I charge you that it is not  the abstract doctrine of overthrowing or destroying  organized government by unlawful means which is  denounced by this law, but the teaching and advocacy  of action for the accomplishment of that  purpose, by language reasonably and ordinarily calculated  to incite persons to such action. Accordingly,  you cannot find the defendants or any of them  guilty of the crime charged unless you are satisfied  beyond a reasonable doubt that they conspired . . .  to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing  or destroying the Government of the United  States by force and violence, with the intent that  such teaching and advocacy be of a rule or principle  of action and by language reasonably and ordinarily  calculated to incite persons to such action, all with  the intent to cause the overthrow . . . as speedily  as circumstances would permit.\" (Emphasis added.)  9 F. R. D. 367, 391; and see \n341 \nU.S., at 511\n-512.\n\n\n We recognize that distinctions between advocacy or teaching of abstract doctrines, with evil intent, and that which is directed to stirring people to action, are often subtle and difficult to grasp, for in a broad sense, as Mr. Justice Holmes said in his dissenting opinion in Gitlow, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 327]\n\u00a0\n supra, \n268 \nU.S., at 673\n: \"Every idea is an incitement.\" But the very subtlety of these distinctions required the most clear and explicit instructions with reference to them, for they concerned an issue which went to the very heart of the charges against these petitioners. The need for precise and understandable instructions on this issue is further emphasized by the equivocal character of the evidence in this record, with which we deal in Part III of this opinion. Instances of speech that could be considered to amount to \"advocacy of action\" are so few and far between as to be almost completely overshadowed by the hundreds of instances in the record in which overthrow, if mentioned at all, occurs in the course of doctrinal disputation so remote from action as to be almost wholly lacking in probative value. Vague references to \"revolutionary\" or \"militant\" action of an unspecified character, which are found in the evidence, might in addition be given too great weight by the jury in the absence of more precise instructions. Particularly in light of this record, we must regard the trial court's charge in this respect as furnishing wholly inadequate guidance to the jury on this central point in the case. We cannot allow a conviction to stand on such \"an equivocal direction to the jury on a basic issue.\" Bollenbach v. United States, \n326 \nU.S. 607, 613\n.\n\n   III. The Evidence.\n\n\n The determinations already made require a reversal of these convictions. Nevertheless, in the exercise of our power under 28 U.S.C. 2106 to \"direct the entry of such appropriate judgment . . . as may be just under the circumstances,\" we have conceived it to be our duty to scrutinize this lengthy record\n34\n with care, in order to determine whether the way should be left open for a new trial of all or some of these petitioners. Such a judgment, we \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 328]\n\u00a0\n think, should, on the one hand, foreclose further proceedings against those of the petitioners as to whom the evidence in this record would be palpably insufficient upon a new trial, and should, on the other hand, leave the Government free to retry the other petitioners under proper legal standards, especially since it is by no means clear that certain aspects of the evidence against them could not have been clarified to the advantage of the Government had it not been under a misapprehension as to the burden cast upon it by the Smith Act. In judging the record by these criteria we do not apply to these cases the rigorous standards of review which, for example, the Court of Appeals would be required to apply in reviewing the evidence if any of these petitioners are convicted upon a retrial. Compare Dennis v. United States, supra, at 516. Rather, we have scrutinized the record to see whether there are individuals as to whom acquittal is unequivocally demanded. We do this because it is in general too hypothetical and abstract an inquiry to try to judge whether the evidence would have been inadequate had the cases been submitted under a proper charge, and had the Government realized that all its evidence must be channeled into the \"advocacy\" rather than the \"organizing\" charge. We think we may do this by drawing on our power under 28 U.S.C. 2106, because under that statute we would no doubt be justified in refusing to order acquittal even where the evidence might be deemed palpably insufficient, particularly since petitioners have asked in the alternative for a new trial as well as for acquittal. See Bryan v. United States, \n338 \nU.S. 552\n.\n\nOn this basis we have concluded that the evidence against petitioners Connelly, Kusnitz, Richmond, Spector, and Steinberg is so clearly insufficient that their acquittal should be ordered, but that as to petitioners Carlson, Dobbs, Fox, Healey (Mrs. Connelly), Lambert, Lima, Schneiderman, Stack, and Yates, we would not be justified \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 329]\n\u00a0\n in closing the way to their retrial. We proceed to the reasons for these conclusions.\n\nAt the outset, in view of the conclusions reached in Part I of this opinion, we must put aside as against all petitioners the evidence relating to the \"organizing\" aspect of the alleged conspiracy, except insofar as it bears upon the \"advocacy\" charge. That, indeed, dilutes in a substantial way a large part of the evidence, for the record unmistakably indicates that the Government relied heavily on its \"organizing\" charge. Two further general observations should also be made about the evidence as to the \"advocacy\" charge. The first is that both the Government and the trial court evidently proceeded on the theory that advocacy of abstract doctrine was enough to offend the Smith Act, whereas, as we have held, it is only advocacy of forcible action that is proscribed. The second observation is that both the record and the Government's brief in this Court make it clear that the Government's thesis was that the Communist Party, or at least the Communist Party of California, constituted the conspiratorial group, and that membership in the conspiracy could therefore be proved by showing that the individual petitioners were actively identified with the Party's affairs and thus inferentially parties to its tenets. This might have been well enough towards making out the Government's case if advocacy of the abstract doctrine of forcible overthrow satisfied the Smith Act, for we would at least have little difficulty in saying on this record that a jury could justifiably conclude that such was one of the tenets of the Communist Party; and there was no dispute as to petitioners' active identification with Party affairs. But when it comes to Party advocacy or teaching in the sense of a call to forcible action at some future time we cannot but regard this record as strikingly deficient. At best this voluminous record shows but a half dozen or so scattered incidents which, even under the loosest \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 330]\n\u00a0\n standards, could be deemed to show such advocacy. Most of these were not connected with any of the petitioners, or occurred many years before the period covered by the indictment. We are unable to regard this sporadic showing as sufficient to justify viewing the Communist Party as the nexus between these petitioners and the conspiracy charged. We need scarcely say that however much one may abhor even the abstract preaching of forcible overthrow of government, or believe that forcible overthrow is the ultimate purpose to which the Communist Party is dedicated, it is upon the evidence in the record that the petitioners must be judged in this case.\n\nWe must, then, look elsewhere than to the evidence concerning the Communist Party as such for the existence of the conspiracy to advocate charged in the indictment. As to the petitioners Connelly, Kusnitz, Richmond, Spector, and Steinberg we find no adequate evidence in the record which would permit a jury to find that they were members of such a conspiracy. For all purposes relevant here, the sole evidence as to them was that they had long been members, officers or functionaries of the Communist Party of California; and that standing alone, as Congress has enacted in 4 (f) of the Internal Security Act of 1950,\n35\n makes out no case against them. So far as this record shows, none of them has engaged in or been associated with any but what appear to have been wholly lawful activities,\n36\n or has ever made a single remark or \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 331]\n\u00a0\n been present when someone else made a remark, which would tend to prove the charges against them. Connelly and Richmond were, to be sure, the Los Angeles and Executive Editors, respectively, of the Daily People's World, the West Coast Party organ, but we can find nothing in the material introduced into evidence from that newspaper which advances the Government's case.\n\nMoreover, apart from the inadequacy of the evidence to show, at best, more than the abstract advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow by the Party, it is difficult to perceive how the requisite specific intent to accomplish such overthrow could be deemed proved by a showing of mere membership or the holding of office in the Communist Party. We therefore think that as to these petitioners the evidence was entirely too meagre to justify putting them to a new trial, and that their acquittal should be ordered.\n\nAs to the nine remaining petitioners, we consider that a different conclusion should be reached. There was testimony from the witness Foard, and other evidence, tying Fox, Healey, Lambert, Lima, Schneiderman, Stack, and Yates to Party classes conducted in the San Francisco area during the year 1946, where there occurred what might be considered to be the systematic teaching and advocacy of illegal action which is condemned by the statute. It might be found that one of the purposes of such classes was to develop in the members of the group a readiness to engage at the crucial time, perhaps during war or during attack upon the United States from without, in such activities as sabotage and street fighting, in order to divert and diffuse the resistance of the authorities and if possible to seize local vantage points. There was also testimony as to activities in the Los Angeles area, during the period covered by the indictment, which might be considered to amount to \"advocacy of action,\" and with which petitioners Carlson and Dobbs were linked. From the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 332]\n\u00a0\n testimony of the witness Scarletto, it might be found that individuals considered to be particularly trustworthy were taken into an \"underground\" apparatus and there instructed in tasks which would be useful when the time for violent action arrived. Scarletto was surreptitiously indoctrinated in methods, as he said, of moving \"masses of people in time of crisis.\" It might be found, under all the circumstances, that the purpose of this teaching was to prepare the members of the underground apparatus to engage in, to facilitate, and to cooperate with violent action directed against government when the time was ripe. In short, while the record contains evidence of little more than a general program of educational activity by the Communist Party which included advocacy of violence as a theoretical matter, we are not prepared to say, at this stage of the case, that it would be impossible for a jury, resolving all conflicts in favor of the Government and giving the evidence as to these San Francisco and Los Angeles episodes its utmost sweep, to find that advocacy of action was also engaged in when the group involved was thought particularly trustworthy, dedicated, and suited for violent tasks.\n\nNor can we say that the evidence linking these nine petitioners to that sort of advocacy, with the requisite specific intent, is so tenuous as not to justify their retrial under proper legal standards. Fox, Healey, Lambert, Lima, Schneiderman, Stack, and Yates, as members of the State and San Francisco County Boards, were shown to have been closely associated with Ida Rothstein, the principal teacher of the San Francisco classes, who also during this same period arranged in a devious and conspiratorial manner for the holding of Board meetings at the home of the witness Honig, which were attended by these petitioners. It was also shown that from time to time instructions emanated from the Boards or their members to instructors of groups at lower levels. And while none \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 333]\n\u00a0\n of the written instructions produced at the trial were invidious in themselves, it might be inferred that additional instructions were given which were not reduced to writing. Similarly, there was evidence of close association between petitioners Carlson and Dobbs and associates or superiors of the witness Scarletto, which might be taken as indicating that these two petitioners had knowledge of the apparatus in which Scarletto was active. And finally, all of these nine petitioners were shown either to have made statements themselves, or apparently approved statements made in their presence, which a jury might take as some evidence of their participation with the requisite intent in a conspiracy to advocate illegal action.\n\nAs to these nine petitioners, then, we shall not order an acquittal.\n\nBefore leaving the evidence, we consider it advisable, in order to avoid possible misapprehension upon a new trial, to deal briefly with petitioners' contention that the evidence was insufficient to prove the overt act required for conviction of conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. 371. Only 2 of the 11 overt acts alleged in the indictment to have occurred within the period of the statute of limitations were proved. Each was a public meeting held under Party auspices at which speeches were made by one or more of the petitioners extolling leaders of the Soviet Union and criticizing various aspects of the foreign policy of the United States. At one of the meetings an appeal for funds was made. Petitioners contend that these meetings do not satisfy the requirement of the statute that there be shown an act done by one of the conspirators \"to effect the object of the conspiracy.\" The Government concedes that nothing unlawful was shown to have been said or done at these meetings, but contends that these occurrences nonetheless sufficed as overt acts under the jury's findings. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 334]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe think the Government's position is correct. It is not necessary that an overt act be the substantive crime charged in the indictment as the object of the conspiracy. Pierce v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 239, 244\n; United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 \nU.S. 78, 86\n. Nor, indeed, need such an act, taken by itself, even be criminal in character. Braverman v. United States, \n317 \nU.S. 49\n. The function of the overt act in a conspiracy prosecution is simply to manifest \"that the conspiracy is at work,\" Carlson v. United States, 187 F.2d 366, 370, and is neither a project still resting solely in the minds of the conspirators nor a fully completed operation no longer in existence. The substantive offense here charged as the object of the conspiracy is speech rather than the specific action that typically constitutes the gravamen of a substantive criminal offense. Were we to hold that some concrete action leading to the overthrow of the Government was required, as petitioners appear to suggest, we would have changed the nature of the offense altogether. No such drastic change in the law can be drawn from Congress' perfunctory action in 1948 bringing Smith Act cases within 18 U.S.C. 371.\n\nWhile upon a new trial the overt act must be found, in view of what we have held, to have been in furtherance of a conspiracy to \"advocate,\" rather than to \"organize,\" we are not prepared to say that one of the episodes relied on here could not be found to be in furtherance of such an objective, if, under proper instructions, a jury should find that the Communist Party was a vehicle through which the alleged conspiracy was promoted. While in view of our acquittal of Steinberg, the first of these episodes, in which he is alleged to have been involved, may no longer be relied on as an overt act, this would not affect the second episode, in which petitioner Schneiderman was alleged and proved to have participated.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons we think that the way must be left open for a new trial to the extent indicated. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 335]\n\u00a0\n\n\n   IV. Collateral Estoppel.\n\n\n There remains to be dealt with petitioner Schneiderman's claim based on the doctrine of collateral estoppel by judgment. Petitioner urges that in Schneiderman v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 118\n, a denaturalization proceeding in which he was the prevailing party, this Court made determinations favorable to him which are conclusive in this proceeding under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Specifically, petitioner contends that the Schneiderman decision determined, for purposes of this proceeding, (1) that the teaching of Marxism-Leninism by the Communist Party was not necessarily the advocacy of violent overthrow of government; (2) that at least one tenable conclusion to be drawn from the evidence was that the Communist Party desired to achieve its goal of socialism through peaceful means; (3) that it could not be presumed, merely because of his membership or officership in the Communist Party, that Schneiderman adopted an illegal interpretation of Marxist doctrine; and finally, (4) that absent proof of overt acts indicating that Schneiderman personally adopted a reprehensible interpretation, the Government had failed to establish its burden by the clear and unequivocal evidence necessary in a denaturalization case. In the courts below, petitioner urged unsuccessfully that these determinations were conclusive in this proceeding under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and entitled him either to an acquittal or to special instructions to the jury. He makes the same contentions here.\n\nWe are in agreement with petitioner that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is not made inapplicable by the fact that this is a criminal case, whereas the prior proceedings were civil in character. United States v. Oppenheimer, \n242 \nU.S. 85\n. We agree further that the nonexistence of a fact may be established by a judgment no less than its \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 336]\n\u00a0\n existence; that, in other words, a party may be precluded under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from attempting a second time to prove a fact that he sought unsuccessfully to prove in a prior action. Sealfon v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 575\n. Nor need we quarrel with petitioner's premise that the standard of proof applicable in denaturalization cases is at least no greater than that applicable in criminal proceedings. Compare Helvering v. Mitchell, \n303 \nU.S. 391\n; Murphy v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 630\n. We assume, without deciding, that substantially the same standards of proof are applicable in the two types of cases. Cf. Klapprott v. United States, \n335 \nU.S. 601, 612\n. Nevertheless, for reasons that will appear, we think that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not help petitioner here.\n\nWe differ with petitioner, first of all, in his estimate of what the Schneiderman case determined for purposes of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. That doctrine makes conclusive in subsequent proceedings only determinations of fact, and mixed fact and law, that were essential to the decision. Commissioner v. Sunnen, \n333 \nU.S. 591, 601\n-602; Tait v. Western Maryland R. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 620\n; The Evergreens v. Nunan, 141 F.2d 927, 928. As we read the Schneiderman opinion, the only determination essential to the decision was that Schneiderman had not, prior to 1927, adopted an interpretation of the Communist Party's teachings featuring \"agitation and exhortation calling for present violent action.\" \n320 \nU.S., at 157\n-159. If it be accepted that the holding extended in the alternative to the character of advocacy engaged in by the Communist Party, then the essential finding was that the Party had not, in 1927, engaged in \"agitation and exhortation calling for present violent action.\" Ibid. The Court in Schneiderman certainly did not purport to determine what the doctrinal content of \"Marxism-Leninism\" might be at all times and in all places. Nor did it establish that the books and pamphlets introduced against \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 337]\n\u00a0\n Schneiderman in that proceeding could not support in any way an inference of criminality, no matter how or by whom they might thereafter be used. At most, we think, it made the determinations we have stated, limited to the time and place that were then in issue.\n\nIt is therefore apparent that the determinations made by this Court in Schneiderman could not operate as a complete bar to this proceeding. Wholly aside from the fact that the Court was there concerned with the state of affairs existing in 1927, whereas we are concerned here with the period 1948-1951, the issues in the present case are quite different. We are not concerned here with whether petitioner has engaged in \"agitation and exhortation calling for present violent action,\" whether in 1927 or later. Even if it were conclusively established against the Government that neither petitioner nor the Communist Party had ever engaged in such advocacy, that circumstance would constitute no bar to a conviction under 18 U.S.C. 371 of conspiring to advocate forcible overthrow of government in violation of the Smith Act. It is not necessary for conviction here that advocacy of \"present violent action\" be proved. Petitioner's demand for judgment of acquittal must therefore be rejected. The decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Cement Institute, \n333 \nU.S. 683, 708\n-709, is precisely in point and is controlling.\n\nWhat we have said we think also disposes of petitioner's contention that the trial court should have instructed the jury that certain evidentiary or subordinate issues must be taken as conclusively determined in his favor. The argument is that the determinations made in the Schneiderman case are not wholly irrelevant to this case, even if they do not conclude it, and hence that petitioner should be entitled to an instruction giving those determinations such partial conclusive effect as they might warrant. We think, however, that the doctrine \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 338]\n\u00a0\n of collateral estoppel does not establish any such concept of \"conclusive evidence\" as that contended for by petitioner. The normal rule is that a prior judgment need be given no conclusive effect at all unless it establishes one of the ultimate facts in issue in the subsequent proceeding. So far as merely evidentiary or \"mediate\" facts are concerned, the doctrine of collateral estoppel is inoperative. The Evergreens v. Nunan, 141 F.2d 927; Restatement, Judgments 68, comment p. Whether there are any circumstances in which the giving of limiting instructions such as those requested here might be necessary or proper, we need not now determine. Cf. Bordonaro Bros. Theatres, Inc. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 203 F.2d 676, 678. It is sufficient for us to hold that in this case the matters of fact and mixed fact and law necessarily determined by the prior judgment, limited as they were to the year 1927, were so remote from the issues as to justify their exclusion from evidence in the discretion of the trial judge.\n\nSince there must be a new trial, we have not found it necessary to deal with the contentions of the petitioners as to the fairness of the trial already held. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON, concurring in the result.\n\nI agree with the result reached by the Court, and with the opinion of the Court except as to its interpretation of the term \"organize\" as used in the Smith Act. As to that, I agree with the interpretation given it by the Court of Appeals. 225 F.2d 146.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Smith Act, as enacted in 1940, provided in pertinent part as follows: \"SEC. 2. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person - \"(1) to knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence . . .; \"(2) with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States, to print, publish, edit, issue, circulate, sell, distribute, or publicly display any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence; \"(3) to organize or help to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States by force or violence; or to be or become a member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof.  .   .   .   .   . \"SEC. 3.

Section 2385 provided in pertinent part as follows: \"Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the government of the United States . . . by force or violence . . .; or \"Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such government, prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells, distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter advocating, \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 302]\n\u00a0\n advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence . . .; or \"Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force or violence; or becomes or is a member of, or affiliates with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof - \"Shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both . . . .\" For convenience the original Smith Act and 2385 will both be referred to in this opinion as \"the Smith Act.\" It will be noted that the recodification did not carry into 2385 the conspiracy section of the Smith Act ( 3). The latter provision, however, was in substance restored to 2385 on July 24, 1956, to apply to offenses committed on or after that date. 70 Stat. 623. The conspiracy charged in this case was laid under 3 of the Smith Act for the period 1940 to September 1, 1948, and for the period thereafter, down to the filing of the indictment in 1951, under the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 371, providing in pertinent part as follows: \"If two or more persons conspire . . . to commit any offense against the United States, . . . and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] We find it unnecessary to consider the petitioners' contention with respect to the District Court's alleged failure to apply the \"clear and present danger\" rule, as well as the contention that their motions for a new trial and a continuance were erroneously denied.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See note 1, supra, at p. 302.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Except where otherwise indicated, throughout this opinion \"Communist Party\" refers to the present Communist Party of the United States.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] It is not disputed that the Communist Party, as referred to in the indictment, came into being no later than July 1945, when the Communist Political Association was disbanded and reconstituted as the Communist Party of the United States. The original Party was founded in this country in 1919.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 62 Stat. 828, 18 U.S.C. 3282.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Both petitioners and the Government cite the following definitions of \"organize\" from Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed.): \"1. To furnish with organs; to give an organic structure to. . . . 2. To arrange or constitute in interdependent parts, each having a special function, act, office, or relation with respect to the whole; to systematize; to get into working order; as, to organize an army; to organize recruits.\" The Government also gives us the following from Funk & Wagnall's New Standard Dictionary (1947): \"1. To bring into systematic connection and cooperation as parts of a whole, or to bring the various parts of into effective correlation and cooperation; as, to organize the peasants into an army.\" And petitioners cite Black's Law Dictionary, as follows: \"To establish or furnish with organs; to systematize; to put into working order; to arrange in order for the normal exercise of its appropriate functions.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Representative John W.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, following the Ninth Circuit, has likewise given the term its broader meaning. Wellman v. United States, 227 F.2d 757.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The trial court did no more on this score than to charge, in the language of the indictment, that the conspiracy had two objects, namely, to advocate and teach forcible overthrow and to organize the Communist Party as a vehicle for that purpose, and then instruct the jury that it must find that \"the conspiracy charged in the indictment\" had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Of the 23 overt acts charged, 20 alleged attendance of various defendants at meetings or conventions, and 3 alleged the issuance and circulation of \"directives\" by certain of the defendants. Only two of the acts alleged were proved. Both were Party meetings unmarked by any advocacy of the type that the petitioners were allegedly conspiring to promote.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The trial court charged: \"As used in the Smith Act and the indictment: \"(1) the word `advocate' means to urge or `to plead in favor of; . . . to support, vindicate, or recommend publicly . . .'; \"(2) the word `teach' means `to instruct . . . show how . . . to guide the studies of . . .';  .   .  .  .  . \"The holding of a belief or opinion does not constitute advocacy or teaching. Hence the Smith Act does not prohibit persons who may believe that the violent overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States is probable or inevitable from expressing that belief. Whether such belief be reasonable or unreasonable is immaterial. Prediction or prophecy is not advocacy. \"Any advocacy or teaching which does not include the urging of force and violence as the means of overthrowing and destroying the Government of the United States is not within the issue of the indictment here and can constitute no basis for any finding against the defendants. \"The kind of advocacy and teaching which is charged and upon which your verdict must be reached is not merely a desirability but a necessity that the Government of the United States be overthrown and destroyed by force and violence and not merely a propriety \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 314]\n\u00a0\n but a duty to overthrow and destroy the Government of the United States by force and violence.  .   .  .  .  . \"The word `wilfully,' as used in the indictment, means a statement or declaration made or other act done with the specific intent to cause or bring about the overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit. \"The defendants, in common with all other persons living under our Constitution, have a general right protected by the First Amendment to hold, express, teach and advocate opinions, even though their opinions are rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American people; and have the further right to organize or combine peaceably with other persons for the purpose of spreading and promoting their opinions more effectively. \"Whether you agree with these opinions or whether they seem to you reasonable, unreasonable, absurd, distasteful or hateful has no bearing whatever on the right of other persons to maintain them and to seek to persuade others of their validity. \"No inference that any of the defendants knowingly and wilfully conspired as charged in the indictment, or intended to cause or bring about the overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit, may be drawn from the advocacy or teaching of \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 315]\n\u00a0\n socialism or other economic or political or social doctrines, by reason of any unpopularity of such doctrines or by reason of any opinion you may hold with respect to whether such doctrines, or the opinions or beliefs of any of the defendants, are unreasonable, distasteful, absurd or hateful. \"The defendants, in common with other persons living under our Constitution, have the right protected by the First Amendment to criticize our system of Government and the Government itself, even though the speaking or writing of such criticism may undermine confidence in the Government or cause or increase discontent. They have the right also to criticize the foreign policy of the United States and the role being played by this country in international affairs; and to praise the foreign policy of other governments and the role being played by those governments in international affairs. \"The right of the defendants to enjoy such freedom of expression is unaffected by whether or not the opinions spoken or published may seem to you to be crudely intemperate, or to contain falsehoods, or to be designed to embarrass the Government. No inference of conspiracy to advocate and teach the necessity and duty of overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence, or of intent to cause or bring about the overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit, may be drawn from such expressions alone.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Petitioners' proposed instructions were: \"Where the Smith Act, the statute which these defendants are charged with conspiring to violate, speaks of advocating and teaching the duty and necessity of overthrowing the Government by force and violence, this refers only to statements which, in the language of incitement to action, urge immediate action to overthrow the then existing government under the then existing circumstances. A statement on the other hand, that, if our form of government should change in the future, violent overthrow of the government would then become necessary and right, is not within the Smith Act's prohibition and would not constitute any basis for a finding against the defendants here.  .  .  .  .  . \"For purposes of this trial, a person can be said to teach or advocate the overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence only when his expression are designed to induce action, rather than discussion or belief, and only when they are expressed in language which, under the circumstances in which it is used, is reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to such action, rather than merely to discussion or belief.  .  .  .  .  . \"The burden is on the prosecution to show beyond a reasonable doubt that a common understanding existed among the alleged co-conspirators as to the specific content of expressions amounting to advocacy of the overthrow and destruction of the Government by force and violence. The Government must further show that this understanding included and understanding that such advocacy would be in language amounting to incitement to action and that it would take place under circumstances such as to lead to a probability that it would inspire persons to take action toward violent overthrow. \"The Government's burden is not met by proof that the defendant shared certain beliefs and made joint efforts to persuade other persons to adopt them, no matter what you may find the content of such \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 317]\n\u00a0\n beliefs to have been, or whether you may agree or disagree with such beliefs.\" The Government's proposed instruction was: \"In further construction and interpretation of the statute I charge you that it is not the abstract doctrine of overthrowing or destroying organized government by unlawful means which is denounced by this law, but the teaching and advocacy of action for the accomplishment of that purpose, by language reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to such action. Accordingly, you cannot find the defendants or any of them guilty of the crime charged unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that they conspired to organize a society, group and assembly of persons who teach and advocate the overthrow or destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence and to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing or destroying the Government of the United States by force and violence, with the intent that such teaching and advocacy be of a rule or principle of action and by language reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to such action, all with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] The Government's proposed instruction was that given by the trial court in the Dennis case, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n. See p. 326, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Having stated that all advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow of Government was punishable \"whether it is language of incitement or not,\" so long as it was done with the requisite intent, the court added, \"It seems to me this question of `incitement to' is involved around the question of sufficiency of evidence to indicate intent. The language used is language of philosophy and theory and academic treatment, rather than language . . . [of] `incitement to action.' If the jury should convict on that sort of language, [the] argument would be the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] For discussion of the principal cases in this Court on the subject, see the several opinions in Dennis v.

Another phrase given approval is that the doctrine of destruction had become a `rule of action.' In conjunction with an indictment based upon such a statute proscribing organization for the purpose of teaching and advocating overthrow, but which required neither proof of overt acts nor a specifically planned objective, such precautionary instructions were well enough. But these expressions of the judges in instructions in connection with the original statute established no unalterable requirement that such phrases themselves be used \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 323]\n\u00a0\n ipsissimis verbis where the changes in the basic law and an entirely different indictment predicated upon the conspiracy statute have rendered admonitions to a jury in such language supererogatory.\" And further at p. 162: \"The gist of the substantive crime of conspiracy is that an unlawful combination and agreement becomes a positive crime only when some of the proved conspirators enter the field of action pursuant to the criminal design. Therefore, if the conspiracy did not become a rule of action pursuant to the proscribed intent, there would have been no violation of the conspiracy statute. The use of such phrases [as incitement] in instructions might have been well enough where a violation of the Smith Act alone was charged in its original form. It would be folly to command imperatively that these specific phrases be each used in instructions after a trial on an indictment such as the present one.\" It may also be noted that for the period 1940 to September 1, 1948 (see note 1, supra), the conspiracy charge here was laid under the old Smith Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] See pp. 317-318, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] See note 19, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] The record consists of some 14,000 typewritten pages.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] 64 Stat. 987, 50 U.S.C. 783 (f): \"Neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization by any person shall constitute per se a violation of subsection (a) or subsection (c) of this section or of any other criminal statute.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] While there was evidence that might tend to link petitioner Richmond to \"the conspiracy,\" i. e., evidence of association by him with other petitioners, and with an individual who might be found by the jury to have engaged during the same period in the proscribed advocacy, see pp. 332-333, infra, we think that without more such evidence would not justify refusal to direct an acquittal. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 339]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nI would reverse every one of these convictions and direct that all the defendants be acquitted. In my judgment the statutory provisions on which these prosecutions are based abridge freedom of speech, press and assembly in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. See my dissent and that of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS in Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494, 579\n, 581. Also see my opinion in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382, 445\n.\n\nThe kind of trials conducted here are wholly dissimilar to normal criminal trials. Ordinarily these \"Smith Act\" trials are prolonged affairs lasting for months. In part this is attributable to the routine introduction in evidence of massive collections of books, tracts, pamphlets, newspapers, and manifestoes discussing Communism, Socialism, Capitalism, Feudalism and governmental institutions in general, which, it is not too much to say, are turgid, diffuse, abstruse, and just plain dull. Of course, no juror can or is expected to plow his way through this jungle of verbiage. The testimony of witnesses is comparatively insignificant. Guilt or innocence may turn on what Marx or Engels or someone else wrote or advocated as much as a hundred or more years ago. Elaborate, refined distinctions are drawn between \"Communism,\" \"Marxism,\" \"Leninism,\" \"Trotskyism,\" and \"Stalinism.\" When the propriety of obnoxious or unorthodox views about government is in reality made the crucial issue, as it must be in cases of this kind, prejudice makes conviction inevitable except in the rarest circumstances. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 340]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nSince the Court proceeds on the assumption that the statutory provisions involved are valid, however, I feel free to express my views about the issues it considers.\n\nFirst. - I agree with Part I of the Court's opinion that deals with the statutory term, \"organize,\" and holds that the organizing charge in the indictment was barred by the three-year statute of limitations.\n\nSecond. - I also agree with the Court insofar as it holds that the trial judge erred in instructing that persons could be punished under the Smith Act for teaching and advocating forceful overthrow as an abstract principle. But on the other hand, I cannot agree that the instruction which the Court indicates it might approve is constitutionally permissible. The Court says that persons can be punished for advocating action to overthrow the Government by force and violence, where those to whom the advocacy is addressed are urged \"to do something, now or in the future, rather than merely to believe in something.\" Under the Court's approach, defendants could still be convicted simply for agreeing to talk as distinguished from agreeing to act. I believe that the First Amendment forbids Congress to punish people for talking about public affairs, whether or not such discussion incites to action, legal or illegal. See Meiklejohn, Free Speech and Its Relation to Self-Government. Cf. Chafee, Book Review, 62 Harv. L. Rev. 891. As the Virginia Assembly said in 1785, in its \"Statute for Religious Liberty,\" written by Thomas Jefferson, \"it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government, for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order. . . .\"\n*\n Cf. Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490, 501\n-502; Labor \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 341]\n\u00a0\n Board v. Virginia Electric & P. Co., \n314 \nU.S. 469, 476\n-480; Virginia Electric & P. Co. v. Labor Board, \n319 \nU.S. 533, 539\n.\n\nThird. - I also agree with the Court that petitioners, Connelly, Kusnitz, Richmond, Spector, and Steinberg, should be ordered acquitted since there is no evidence that they have ever engaged in anything but \"wholly lawful activities.\" But in contrast to the Court, I think the same action should also be taken as to the remaining nine defendants. The Court's opinion summarizes the strongest evidence offered against these defendants. This summary reveals a pitiful inadequacy of proof to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty of conspiring to incite persons to act to overthrow the Government. The Court says:\n\n\"In short, while the record contains evidence of little more than a general program of educational activity by the Communist Party which included advocacy of violence as a theoretical matter, we are not prepared to say, at this stage of the case, that it would be impossible for a jury, resolving all conflicts in favor of the Government and giving the evidence as to these San Francisco and Los Angeles episodes its utmost sweep, to find that advocacy of action was also engaged in when the group involved was thought particularly trustworthy, dedicated, and suited for violent tasks.\"\n\n\n It seems unjust to compel these nine defendants, who have just been through one four-month trial, to go through the ordeal of another trial on the basis of such flimsy evidence. As the Court's summary demonstrates, the evidence introduced during the trial against these defendants was insufficient to support their conviction. Under such circumstances, it was the duty of the trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal. If the jury had \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 342]\n\u00a0\n been discharged so that the Government could gather additional evidence in an attempt to convict, such a discharge would have been a sound basis for a plea of former jeopardy in a second trial. See Wade v. Hunter, \n336 \nU.S. 684\n, and cases cited there. I cannot agree that \"justice\" requires this Court to send these cases back to put these defendants in jeopardy again in violation of the spirit if not the letter of the Fifth Amendment's provision against double jeopardy.\n\nFourth. - The section under which this conspiracy indictment was brought, 18 U.S.C. 371, requires proof of an overt act done \"to effect the object of the conspiracy.\" Originally, 11 such overt acts were charged here. These 11 have now dwindled to 2, and as the Court says:\n\n\"Each was a public meeting held under Party auspices at which speeches were made by one or more of the petitioners extolling leaders of the Soviet Union and criticizing various aspects of the foreign policy of the United States. At one of the meetings an appeal for funds was made. Petitioners contend that these meetings do not satisfy the requirement of the statute that there be shown an act done by one of the conspirators `to effect the object of the conspiracy.' The Government concedes that nothing unlawful was shown to have been said or done at these meetings, but contends that these occurrences nonetheless sufficed as overt acts under the jury's findings.\"\n\n\n The Court holds that attendance at these lawful and orderly meetings constitutes an \"overt act\" sufficient to meet the statutory requirements. I disagree.\n\nThe requirement of proof of an overt act in conspiracy cases is no mere formality, particularly in prosecutions like these which in many respects are akin to trials for treason. Article III, 3, of the Constitution provides \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 343]\n\u00a0\n that \"No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\" One of the objects of this provision was to keep people from being convicted of disloyalty to government during periods of excitement when passions and prejudices ran high, merely because they expressed \"unacceptable\" views. See Cramer v. United States, \n325 \nU.S. 1, 48\n. The same reasons that make proof of overt acts so important in treason cases apply here. The only overt act which is now charged against these defendants is that they went to a constitutionally protected public assembly where they took part in lawful discussion of public questions, and where neither they nor anyone else advocated or suggested overthrow of the United States Government. Many years ago this Court said that \"The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances.\" United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 \nU.S. 542, 552\n. And see De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353, 364\n-365. In my judgment defendants' attendance at these public meetings cannot be viewed as an overt act to effectuate the object of the conspiracy charged.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nIn essence, petitioners were tried upon the charge that they believe in and want to foist upon this country a different and to us a despicable form of authoritarian government in which voices criticizing the existing order are summarily silenced. I fear that the present type of prosecutions are more in line with the philosophy of authoritarian government than with that expressed by our First Amendment.\n\nDoubtlessly, dictators have to stamp out causes and beliefs which they deem subversive to their evil regimes. \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 344]\n\u00a0\n But governmental suppression of causes and beliefs seems to me to be the very antithesis of what our Constitution stands for. The choice expressed in the First Amendment in favor of free expression was made against a turbulent background by men such as Jefferson, Madison, and Mason - men who believed that loyalty to the provisions of this Amendment was the best way to assure a long life for this new nation and its Government. Unless there is complete freedom for expression of all ideas, whether we like them or not, concerning the way government should be run and who shall run it, I doubt if any views in the long run can be secured against the censor. The First Amendment provides the only kind of security system that can preserve a free government - one that leaves the way wide open for people to favor, discuss, advocate, or incite causes and doctrines however obnoxious and antagonistic such views may be to the rest of us.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] 12 Hening's Stat. (Virginia 1823), c. 34, p. 85.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nThe petitioners, principal organizers and leaders of the Communist Party in California, have been convicted for a conspiracy covering the period 1940 to 1951. They were engaged in this conspiracy with the defendants in Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n (1951). The Dennis defendants, named as co-conspirators but not indicted with the defendants here, were convicted in New York under the former conspiracy provisions of the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 671, 18 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 11. They have served or are now serving prison terms as a result of their convictions.\n\nThe conspiracy charged here is the same as in Dennis, except that here it is geared to California conditions, and brought, for the period 1948 to 1951, under the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 371, rather than the old conspiracy section of the Smith Act. The indictment \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 345]\n\u00a0\n charges petitioners with a conspiracy to violate two sections of the Smith Act, as recodified in 18 U.S.C. 2385, by knowingly and wilfully (1) teaching and advocating the violent overthrow of the Government of the United States, and (2) organizing in California through the creation of groups, cells, schools, assemblies of persons, and the like, the Communist Party, a society which teaches or advocates violent overthrow of the Government.\n\nThe conspiracy includes the same group of defendants as in the Dennis case though petitioners here occupied a lower echelon in the party hierarchy. They, nevertheless, served in the same army and were engaged in the same mission. The convictions here were based upon evidence closely paralleling that adduced in Dennis and in United States v. Flynn, 216 F.2d 354 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1954), both of which resulted in convictions. This Court laid down in Dennis the principles governing such prosecutions and they were closely adhered to here, although the nature of the two cases did not permit identical handling.\n\nI would affirm the convictions. However, the Court has freed five of the convicted petitioners and ordered new trials for the remaining nine. As to the five, it says that the evidence is \"clearly insufficient.\" I agree with the Court of Appeals, the District Court, and the jury that the evidence showed guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n1\n It paralleled that in Dennis and Flynn and was \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 346]\n\u00a0\n equally as strong. In any event, this Court should not acquit anyone here. In its long history I find no case in which an acquittal has been ordered by this Court solely on the facts. It is somewhat late to start in now usurping the function of the jury, especially where new trials are to be held covering the same charges. It may be - although after today's opinion it is somewhat doubtful - that under the new theories announced by the Court \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 347]\n\u00a0\n for Smith Act prosecutions sufficient evidence might be available on remand. To say the least, the Government should have an opportunity to present its evidence under these changed conditions.\n\nI cannot agree that half of the indictment against the remaining nine petitioners should be quashed as barred by the statute of limitations. I agree with my Brother BURTON that the Court has incorrectly interpreted the \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 348]\n\u00a0\n term \"organize\" as used in the Smith Act. The Court concludes that the plain words of the Act,\n2\n \"Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons\" (emphasis added) embodies only those \"acts entering into the creation of a new organization.\" As applied to the Communist Party, the Court holds that it refers only to the reconstitution of the Party in 1945 and a part of the prosecution here is, therefore, barred by the three-year statute of limitations. This construction frustrates the purpose of the Congress for the Act was passed in 1940 primarily to curb the growing strength and activity of the Party.\n3\n Under such an interpretation all prosecution would have been barred at the very time of the adoption of the Act for the Party was formed in 1919. If the Congress had been concerned with the initial establishment of the Party it would not have used the words \"helps or attempts,\" nor the phrase \"group \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 349]\n\u00a0\n or assembly of persons.\" It was concerned with the new Communist fronts, cells, schools, and other groups, as well as assemblies of persons, which were being created nearly every day under the aegis of the Party to carry on its purposes. This is what the indictment here charges and the proof shows beyond doubt was in fact done. The decision today prevents for all time any prosecution of Party members under this subparagraph of the Act.\n\nWhile the holding of the Court requires a reversal of the case and a retrial, the Court very properly considers the instructions given by the trial judge. I do not agree with the conclusion of the Court regarding the instructions, but I am highly pleased to see that it disposes of this problem so that on the new trial instructions will be given that will at least meet the views of the Court. I have studied the section of the opinion concerning the instructions and frankly its \"artillery of words\" leaves me confused as to why the majority concludes that the charge as given was insufficient. I thought that Dennis merely held that a charge was sufficient where it requires a finding that \"the Party advocates the theory that there is a duty and necessity to overthrow the Government by force and violence. . . . not as a prophetic insight or as a bit of . . . speculation, but as a program for winning adherents and as a policy to be translated into action\" as soon as the circumstances permit. \n341 \nU.S., at 546\n-547 (concurring opinion). I notice however that to the majority\n\n \"The essence of the Dennis holding was that indoctrination  of a group in preparation for future violent  action, as well as exhortation to immediate action,  by advocacy found to be directed to `action for the  accomplishment' of forcible overthrow, to violence  `as a rule or principle of action,' and employing  `language of incitement,' id., at 511-512, is not constitutionally  protected when the group is of sufficient \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 350]\n\u00a0\n  size and cohesiveness, is sufficiently oriented towards  action, and other circumstances are such as reasonably  to justify apprehension that action will occur.\"\n\n\n I have read this statement over and over but do not seem to grasp its meaning for I see no resemblance between it and what the respected Chief Justice wrote in Dennis, nor do I find any such theory in the concurring opinions. As I see it, the trial judge charged in essence all that was required under the Dennis opinions, whether one takes the view of the Chief Justice or of those concurring in the judgment. Apparently what disturbs the Court now is that the trial judge here did not give the Dennis charge although both the prosecution and the defense asked that it be given. Since he refused to grant these requests I suppose the majority feels that there must be some difference between the two charges, else the one that was given in Dennis would have been followed here. While there may be some distinctions between the charges, as I view them they are without material difference. I find, as the majority intimates, that the distinctions are too \"subtle and difficult to grasp.\"\n\nHowever, in view of the fact that the case must be retried, regardless of the disposition made here on the charges, I see no reason to engage in what becomes nothing more than an exercise in semantics with the majority about this phase of the case. Certainly if I had been sitting at the trial I would have given the Dennis charge, not because I consider it any more correct, but simply because it had the stamp of approval of this Court. Perhaps this approach is too practical. But I am sure the trial judge realizes now that practicality often pays.\n\nI should perhaps add that I am in agreement with the Court in its holding that petitioner Schneiderman can find no aid from the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioners Richmond, Connelly, Kusnitz, Steinberg, and Spector are set free. Richmond at the time of his indictment had for many years been the editor-in-chief of the Daily People's World, the official organ of the Party on the West Coast. He had joined the Party in 1931 and received his indoctrination in Communist technique at the offices of the Daily Worker, the official Party paper on the East Coast. In 1937 he was chosen by the Party's Central Committee to be \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 346]\n\u00a0\n managing editor of the Daily People's World and was transferred to California. From 1946 through 1948 he regularly attended secret meetings of the state and county boards of the Party, admission to which was by identification from a special list of Party members prepared by the Party chairman or its security chief. Party strategy was mapped out at \"very secret meetings\" attended by Richmond and the core of the Party machinery, including at least seven of the petitioners here. Richmond served on a special committee to help develop \"preconvention discussion\" with petitioner Yates; he represented the state committee at the 1950 convention; he addressed many Party meetings preaching the \"vanguard role\" of the Party and the importance of the People's World in the Communist movement; and his articles in the paper urged the \"Leninist and Marxist approach.\" Connelly, a Party member since at least 1938, was the Los Angeles editor of the People's World. During the mobilization effort early in World War II he devoted his efforts to \"building up sentiment against . . . the war effort\" among steel, aircraft, and shipyard workers. He attended the same secret meetings attended by Richmond. There can be no question that the proof sustained the charges against Richmond and Connelly in the conspiracy. Their newspaper was the conduit through which the Party announced its aims, policies, and decisions, sought its funds, and recruited its members. It is the height of naivete to claim that the People's World does not publish appeals to its readers to follow Party doctrine in seeking the overthrow of the Government by force, but it is stark reality to conclude that such a publication provides an incomparable means of promoting the Party's aim of forcible seizure when the time is ripe. Petitioner Spector has been active in the California Party since the early 1930's. He taught \"Marxism-Leninism\" in Party schools \n\n[354 \nU.S. 298, 347]\n\u00a0\n and was \"division organizer\" in Los Angeles County. He attended \"underground meetings\" with petitioners Lambert, Dobbs, Healy, Carlson, and Schneiderman. The witness Rosser testified that these meetings were \"so hid that you couldn't get to them unless you were invited and taken there.\" In 1946 he \"conducted classes\" for Party members in Hollywood, and in 1947 as a member of a committee of three Party officials examined the witness Russell, a student in one of his classes, on charges of being a Party \"police spy.\" Petitioner Kusnitz, following an organizational indoctrination period in New York City, became a Party leader in California in 1946, served as \"section organizer,\" and later as \"organizational secretary\" in Los Angeles. Her position was directly below that of the local chairman in Party hierarchy. She attended many secret meetings and was present at a Party meeting with petitioner Yates when Yates advocated the necessity of \"Soviet support\" and \"Marxist-Leninist training\" as a means of bringing about the Soviet \"type of government . . . all over the world.\" She contributed articles to Communist publications and was very active in the \"regrouping of . . . clubs into smaller units\"; conducting a \"six session leadership training seminar\"; carrying on campaigns for subscriptions to the People's World; and leading the \"Party Building drive\" for the recruitment of members. Petitioner Henry Steinberg, active in the Young Communist League, and associated with the Party since 1936, was the \"educational director.\" He took part in the creation of the program for the Party's training schools in Los Angeles County. His \"education department\" sponsored several meetings, one honoring the 25th anniversary of the death of Lenin. He worked with petitioner Schneiderman, the Party Chairman in California, attended meetings regularly, was active in circulation drives for the People's World, and was the principal speaker at many meetings.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 18 U.S.C. 2385.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Congressman McCormack's remarks on the floor of the House of Representatives on July 29, 1939, during the debate on the Smith Act reflect the underlying purpose behind that Act. He stated, inter alia: \"We all know that the Communist movement has as its ultimate objective the overthrow of government by force and violence or by any means, legal or illegal, or a combination of both. That testimony was indisputably produced before the special committee of which I was chairman, and came from the lips not of those who gave hearsay testimony, but of the actual official records of the Communist Party of the United States, presented to our committee by the executive secretary of the Communist Party and the leader of the Communist Party in the United States, Earl Browder. . . . Therefore, a Communist is one who intends knowingly or willfully to participate in any actions, legal or illegal, or a combination of both, that will bring about the ultimate overthrow of our Government. He is the one we are aiming at . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) 84 Cong. Rec. 10454. See also Hearings before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on the Judiciary on H.

UNITED STATES(1957)\nNo. 2\nArgued: October 22, 1957Decided: November 25, 1957\n\n\n\n\n In the trial of petitioner and 13 codefendants for conspiracy to violate the Smith Act, petitioner testified in her own defense after the Government and all but four defendants had rested their cases. On the first day of her cross-examination, she refused to answer four questions about the Communist membership of a nondefendant and a codefendant who had rested his case, indicating that she would refuse to identify other persons as members of the Communist Party. For this she was imprisoned for civil contempt. On the third day of her cross-examination, she refused to answer 11 similar questions, stating that she would not identify others as Communists if to do so would hurt them or their families. The judge notified her at the time that he would treat these 11 refusals to answer as criminal contempts; and, after the close of the conspiracy trial, he found her guilty of 11 separate criminal contempts and sentenced her to imprisonment for one year on each, the sentences to run concurrently. In doing so he stated that, if she would answer the questions within 60 days, he would be inclined to accept her submission to the court's authority; but petitioner persisted in her refusal. Held:\n\n 1. The latter sentences were not for civil contempt, for the purpose of coercing answers to questions; they were for criminal contempt, to vindicate the authority of the court. P. 72.\n\n\n 2. Petitioner was guilty of only one criminal contempt by her refusals to answer on the third day of her cross-examination; and punishment for that was not barred by the fact that she had been imprisoned for civil contempt for her refusals to answer on the first day of her cross-examination.

Pp. 73-74.\n\n\n (c) However, her refusal to answer on the third day of her cross-examination was a continuance of her defiance of the court's authority, and it subjected her to a conviction for criminal contempt.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case is one of criminal contempt for refusal to answer questions at trial. Petitioner, admittedly a high executive officer of the Communist Party of California, and 13 codefendants were indicted and convicted of conspiracy to violate the Smith Act.\n1\n During the trial, petitioner \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 68]\n\u00a0\n refused on June 30, 1952, to answer 11 questions relating to whether persons other than herself were members of the Communist Party. The District Court held petitioner in contempt of court for each refusal to answer, and imposed 11 concurrent sentences of one year each, which were to commence upon petitioner's release from custody following execution of the five-year sentence imposed in the conspiracy case. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 227 F.2d 851. We granted certiorari. \n350 \nU.S. 947\n. The principal question presented is whether the finding of a separate contempt for each refusal constitutes an improper multiplication of contempts. We hold that it does, and find that only one contempt has been committed.\n\nThe circumstances of petitioner's conviction are these. After the Government had rested its case in the Smith Act trial, all but four of the defendants - petitioner and three others - rested their cases. Petitioner took the stand and testified in her own defense. During the afternoon of the first day of her cross-examination, June 26, 1952, she refused to answer four questions about the Communist membership of a nondefendant and of a codefendant who had rested his case.\n2\n In refusing to answer, she stated, \". . . [T]hat is a question which, if I were to answer, could only lead to a situation in which a person could be caused to suffer the loss of his job. . . and perhaps be subjected to further harassment, and . . . I cannot bring myself to contribute to that.\" She added, \"However many times I am asked and in however many forms, to identify a person as a communist, I can't bring myself to do it . . . .\" The District Court adjudged her guilty of civil contempt for refusing to answer these questions, \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n and committed her to jail until she should purge herself by answering the questions or until further order of the court. She was confined for the remainder of the trial.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nOn the third day of petitioner's cross-examination, June 30, 1952, despite instructions from the court to answer, petitioner refused to answer 11 questions which in one way or another called for her to identify nine other persons as Communists. The stated ground for refusal in these instances was petitioner's belief that either the person named or his family could \"be hurt by\" such testimony. She expressed a willingness to identify others as Communists - and in one instance did so - if such identification would not hurt them. The judge stated that he expected to treat these 11 refusals as criminal contempt under Rule 42 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n4\n Adjudication of the contempt was deferred until completion of the principal case. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter conviction and imposition of sentences in the conspiracy case, the court, acting under 18 U.S.C. 401,\n5\n found petitioner guilty of \"eleven separate criminal contempts\" for her 11 refusals to answer questions on June 30. No question is raised as to the form or content of the specifications.\n\nThe court sentenced petitioner to imprisonment for one year on each of the 11 separate specifications of criminal contempt. The sentences were to run concurrently and were to commence upon her release from custody following execution of the five-year sentence imposed on the conspiracy charge. Upon imposing sentence, the court stated that if petitioner answered the 11 questions then or within 60 days, while he had authority to modify the sentence under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, he would be inclined to accept her submission to the authority of the court. However, petitioner persisted in her refusal.\n\nThe summary contempt power in the federal courts, \". . . although arbitrary in its nature and liable to abuse, is absolutely essential to the protection of the courts in the discharge of their functions. Without it, judicial tribunals would be at the mercy of the disorderly and violent, who respect neither the laws enacted for the vindication of public and private rights, nor the officers \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 71]\n\u00a0\n charged with the duty of administering them.\" Ex parte Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289, 313\n (1888). The Judiciary Act of 1789 contained a section making it explicit that federal courts could \"punish by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of said courts, all contempts of authority in any cause or hearing before the same . . . .\" 1 Stat. 73, 83. After United States District Judge Peck's acquittal in 1831\n6\n on charges of high misdemeanors for summarily punishing a member of the bar for contempt in publishing a critical comment on one of his judgments, Congress modified the statute. In the Act of 1831, the contempt power was limited to specific situations such as disobedience to lawful orders. 4 Stat. 487. See Frankfurter and Landis, Power of Congress Over Procedure in Criminal Contempts in \"Inferior\" Federal Courts, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 1010, 1023-1038. The present code provision is substantially similar.\n7\n We have no doubt that the refusals in question constituted contempt within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 401 (3).\n\nThis case presents three issues. Petitioner claims that the sentences were imposed to coerce her into answering the questions instead of to punish her, making the contempts civil rather than criminal and the sentences to a prison term after the close of the trial a violation of Fifth Amendment due process. Second, petitioner argues that her several refusals to answer on both June 26 and June 30 constituted but a single contempt which was total and complete on June 26, so that imposition of contempt sentences for the June 30 refusals was in violation of due process. Finally, petitioner contends that her one-year sentences were so severe as to violate due process and constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 72]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWhile imprisonment cannot be used to coerce evidence after a trial has terminated, Yates v. United States, 227 F.2d 844; cf. Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 443\n, 449 (1911), it is unquestioned that imprisonment for a definite term may be imposed to punish the contemnor in vindication of the authority of the court. We do not believe that the sentences under review in this case were imposed for the purpose of coercing answers to the 11 questions. Rather, the record clearly shows that the order was made to \"vindicate the authority of the court\" by punishing petitioner's \"defiance\" thereof. The sentencing judge did express the hope that petitioner would still \"purge herself to the extent that she bows to the authority of the court\" by answering the questions either at the time of the sentencing or within 60 days thereafter. In doing so, however, he acted pursuant to the power of the court under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n8\n rather than under any theory of civil contempt. Indeed, in express negation of the latter idea, he stated that should she answer the questions, \"[i]t could have no effect upon this proceeding and need not be accepted as a purge, because of the fact that the time has passed . . . for the administration of justice in this case to be affected by it.\"\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nPetitioner contends that the refusals of June 26 and June 30 constituted no more than a single contempt because the questions asked all related to identification of others as Communists, after she made it clear on June 26 that she would not be an informer. She urges \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 73]\n\u00a0\n that the single contempt was completed on June 26 since the area of refusal was \"carved out\" on that day. From this, petitioner concludes that no contempt was committed on June 30 and that imposition of criminal contempt sentences for refusals of that day to answer violates due process guaranties.\n\nA witness, of course, cannot \"pick and choose\" the questions to which an answer will be given. The management of the trial rests with the judge and no party can be permitted to usurp that function. See United States v. Gates, 176 F.2d 78, 80. However, it is equally clear that the prosecution cannot multiply contempts by repeated questioning on the same subject of inquiry within which a recalcitrant witness already has refused answers. See United States v. Orman, 207 F.2d 148.\n\nEven though we assume the Government correct in its contention that the 11 questions in this case covered more than a single subject of inquiry, it appears that every question fell within the area of refusal established by petitioner on the first day of her cross-examination. The Government admits, pursuant to the holding of United States v. Costello, 198 F.2d 200, that only one contempt would result if Mrs. Yates had flatly refused on June 26 to answer any questions and had maintained such a position. We deem it a fortiori true that where a witness draws the lines of refusal in less sweeping fashion by declining to answer questions within a generally defined area of interrogation, the prosecutor cannot multiply contempts by further questions within that area. The policy of the law must be to encourage testimony; a witness willing to testify freely as to all areas of investigation but one, should not be subject to more numerous charges of contempt than a witness unwilling to give any testimony at all.\n\nHaving once carved out an area of refusal, petitioner remained within its boundaries in all her subsequent \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 74]\n\u00a0\n refusals. The slight modification on June 30 of the area of refusal did not carry beyond the boundaries already established. Whereas on June 26 the witness refused to identify other persons as Communists, on June 30 she refused to do so only if those persons would be hurt by her identification. Although the latter basis is not identical to the former, the area of refusal set out by it necessarily fell within the limits drawn on June 26. We agree with petitioner that only one contempt is shown on the facts of this case.\n\nThat conclusion, however, does not establish petitioner's contention that no contempt whatsoever was committed by her refusal to answer the 11 questions of June 30. The contempt of this case, although single, was of a continuing nature: each refusal on June 30 continued the witness' defiance of proper authority. Certainly a party who persisted in refusing to perform specific acts required by a mandatory injunction would be in continuing contempt of court. We see no meaningful distinction between that situation and petitioner's persistent refusal to answer questions within a defined area.\n\nThough there was but one contempt, imposition of the civil sentence for the refusals of June 26 is no barrier to criminal punishment for the refusals of June 30. The civil and criminal sentences served distinct purposes, the one coercive, the other punitive and deterrent; that the same act may give rise to these distinct sanctions presents no double jeopardy problem. Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 148, 150\n (1956); United States v. United Mine Workers, \n330 \nU.S. 258, 299\n (1947).\n9\n Clearly, if \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 75]\n\u00a0\n the civil and criminal sentences could have been imposed simultaneously by the court on June 26, as the United Mine Workers case holds, it scarcely can be argued that the court's failure to invoke the criminal sanction until June 30 was fatal to its criminal contempt powers. Indeed, the more salutary procedure would appear to be that a court should first apply coercive remedies in an effort to persuade a party to obey its orders, and only make use of the more drastic criminal sanctions when the disobedience continues. Had the court imposed a civil sentence and found petitioner guilty of criminal contempt on June 26, it could have postponed imposition of a criminal sentence until termination of the principal case. The distinction between that procedure and the one followed here is entirely formal.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nWhile the sentences imposed were concurrent, it may be that the court's judgment as to the proper penalty was affected by the view that petitioner had committed 11 separate contempts. In addition, petitioner has now served a total of over 70 days in jail awaiting final disposition of the several proceedings against her. The conspiracy conviction and another criminal contempt conviction have been reversed, and the sentences imposed here have been termed \"severe\" by the Court of Appeals. 227 F.2d 851, 855. Moreover, the court should consider \". . . the extent of the willful and deliberate defiance of the court's order [and] the seriousness of the consequences of the contumacious behaviour . . . .\" United States v. United Mine Workers, supra, at 303. In this regard, petitioner's understandable reluctance to be an informer, although legally insufficient to explain her refusals to answer, is a factor, as is her apparently courteous demeanor and the fact that her refusals seem to have had no perceptible effect on the outcome of the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 76]\n\u00a0\n trial. All of this points up the necessity, we think, of having the trial judge reconsider the sentence in the cool reflection of subsequent events.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThe contempt convictions on specifications II-XI, inclusive, are reversed. The contempt conviction on specification I is affirmed, but the sentence on that conviction is vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court for resentencing in the light of this opinion.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BURTON agrees with the Court of Appeals and the trial court that petitioner's refusals to answer when ordered to do so by the trial court on June 30 constituted at least nine contempts of court. However, in view of all the circumstances, he now joins in the judgment of this Court remanding the case for resentencing.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This Court reversed the convictions in the principal case. Yates v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 298\n (1957).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] At the morning session petitioner indicated that she would answer questions as to the Party membership of codefendants who had not rested their cases, and in fact she did so.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The trial ended on Aug. 5, 1952. Petitioner was confined under the judgment of conviction in the principal case until Aug. 30, 1952, when she was released on bail pending appeal in that case. She was reconfined on Sept. 4, 1952, this time under the civil contempt order of June 26. She was released on bail on Sept. 6, 1952, pending appeal from the order directing her reconfinement. That order was reversed on appeal on the ground that petitioner could not purge herself of the civil contempt since the trial had ended. Yates v. United States, 227 F.2d 844. Petitioner was again confined on Sept. 8, 1952, after the District Court, on that same day, adjudged her in criminal contempt of court for her June 26 refusals to answer. She was released on bail on Sept. 11, 1952, pending appeal from that judgment, which was later reversed on appeal because the district judge had given her no notice at the time of the trial that he expected to hold her in criminal contempt for the June 26 refusals. Yates v. United States, 227 F.2d 848. Neither the civil nor the criminal contempt sentences for the June 26 refusals, nor their reversals, are under review in the present case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"A criminal contempt may be punished summarily if the judge certifies that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court. The order of contempt shall recite the facts and shall be signed by the judge and entered of record.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \" 401. POWER OF COURT.\n\n\"A court of the United States shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none other, as -\n\n\n\"(1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice;\n\n\n\"(2) Misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions;\n\n\n\"(3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Stansbury, Report of the Trial of James H.

The court may reduce a sentence within 60 days after the sentence is imposed. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Nor does the finding of a single contempt mean that the criminal contempt sentence under review in this case constitutes double jeopardy because the court also imposed a criminal contempt sentence for the June 26 refusals. The latter was reversed on appeal, note 3, supra, and in any event was imposed after the criminal contempt sentence for the June 30 refusals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In addition, the sentences imposed were ordered to commence upon completion of the five-year sentence in the conspiracy case. Reversal of the conspiracy conviction has rendered uncertain the date at which the sentences here imposed would begin.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Cf. Nilva v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 385, 396\n (1957).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK concur, dissenting.\n\nThis case to me is a shocking instance of the abuse of judicial authority. It is without precedent in the books.\n\nMrs. Yates, not wanting to be an informer, refused on cross-examination to answer four questions concerning the Communist Party affiliations of any codefendant who had rested his case or any other person who might be subject to persecution by such a disclosure.\n\nFor this, her first refusal, she was given her first sentence and confined in jail for 70 days.\n1\n On the third \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 77]\n\u00a0\n day of her cross-examination she was asked 11 more questions along the same line and, adhering to her original position, remained adamant in her refusal to answer. The district judge told Mrs. Yates that he intended to treat her refusals to answer as 11 separate criminal contempts, but indicated that he would defer action on the criminal contempt for the second refusal for the duration of the trial. The conviction for criminal contempt because of her second refusal to testify was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (227 F.2d 851) and is now affirmed by this Court.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nFirst. One reason I would reverse is that this is a transparent attempt to multiply offenses. The one offense which Mrs. Yates committed was her first refusal to answer. Her second refusal was merely the maintenance of the same position she took at the start of her cross-examination. I do not think a prosecutor should be allowed to multiply the contempts by repeating the questions. The correct rule, I believe, is stated in United States v. Costello, 198 F.2d 200, 204.\n\n\"Certainly the refusal to testify was an act in contempt of the Committee for which the defendant was subject to the punishment prescribed by the statute. But when the defendant made his position clear, the Committee could not multiply the contempt, and the punishment, by continuing to ask him questions each time eliciting the same answer: his refusal to \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 78]\n\u00a0\n give any testimony. In other words, the contempt was total when he stated that he would not testify, and the refusals thereafter to answer specific questions can not be considered as anything more than expressions of his intention to adhere to his earlier statement and as such were not separately punishable.\"\n\n\n Or, as stated in United States v. Orman, 207 F.2d 148, 160.\n\n \". . . where the separate questions seek to establish but a single fact, or relate to but a single subject of inquiry, only one penalty for contempt may be imposed.\"\n\n\n Any other rule gives the prosecutor and the judge the awful power to create crimes as they choose. Because of the prosecutor's efforts to multiply the offense by continuing the line of questions, Mrs. Yates' second refusal to answer, following consistently the position she had made clear to the court upon the first day of her cross-examination, was not a contempt. Her second refusal to answer was merely a failure to purge\n3\n herself of the first contempt, not a new one. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 79]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSecond. Mrs. Yates might have been subjected to criminal penalties as well as civil coercion for the contempt she committed upon her first refusal to testify. See Penfield Co. v. S. E. C., \n330 \nU.S. 585\n; United States v. United Mine Workers, \n330 \nU.S. 258\n. The district judge in fact attempted to impose a three-year criminal sentence for her first refusal to answer; but he was reversed by the Court of Appeals for his failure to give her the necessary notice during the pendency of the trial. Yates v. United States, 227 F.2d 848.\n\nWhat the Court now does is to make the present conviction do service for the invalid conviction for her first refusal to testify. This cannot be done unless we are to make a rule to fit this case only.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The trial judge was not through with Mrs. Yates. In his view, the first or \"coercive\" civil contempt order remained in effect so long as the judgment of conviction in the main case was pending on \n\n[355 \nU.S. 66, 77]\n\u00a0\n appeal. The Court of Appeals ordered her released (Yates v.

Cf. Offutt v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 11\n. Nor has petitioner contended that she could be held only on indictment by a grand jury, or tried only by a jury, or prosecuted without the other procedural safeguards of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This is apparent from what transpired when Mrs. Yates appeared before the trial judge in this case:\n\n\"I had hoped by this time that Mrs. Yates might be willing to purge herself; that she might be prompted to do so.\"\n\n\n\". . . as I view it, the court, in its discretion, might treat answers now to the questions as a vindication of judicial authority and treat it as purged.\"\n\n\n\"I take it from the defendant's statement that she is as adamant now as she was the day the questions were put.\"\n\n\n\"I hope Mrs. Yates will yet purge herself.

RAINFAIR, INC.(1957)\nNo. 11\nArgued: October 15, 1957Decided: December 9, 1957\n\n\n\n\n Respondent, a manufacturer engaged in interstate commerce and whose employees were entitled to the protection of the National Labor Relations Act, operated a branch plant in an essentially rural community of about 4,000 inhabitants. The plant had about 100 employees, none of whom were members of a labor union but many of whom had signed applications to join a union. Apparently in an effort to compel respondent to recognize the union as the bargaining agent of the employees, some of the employees struck and picketed the plant. The picketing was accompanied by massed name-calling, threats, and other conduct calculated to intimidate the officers, agents and nonstriking employees of the plant. A state court enjoined not only the threatening, intimidating or coercing of employees of the plant but also all \"picketing or patrolling\" of the plant premises. Held:\n\n 1. The evidence supports the conclusion of the trial court, affirmed by the State Supreme Court, that the conduct and massed name-calling by petitioners were calculated to provoke violence and were likely to do so unless promptly restrained; and such conduct and abusive language in such circumstances can be enjoined. Pp. 138-139.\n\n\n 2. However, the trial court unlawfully entered the pre-empted domain of the National Labor Relations Board insofar as it enjoined peaceful picketing P. 139.\n\n\n 3. Insofar as the injunction prohibits petitioners and others cooperating with them from threatening violence, or provoking violence on the part of any of the officers, agents or employees of respondent, and prohibits them from obstructing or attempting to obstruct the free use of the streets adjacent to respondent's place of business, and the free ingress and egress to and from the property, it is affirmed. P. 139.\n\n\n 4. To the extent that the injunction prohibits all other picketing and patrolling of respondent's premises and in particular prohibits peaceful picketing, it is set aside. Pp. 139-140.\n\n\n 226 Ark. 80, 288 S. W. 2d 589, affirmed in part, reversed in part; judgment vacated and cause remanded. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 131, 132]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWilliam J. Isaacson argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief were Sidney S. McMath, Leland F. Leatherman and Henry Woods.\n\nJ. L. Shaver, Sr. argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe issues here are whether, under the circumstances of this case, a state court may enjoin strikers and union representatives from (1) \"threatening, intimidating or coercing any of the officers, agents or employees of [the employer] at any place,\" and also \"from obstructing, or attempting to obstruct the free use of the streets adjacent to [the employer's] place of business, and the free ingress and egress to and from [the employer's property,\" and (2) all \"picketing or patrolling\" of the employer's premises. For reasons hereafter stated, we conclude that the state court may lawfully enjoin conduct of substantially the first category but not of the second.\n\nMost of the material facts are uncontroverted. In 1955, respondent, Rainfair, Inc., was a Wisconsin corporation with headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin. It owned and operated a plant in Wynne, Arkansas, an essentially rural community of about 4,000 inhabitants. About 100 women and seven men were there employed in the manufacture of men's slacks which were shipped in interstate commerce. None of the employees were members of a labor union but many had signed applications to join the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, CIO, which is one of the petitioners.\n\nApparently in an effort to compel the employer to recognize the union as the bargaining agent of the employees, 29 of the employees did not report for work on May 2, 1955. A picket line was established on the street in front of the plant. Strike headquarters were \n\n[355 \nU.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n maintained across the street from the plant entrance. Nearly all of the strikers were women. Their number varied from eight to 37. All was not quiet, however. On one occasion nails were strewn over the company's parking lot and, about a week later, the whole lot was \"seeded\" with roofing tacks. Tacks were also scattered in the driveway of the plant manager's home and on the driveways of 12 of the nonstriking women employees. One of the pickets told the plant manager that she would \"wipe the sidewalk\" with him and send him back to Wisconsin because he \"was nothing but trash.\" The plant manager was followed by the strikers each time he left the plant; he also was harassed at night by occasional shouting at his home and by numerous anonymous telephone calls.\n\nImmediately after the strike was called, respondent, by registered mail, informed each of the strikers that, if they did not return to work within a few days, the company would assume that those not returning had quit their jobs. Only three returned. Thirteen new employees were hired. The strike ended on May 19, the pickets were withdrawn and the strikers applied for reinstatement. Respondent, however, declined to arrange for immediate reinstatement. On June 17, the strikers voted to re-establish the picket line on Monday, June 20.\n1\n The purpose was to protest against respondent's failure to recognize the union and its refusal to reinstate the employees who had applied for reinstatement in May. \n\n[355 \nU.S. 131, 134]\n\u00a0\n\n\nShortly after midnight, on the morning of June 20, two women strikers deliberately drove a sharp instrument into two tires of a car owned by the daughter of one of the nonstriking women employees.\n2\n At about 5:15 a. m. the police were summoned to the plant where they found a five-foot black snake inside the plant beneath a broken window. At about 6 a. m. picketing was resumed.\n3\n Although the union posted notices warning the strikers against committing acts of violence, a union representative later was sufficiently concerned to ask the police to have someone regularly on duty at the entrance to the plant. The evidence shows that the tension was in large part caused by the enormous amount of abusive language hurled by the strikers at the company employees. The Supreme Court of Arkansas later summarized this as follows:\n\n\"As the employees would go to and from work at the plant, or go to lunch, or take a recess, the strikers would congregate along the west edge of their lot and sometimes in Rowena Street and engage in loud and offensive name calling, singing or shouting directed at the workers. They would call the workers `scabs,' `dirty scabs,' `fat scabs,' `yellow scabs,' `crazy scabs,' `cotton patch scabs,' `pony tailed scabs,' `fuzzy headed scabs,' `fools,' `cotton picking fools,' and other similar names. This took place every time an employee left or entered the plant. It was done by the strikers individually, in couples or by the entire group and in a loud and boisterous manner. One witness described it as `just bedlam' when more than a dozen joined in the shouting. Particular \n\n[355 \nU.S. 131, 135]\n\u00a0\n names or remarks were reserved for individual workers. One pregnant worker was greeted with, `Get the hot water ready,' or, `I am coming to make another payment on the baby, call Dr. Beaton,' or, `Why, you can work another hour until you go to the delivery room.' This worker and another drove to a filling station for gasoline when two of the strikers drove up and told the attendant not to wait on `these scabs' before he waited on the strikers.\n\n\n \"One worker said the strikers always called her `fat scab,' and that individual pickets and strikers made fun of her clothing and asked her if `Pete,' the plant manager, still liked her `low-cut dresses and earrings.' This made the employee so angry she invited the picket to come over and `make it some of her business.'. . .\n\n\n \"The strikers sang songs with improvised lyrics to the tune of certain popular ballads and religious and Union songs. `When The Saints Go Marching In' became `When The Scabs Go Marching In' and the ballad, `Davy Crockett,' began, `Born in a cotton patch in Arkansas, the greenest gals we ever saw . . . .'\n\n\n \"The women pickets would stand in the street or sit near the plant and shout ugly names, stick out their tongues, hold their noses and make a variety of indecent gestures while pointing at the workers in the plant. Several workers testified the continuous name calling and boisterous conduct of the strikers made them afraid, angry, ill or nervous and had an adverse effect on their ability to properly do their work. Some of the workers would talk back to the strikers while others remained silent. The Chief of Police of Wynne testified there was more tension during the second picketing than the first and that he was fearful there was going to be trouble \n\n[355 \nU.S. 131, 136]\n\u00a0\n during the second picketing and so informed Union staff members. One staff member called him once when trouble seemed imminent and wanted to `go on record' as having requested the presence of the officer.\" 226 Ark. 80, 83-84, 288 S. W. 2d 589, 591.\n\n\n On June 24, respondent filed a complaint in the local Chancery Court. It described the conduct of the strikers and alleged that such conduct amounted to \"unlawful acts . . . for the unlawful purpose of intimidating and coercing\" respondent's employees into joining the union, that respondent had no adequate remedy at law and that it was suffering irreparable damage from such conduct. The court acted upon the complaint and the testimony of the plant manager and issued a temporary injunction. After full hearing, it made the injunction permanent on September 15. The trial court's findings included the following statement:\n\n \"That the defendants, in picketing the plaintiff's plant, have resorted to violence, coercion and intimidation, and such other unlawful conduct as was calculated to cause a breach of the peace, and that the defendants have unlawfully abused the right to peaceably picket, as granted to them by the laws of this state and the Federal Constitution, and that said defendants should be permanently enjoined from picketing the plaintiff's plant.\"\n\n\n The permanent decree enjoined not only the threatening and intimidation of the employees of respondent at any place, but also all picketing or patrolling of respondent's premises by the named defendants and all other persons in sympathy or acting in concert with them.\n4\n The \n\n[355 \nU.S. 131, 137]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed the decree. 226 Ark. 80, 288 S. W. 2d 589. We granted certiorari largely because of the sweeping language of the decree. \n352 \nU.S. 822\n.\n\nThe applicable principles of law are substantially agreed upon. Respondent concedes that it is engaged in interstate commerce and that its employees are entitled to the protection of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C. 151. Respondent does not contend that the state court had power to enjoin peaceful organized activity, recognizing that generally the \n\n[355 \nU.S. 131, 138]\n\u00a0\n National Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction of such matters. Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468\n. Petitioners concede that the state court had the power to enjoin violence. Auto Workers v. Wisconsin Board, \n351 \nU.S. 266\n; Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Board, \n315 \nU.S. 740\n. Respondent contends that the record here shows a pattern of violence so enmeshed in the picketing that, to restore order, it was necessary to enjoin all organized conduct. Petitioners, on the other hand, urge that there was no violence here and no threat of it and, accordingly, that there was no factual warrant for the injunction which issued.\n\nThe issue here is whether or not the conduct and language of the strikers were likely to cause physical violence. Petitioners urge that all of this abusive language was protected and that they could not, therefore, be enjoined from using it. We cannot agree. Words can readily be so coupled with conduct as to provoke violence. See Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, \n315 \nU.S. 568, 571\n-572. Petitioners contend that the words used, principally \"scab\" and variations thereon, are within a protected terminology. But if a sufficient number yell any word sufficiently loudly showing an intent to ridicule, insult or annoy, no matter how innocuous the dictionary definition of that word, the effect may cease to be persuasion and become intimidation and incitement to violence.\n5\n Wynne is not an industrial metropolis. When, in a small community, more than 30 people get together and act as they did here, and heap abuse on their neighbors and \n\n[355 \nU.S. 131, 139]\n\u00a0\n former friends, a court is justified in finding that violence is imminent. Recognizing that the trial court was in a better position than we can be to assess the local situation, we think the evidence supports its conclusion, affirmed by the State Supreme Court, that the conduct and massed name-calling by petitioners were calculated to provoke violence and were likely to do so unless promptly restrained.\n\nThough the state court was within its discretionary power in enjoining future acts of violence, intimidation and threats of violence by the strikers and the union, yet it is equally clear that such court entered the pre-empted domain of the National Labor Relations Board insofar as it enjoined peaceful picketing by petitioners. The picketing proper, as contrasted with the activities around the headquarters, was peaceful. There was little, if any, conduct designed to exclude those who desired to return to work. Nor can we say that a pattern of violence was established which would inevitably reappear in the event picketing were later resumed. Cf. Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., \n312 \nU.S. 287\n. What violence there was was scattered in time and much of it was unconnected with the picketing. There is nothing in the record to indicate that an injunction against such conduct would be ineffective if picketing were resumed.\n\nAccordingly, insofar as the injunction before us prohibits petitioners and others cooperating with them from threatening violence against, or provoking violence on the part of, any of the officers, agents or employees of respondent and prohibits them from obstructing or attempting to obstruct the free use of the streets adjacent to respondent's place of business, and the free ingress and egress to and from that property, it is affirmed. On the other hand, to the extent the injunction prohibits all other picketing and patrolling of respondent's premises and in \n\n[355 \nU.S. 131, 140]\n\u00a0\n particular prohibits peaceful picketing, it is set aside. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is vacated and the case is remanded to it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, being of opinion that Congress has given the National Labor Relations Board exclusive jurisdiction of this controversy, would reverse the judgment in its entirety and remand the cause to the state court for dismissal of the injunction.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the meantime the union had filed unfair labor practice charges against respondent before the National Labor Relations Board. These were still pending at the time of the hearing of the instant case. The union also requested the Board to conduct a representation election, but this request was withdrawn before the hearing on the injunction. At an election held on October 19, a majority of the employees of respondent voted not to be represented by the union.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] They later were convicted of this misdemeanor.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The placards were inscribed, \"Rainfair Workers on Strike, Rainfair is unfair to its employees, Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, CIO.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"It is, therefore, considered and decreed by this court that the defendants James E. Youngdahl . . . and each of them, and their agents and employees, and each and every one of the officers and \n\n[355 \nU.S. 131, 137]\n\u00a0\n members of Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, CIO, and all other persons in sympathy, or acting in concert with them, be, and they are hereby permanently enjoined while on, adjacent to, or near plaintiff's premises located on Martin Drive and Rowena Street, in Wynne, Arkansas, from interfering with plaintiff's business, its customers and employees, and from picketing or patrolling, or causing to be picketed or patrolled the plaintiff's premises, and the sidewalks, streets, or other property adjacent to plaintiff's premises, with placards or banners designating said place of business as unfair to organized labor, or with placards otherwise so worded as to give said place of business such designation; that the defendants, and each of them, their agents and employees, and the officers and members of the above-mentioned union, and all sympathizers, and all other persons acting in concert with them, be, and they are hereby restrained and enjoined from accosting and detaining, or causing to be accosted or to be detained on the sidewalks or streets adjacent to or on plaintiff's premises, any person or persons seeking to enter or depart from said place of business for the purpose of dissuading them from patronizing, or working for plaintiff, or from calling attention to any alleged unfairness of plaintiff, or its place of business, to organized labor; from threatening, intimidating or coercing any of the officers, agents or employees of plaintiff at any place; from loitering and congregating around and under the tent and upon the property that is used as the union's headquarters, located directly across Rowena Street in front of plaintiff's premises; and from obstructing, or attempting to obstruct the free use of the streets adjacent to plaintiff's place of business, and the free ingress and egress to and from plaintiff's property.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In Arkansas there was then in effect a statute of long standing which expressly made it a crime for any person to \"make use of any profane, violent, vulgar, abusive or insulting language toward or about any other person in his presence or hearing, which language in its common acceptation is calculated to arouse to anger the person about or to whom it is spoken or addressed, or to cause a breach of the peace or an assault . . . .\" Ark.
