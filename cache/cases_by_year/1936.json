States Supreme Court\nACKER v. UNITED STATES(1936)\nNo. 655\nArgued: Decided: May 18, 1936\n\n\n\n mS.CT825m- \n\n[298 U.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George I. Haight and John S. Boyd, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Mr. John Dickinson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n September 23, 1932, the Secretary of Agriculture, acting under the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921,1 ordered an inquiry and gave notice of a hearing to determine the reasonableness of rates charged by market agencies doing business at the Union Stockyards in Chicago. After protracted hearings and argument, he made findings of fact, announced his conclusion that the existing rates were unreasonable, and fixed new maximum rates. The appellants, who conduct market agencies, petitioned for rehearing. This the secretary denied, but by a supplemental order he increased some rates. An amended petition for rehearing was dismissed and the appellants then filed their bill in the District Court seeking an injunction against enforcement of the original and supplemental orders. The case was heard by three judges, who granted an interlocutory injunction. At final hearing, the appel- \n\n[298 U.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n lants offered in evidence the record of the proceedings before the secretary and also proffered additional testimony which was received over the appellees' objection and subject to their exception. The court dismissed the bill, holding that the secretary's findings were supported by substantial evidence. In the light of the evidence before him, and that adduced at the trial, the court adopted the secretary's findings as its own; adjudged the prescribed rates reasonable, and concluded the orders entered were not arbitrary and did not operate so as to take the agencies' property without due process of law.\n The appellants contended in the court below, and here insist, that the secretary failed to apply the principles for ascertaining reasonable rates approved by this court in Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420\n, 50 S.Ct. 220; improperly invaded the field of management in determining reasonable unit costs; used an improper test period for ascertaining costs; disregarded the evidence in fixing an allowance for salesmenship costs and expense of getting and maintaining business, and arbitrarily denied the petitions for rehearing. These errors, so they claim, resulted in the fixing of unreasonable and confiscatory rates.\n The services performed by commission merchants in the Chicago yards are substantially the same as those described in the opinion in Tagg Bros . & Moorhead v. United States, supra, touching the market agencies at the Omaha stockyards. Little capital is invested; the business is the rendering of personal services for which charges are made according to a uniform schedule. In ascertaining whether the rates are reasonable, the prime factor is the agencies' costs, of which the most important are salesemen's compensation and the expense of getting and maintaining business. The old schedule of rates, like that prescribed for the Omaha yards, and considered in Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra, was \n\n[298 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n based upon carload lots. In the present case the secretary determined that a more accurate and reasonable schedule could be prepared on the basis of the consignment rather than that of the carload. In order to ascertain unit costs it was necessary for him to break down the total costs into three principal items-salaries, other expenses, and interest. These in turn were subdivided thus: Salaries into selling and buying, yarding, business getting and maintaining, office and administrative; other expenses into yarding, office, business geting and maintaining, administrative and general, and risk. Interest was calculated on the value of fixed assets, inventory of supplies, and cash working capital equivalent to one month's expense allowance. Costs were thus determined for each sort of livestock handled. In arriving at the rate, an allowance was made for management and uninsurable risks; that is, for profit. The secretary stated that he adopted the same principles for determining rates as were approved in the Tagg Bros. Case. The complaints against the rates are not directed to these principles, but to their application in the present case. We think they are without merit.\n\n 1. \nIn general, the secretary's findings are challenged as not giving proper weight to the past experience of the market agencies. As the findings demonstrate, full consideration was given to the costs incurred, but in ascertaining a reasonable unit cost as the basis of a uniform rate the secretary was not bound to, and indeed he coul not, adopt any one agency's costs or an average of the costs of all of them; to do so would be to leave out of consideration relative size, relative volume, and relative efficiency of individual agencies.\n\n 2. \nThe attack upon the allowance for salesmen's salaries is bottomed on the fact that the secretary refused to adopt an average of salaries heretofore paid. He was not required so to do. What is a typical salesman's \n\n[298 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n performance, and a fair recompense for it, is a matter of judgment based upon all the facts. That the secretary considered and weighed the evidence is clearly shown by his findings; that he exercised an informed judgment upon it cannot successfully be denied.\n Many proprietors of agencies take part in the activities of buying, selling, yarding, etc. As they own the enterprise, they receive no salaries. Their recompense is the profit realized from the business. What each of them thus earned during the test period was disclosed at the hearing. The appellants insisted that the secretary should in his cost computations fix a salary allowance for such owners without reference to their actual earnings. In order to furnish a basis for a finding in this behalf, they procured independent persons, said to have knowledge of the subject, to make appraisals of the value of the services of these owners and introduced the appraisals in evidence. They insist that because the secretary, in arriving at selling costs, ignored these hypothetical salaries, his action was arbitrary and unreasonable. We cannot so hold. We think it evident that he was justified in considering conditions as he found them and refusing to load the business with a cost having no relation to actualities.\n\n 3. \nWith respect to the cost of getting and maintaining business, the secretary had before him a complete analysis of the actual expenditures made during an adequate test period. He had ample evidence pro and con as to the necessity and wisdom of these expenditures. It appears that he weighed the proofs, found that in certain respects the expenditures had been extravagant and wasteful, and, in the exercise of judgment, arrived at a cost he considered fair and adequate. The contention is that the amount to be expended for these purposes is purely a question of managerial judgment. But this overlooks the consideration that the charge is for a public \n\n[298 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n service, and regulation cannot be frustrated by a requirement that the rate be made to compensate extravagant or unnecessary costs for these or any purposes. We are not persuaded that the conclusions as to proper allowances on this head were without substantial support in the record.\n\n 4. \nIt is charged that the secretary erred in using a single year, 1932, as a test period. For detailed figures he used only that year, but he had before him a cost analysis for 1931, a survey of the economic history of the Chicago market and the factors which have influenced it since its establishment in 1865, a record of the annual receipts for each year from 1865 to 1932, and a tabulation of the monthly receipts for the years 1923 to 1932, inclusive. In addition he had data as to the relation of the volume of receipts at this market between 1920 and 1932, inclusive, to the total receipts of all the important livestock markets in the country; the ratios of rail and truck receipts for the years 1923 to 1932, inclusive, and a record of seasonal variations in rail and truck receipts for 1932. He had studies showing distribution of receipts amongst the different classes of animals in each year from 1923 to 1932, inclusive. His findings show that he gave consideration to changing economic conditions affecting the Chicago market. They show that he used 1932 as a test period because it was favorable to the appellants, since the receipts at Chicago in that year were hower than those for any of the preceding ten years, and therefore unit costs calculated on the basis of receipts in that year would naturally tend to be higher than those of preceding yea s. In the light of the proofs and the findings, we are unable to find anything arbitrary or unreasonable in the selection of the data on which to base a judgment.\n\n 5. \nThe appellants assert the secretary acted arbitrarily in refusing to rehear the case. Hearings began \n\n[298 U.S. 426, 432]\n\u00a0\n May 15 and ended November 7, 1933. December 13 the matter was argued. January 8, 1934, the original order was entered prescribing maximum rates effective February 7, 1934. On the day last mentioned, the appellants presented a petition for rehearing which is not in the record. From the summary of its contents found in the bill, it appears that petitioners claimed the reduction in revenues consequent upon the new rates made it impossible for them to pay necessary operating expenses which had been increased by the National Recovery Act (48 Stat. 195) and the Agricultural Adjustment Act (48 Stat. 31); that costs should have been calculated by using the draft rather than the consignment as a basis; that the rates were inconsistent with the level of costs and the trend of costs during 1933; and that the petitioners desired to prove the efficiency of their methods of handling animals during 1933. Data in support of the petition was tendered and received. The secretary reconsidered his prior decision, refused a rehearing, and ordered certain increases in the rates. Within a month appellants presented an amended petition for rehearing which is not in the record, but is sketched in the bill of complaint. The reasons advanced in support of the application are alleged to have been: A net reduction of 25 per cent. of gross income as compared with 1933 would result from the new schedule; such a reduction would render petitioners' income insufficient to pay the costs of doing business; the schedules promulgated were based on findings for the years 1931 and 1932 whereas, during 1933 and 1934, profound changes occurred which adversely affected the petitioners' business; the federal legislation of 1933 increased petitioners' expenses. It thus appears that although the appellants had opportunity until one month prior to the making of the order to produce any evidence as to conditions prevailing during 1933, and to call attention to any conclusions to be drawn therefrom, they delayed \n\n[298 U.S. 426, 433]\n\u00a0\n doing so until shortly after the order was issued. The delay in presenting proofs concerning these matters is unexplained. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The amended petition was filed about three months after the original order issued. It is inconceivable that economic conditions had so altered in this brief period as to demonstrate that the new schedule of rates, if just when promulgated, had become unjust and oppressive. The schedule should have been given a trial, and any alteration or modification should have been asked in the light of more extensive experience. We are unable to find anything arbitrary or unreasonable in the denial of the petitions.\n\n 6. \nThe appellants insist that they were entitled to a trial de novo on the issue of confiscation and on the issue of the denial of the petitions for rehearing.\n A majority of the District Court said (12 F.Supp. 776, 781): 'Having considered the new evidence offered for the first time in this court, and all the evidence offered before the Secretary, and having concluded, as we have, that there is no showing of confiscation, we find it unnecessary to determine whether the evidence offered for the first time in this court was admissible. Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420\n, 50 S. Ct. 220.'\n One of the judges, in a separate opinion, stated: 'I do not concur in the findings of this court which adopt in toto the findings of fact made by the Secretary of Agriculture. Some of them, particularly those relating to salesmanship costs and allowances for business getting and maintaining expenses, are, in my opinion, against the weight of evidence. However, I am not prepared to say that the findings were made without any evidence to support them. I join, therefore, in the entry of the decree dismissing the bill.' \n\n[298 U.S. 426, 434]\n\u00a0\n It is to be noted that in spite of the allegations of the bill the case does not involve any question of confiscation. The appellants employ little physical property in their business and no complaint is made as to the allowance of interest on such as they do employ. They render a personal service and the issue before the secretary was whether the uniform schedule of rates for that service was or was not reasonable. On this issue he was bound to afford the appellants due process. In fact he gave them adequate notice and accorded them a full hearing. He carefully weighed the evidence, as demonstrated by voluminous and detailed findings; he exposed with candor the facts and considerations forming the basis of his ultimate conclusions. The appellants had opportunity for a full presentation of their case. Under section 316 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C.A.  217) the District Court sits not to afford a trial de novo, but to review the administrative action. Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra, \n280 U.S. 420\n, at page 443, 50 S.Ct. 220. No reason appears why the appellants could not be afforded due process of law by a review of any questions they deemed material upon the record as made in the administrative proceeding, or why the delay, expense, and burden of a new trial should be imposed simply because they demanded it. The issue before the secretary was not confiscation, but the reasonableness of a charge for personal service. No new or different issue could have been presented upon a trial de novo. We think the court correctly held that its function was the consideration of questions raised upon the record made before the secretary.\n Little need be said concerning the claim that a trial de novo should have been afforded the appellants on the question of their right to a rehearing. As has been said, the bill of complaint summarizes the petition and amended petition for rehearing and asserts that the secretary arbitrarily refused to grant them. No evidence in \n\n[298 U.S. 426, 435]\n\u00a0\n support of this allegation was tendered in the District Court. It is idle to discuss the right of the appellants to make a showing in this behalf in the District Court when in fact none was made or attempted and the court was left, as we are, with no light on the subject save what is afforded by the record before the secretary and the averments of the complaint.\n The decree is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 42 Stat. 159, U.S.C. tit. 7, c. 9 (7 U.S.C.A.  181-229). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare United States v.

Benton and Hampson Gary, both of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to set aside an order of the Federal Communications Commission prescribing a uniform system of accounts for telephone companies subject to the Communications Act of 1934. Act of June 19, 1934, c. 652, 48 Stat. 1064, 47 U.S.C.  151 et seq. (47 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.). The plaintiffs are forty-four telephone companies, thirty- seven of them members of the Bell system, and seven of them members of another group. The defendants are the United States and the Federal Communications Commission, with whom the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners was afterwards joined, intervening as the representative of the regulatory commissions of forty-six states in support of the contested order.\n The Communications Act of 1934 provides (section 220 (47 U.S.C.A.  220)) that 'the Commission may, in its discretion, prescribe the forms of any and all accounts, records, and memoranda' to be kept by carriers subject to the act, 'including the accounts, records, and memoranda of the movement of traffic, as well as of the receipts and expenditures of moneys.' This is a power that had previously been lodged with the Interstate Commerce Commission (Interstate Commerce Act,  20(5), 49 U.S.C.A.  20(5), which framed a set of rules for telephone companies to take effect January 1, 1913, and a revised set of rules effective January 1, 1933. \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 236]\n\u00a0\n After the transfer of jurisdiction over telephone companies from the Interstate Commerce Commission to the Federal Communications Commission in 1934, the new Commission prepared a 'draft of a Uniform System of Accounts,' which was considered at a conference with representatives of the companies and of the state commissions. The outcome of the conference was the order of June 19, 1935, to take effect January 1, 1936, which is the subject of this suit.\n The plaintiffs having moved for an interlocutory injunction, the cause was heard, in accordance with the requirement of the statute (47 U.S. C.  402(a) (47 U.S.C.A.  402(a)); 28 U.S.C.  47 (28 U.S.C.A.  47)), by a District Court of three judges, the affidavits in support of the motion and against it being also submitted for and against the final decree. Five provisions of the order were attacked as arbitrary. The District Court sustained two objections of minor importance, which are not in controversy now, and overruled the others. One of these was directed to the 'original cost' rule; the second to a provision as to 'just and reasonable' charges; the third to a classification dividing plants in present use from those held for use thereafter. The court dismissed the bill as to the objections overruled, stating in an opinion the reasons for its action. 14 F.Supp. 121. The case is here upon appeal. 48 Stat. 1064, 1093,  402(a), 47 U.S.C .  402(a), 47 U.S.C.A.  402(a); 38 Stat. 219, 220, 28 U.S.C.  47, 47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, 47a.\n This court is not at liberty to substitute its own discretion for that of administrative officers who have kept within the bounds of their administrative powers. To show that these have been exceeded in the field of action here involved, it is not enough that the prescribed system of accounts shall appear to be unwise or burdensome or inferior to another. Error or unwisdom is not equivalent to abuse. What has been ordered must appear to be 'so entirely at odds with fundamental principles of cor- \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 237]\n\u00a0\n rect accounting' (Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 423, 444\n, 34 S.Ct. 125, 131, 52 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1) as to be the expression of a whim rather than an exercise of judgment. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 134, 141\n, 53 S.Ct. 52, 54; Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, supra, \n231 U.S. 423\n, at page 456, 34 S.Ct. 125, 52 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1. Then, too, in gauging rationality, regard must steadily be had to the ends that a uniform system of accounts is intended to promote. 'The object of requiring such accounts to be kept in a uniform way, and to be open to the inspection of the Commission, is not to enable it to regulate the affairs of the corporations not within its jurisdiction, but to be informed concerning the business methods of the corporations subject to the act, that it may properly regulate such matters as are really within its jurisdiction.' Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194, 211\n, 32 S.Ct. 436, 439; cf. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, supra, \n231 U.S. 423\n, at page 445, 34 S.Ct. 125, 52 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1. With these principles in mind, we proceed to consider separately the regulations and instructions now challenged as unlawful.\nFirst: The Original Cost Provisions.\n Four new balance sheet accounts, each of them a sub-title of the general title of 'Investments,' must be kept under the new system. The first (100.1) is described as Telephone Plant in Service; the second (100. 2), Telephone Plant under Construction; the third (100.3), Property held for Future Telephone Use; and the fourth (100.4), Telephone Plant Acquisition Adjustment. Account 100.1 'shall include the original cost ( defined by Instruction 3 (S. 1)) of the company's property used in telephone service at the date of the balance sheet.' Account 100.2 'shall include the original cost (as so defined) of construction of telephone plant not completed ready for service' at such date. Account 100.3 'shall include the original cost (so defined) of property owned and held for imminent use in telephone service under a definite plan for such use.' The term 'original cost' as \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 238]\n\u00a0\n appearing in these rules receives (under Instruction 3 (S. 1)) a special definition. \"Original cost' or 'cost,' as applied to telephone plant, franchises, patent rights, and right-of-way, means the actual money cost of (or the current money value of any consideration other than money exchanged for) property at the time when it was first dedicated to the public use, whether by the accounting company or by a predecessor public utility.' If actual costs are unknown, estimates are to take their place. Instruction 21(B). From all this it follows that the sum of the three accounts which represent the original cost of property acquired by the accounting company from other telephone utilities, may be less or greater than the investment in such property by the accounting company itself. The difference is taken care of by account 100.4, Telephone Plant Acquisition Adjustment.* The same rule provides in a subdivision designated (C) that 'the amounts recorded in this account (i.e. 100.4) with respect to each property acquisition shall be disposed of, written off, or provision shall be made for the amortization thereof in such manner as this Commission may direct.'\n Before explaining the appellants' objections to these provisions as to cost, we may pause to indicate the reasons that led to their adoption. To a great extent, the telephone business as conducted in the United States is\n * 'This account shall include the difference between (a) the amount of money actually paid (or the current money value of any consideration other than money exchanged) for telephone plant acquired, plus preliminary expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition; and (b) the original cost (note instruction 3 (S. 1)) of such plant, governmental franchises and similar rights acquired, less the amounts of reserve requirements for depreciation and amortization of the property acquired, and amounts of contributions to the predecessor company or companies for construction and acquisition of such property. If the actual original cost is not known, the entries in this account shall be based upon an estimate of such cost.' \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 239]\n\u00a0\n that of a far flung system of parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies. The Bell system is represented in this case by thirty-seven companies, the American Telephone & Telegraph Company at their head. Seven other companies, intervening as a group, represent a second and smaller system. Purchases are frequently made by a member or members of a system from affiliates or subsidiaries, and with comparative infrequency from strangers. At times obscurity or confusion has been born of such relations. There is widespread belief that transfers between affiliates or subsidiaries complicate the task of rate-making for regulatory commissions and impede the search for truth. Buyer and seller in such circumstances may not be dealing at arm's length, and the price agreed upon between them may be a poor criterion of value. Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm. of Ohio, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 295\n, 54 S.Ct. 647, 650; Western Distributing Co. v. Public Service Comm. of Kansas, \n285 \nU.S. 119\n, 52 S.Ct. 283; Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133\n, 51 S.Ct. 65. Even if the property has been acquired by treaty with an independent utility or a member of a rival system, there is always a possibility that it is nuisance value only-and not market or intrinsic value for the uses of the business-that has dictated the price paid. Accordingly, the work of the Commission may be facilitated by spreading on the face of the accounts a statement of the cost as of the time when the property to be valued was first acquired by a utility or dedicated to the public use. The same considerations show why the regulations do not direct that the inquiry as to original cost shall be carried even farther back, so as to cover, for illustration, the cost to manufacturers who may have sold to the first utility. In the process of analysis, inquiry is halted at the point where it ceases to be fruitful.\n With this explanatory background we can now go forward with understanding to a statement of the objections to the order and a determination of their weight. \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 240]\n\u00a0\n (a) The companies object that by the 'original cost' provisions of the order they are prevented 'from recording their actual investment in their accounts' with the result that the accounts do not fairly exhibit their financial situation to shareholders, investors, tax collectors and others.\n The argument is that account 100.4, representing the difference between original and present cost, is not to be reckoned, either wholly or in part, as a statement of existing assets, but must be written off completely. The Commission is charged, we are told, with a mandatory duty to extinguish the entire balance recorded in that account, its presence under the title of 'investments' having the effect of a misleading label. To give support to that conception of official duty, they rely on subdivision (C), which provides, as we have seen, that 'the amounts recorded in this account with respect to each property acquisition shall be disposed of, written off, or provision shall be made for the amortization thereof in such manner as this Commission may direct.'\n If subdivision (C) had the meaning thus imputed to it, there would be force in the contention that the effect of the order is to distort in an arbitrary fashion the value of the assets. But the imputed meaning is not the true one. The Commission is not under a duty to write off the whole or any part of the balance in 100.4, if the difference between original and present cost is a true increment of value. On the contrary, only such amount will be written off as appears, upon an application for appropriate directions, to be a fictitious or paper increment. This is made clear, if it might otherwise be doubtful, by administrative construction. Thus, the Commission's chief accountant testified that by the proper interpretation of account 100.4, amounts therein 'would be disposed of, after the character of the item had been determined, in a manner consistent with the general rules underlying the uniform \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 241]\n\u00a0\n system of accounts for the distribution of expenditures, according to their character, to operating expenses, income, surplus, or remain an investment.' Other witnesses gave testimony in substance to the same effect. But even more decisive are statements made by counsel, appearing for the Government and arguing the case before us. To avoid the chance of misunderstanding and to give adequate assurance to the companies as to the practice to to followed, we requested the Assistant Attorney General to reduce his statements in that regard to writing in behalf of the Commission. He did this and informs us that 'the Federal Communications Commission construes the provisions of Telephone Division Order No. 7-C, issued June 19, 1935, pertaining to account 100.4' as meaning 'that amounts included in account 100.4 that are deemed, after a fair consideration of all the circumstances, to represent an investment which the accounting company has made in assets of continuing value will be retained in that account until such assets cease to exist or are retired; and, in accordance with paragraph (C) of account 100.4, provision will be made for their amortization.'\n We accept this declaration as an administrative construction binding upon the Commission in its future dealings with the companies. Hicklin v. Coney, \n290 \nU.S. 169, 175\n, 54 S.Ct. 142, 145; Addy Co. v. United States, \n264 \nU.S. 239, 245\n, 44 S.Ct. 300, 302. The case in that respect is sharply distinguished from New York Edison Co. v. Maltbie, 244 App.Div. 685, 281 N.Y.S. 223; Id., 271 N.Y. 103, 2 N.E.(2d) 277, where under rules prescribed by the Public Service Commission of New York, there was an inflexible requirement that an account similar in some aspects to 100.4 be written off in its entirety out of surplus, whether the value there recorded was genuine or false. The administrative construction now affixed to the contested order devitalizes the objection that the difference between \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 242]\n\u00a0\n present value and original cost is withdrawn from recognition as a legitimate investment.\n We are not impressed by the argument that the classification is to be viewed as arbitrary because the fate of any item, its ultimate disposition, remains in some degree uncertain until the Commission has given particular directions with reference thereto. By being included in the adjustment account, it is classified as provisionally a true investment, subject to be taken out of that account and given a different character if investigation by the Commission shows it to be deserving of that treatment. Such a reservation does not amount to a departure from the statutory power to fix the forms of accounts for 'classes' of carriers rather than for individuals. The forms of the accounts are fixed, and fixed by regulations of adequate generality. What disposition of their content may afterwards be suitable upon discovery that particular items have been carried at an excessive figure must depend upon evidentiary circumstances, difficult to define or catalogue in advance of the event. If once there was any need for explanation more precise than that afforded by the order, it is now supplied, we think, by an administrative construction, which must be read into the order as supplementary thereto.\n\n\n (b)\n The companies object that by the provisions as to 'original cost' they are prevented 'from recovering depreciation expense, which they actually incur, on their actual investment,' and are required 'to base depreciation charges on the cost to a prior owner.'\n This objection, like the one last considered, has its origin in the belief that what is recorded in 'telephone plant acquisition adjustment' must inevitably be written off, and is not subject to the treatment appropriate to genuine assets.\n Here again the construction of the regulations by the Commission itself is enough to dispel the fear that in their practical operation they will become instruments \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 243]\n\u00a0\n of hardship. Without dwelling on the testimony, we content ourselves with a quotation from the statement filed by counsel at the conclusion of the argument. The Commission there informs us that 'when amounts included in account 100.4 are deemed, after a fair consideration of all the circumstances, to be definitely attributable to depreciable telephone plant, provision will be made for amortization of such amounts through operating expenses, through the medium of either account 613 (which covers the amortization of intangible property) or account 675 (which includes all operating expenses not properly chargeable to other accounts).'\n Obviously account 675 was inserted as a catch-all to cover previous omissions. We do not need to inquire whether under an ideal system of accounting the amounts to be amortized would be chargeable to an account entitled in some other way. It is enough that by the ruling of the Commission they will find a lodgement here, with an appropriate entry betokening their meaning. A system of accounts may be awkward or imperfect, and yet not so 'arbitrary and outrageous' (Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. United States, supra, \n287 U.S. 134\n, at page 143, 53 S.Ct. 52, 55) as to justify a court in restraining its enforcement.\n Appellants insist that amortization is an afterthought as applied to the account in controversy, and that there must be an amendment of the rules, if the Commission is to resort to such a process. We read the record otherwise. In setting up the amortization reserve account (172), the rules expressly provide that 'it shall also be credited with any amounts which the Commission may authorize under a plan to amortize the balance in account 100.4, Telephone Plant Acquisition Adjustment.'\n In the same connection, the point is made that section 220(b) of the Act requires more specific directions as to depreciation or amortization than the Commission has supplied. By that section, 'the Commission shall, as soon as practicable, prescribe ... the classes of property for \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 244]\n\u00a0\n which depreciation charges may be properly included under operating expenses.' No objection is made that the directions are not sufficiently specific as to account 100.1, Telephone Plant in Service. The objection is confined to account 100.4. But one of the very reasons for establishing that account is that in advance of inquiry by the Commission as to the property there included it is impracticable to determine what portion of it may properly be subjected to charges of this nature. When that inquiry has been completed, the Commission will be in possession of the necessary data. Provision will then be made for amortization of any amounts in the account that may properly be classified as investment in depreciable property. The label is unimportant, whether depreciation or amortization, if the substance of allowance is adequately preserved.\n\n\n (c)\n The companies object that by the 'original cost' provisions of the order they are required, where the actual cost is unknown, to record an estimate of cost, and that this requirement is an arbitrary one, mutilating their accounts and exposing them to the hazard of criminal prosecution.\n What was ordered by the Commission in that behalf is expressly authorized by the statute with the result that to invalidate the order will be to invalidate the statute also. By section 213(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.A.  213(c) it is provided that 'if any part of such cost cannot be determined from accounting or other records, the portion of the property for which such cost cannot be determined shall be reported to the Commission; and, if the Commission shall so direct, the original cost thereof shall be estimated in such manner as the Commission may prescribe.'\n In the vast majority of cases, original cost will be ascertainable from the records of the previous owners. If these have been lost or are not available or trustworthy, the order makes provision for the substitution of an estimate. Difficulties in the making of such an estimate are \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 245]\n\u00a0\n indicated by the companies. We doubt whether in any instance they will be found to be insuperable, but if they shall ever prove to be so, means will be at hand whereby an avenue of escape from injustice will be opened without resort to the drastic remedy of declaring the order void. Estimates are at times inevitable in any system of accounts. Even under the system previously in vogue, the total purchase price, which was entered in an account known as 'telephone plant,' was subdivided into a series of accounts covering respectively pole lines, cable, aerial wire, and other classes, and distributed among them. If the price was a lump sum, there was need to resort to estimates in the process of subdivision. So, also, estimates were always necessary upon the retirement of plant or equipment acquired at varying dates, unless the articles retired were so clearly identified that the dates of acquisition and the prices then paid for each of them were susceptible of ascertainment upon the face of the accounts themselves. All that can be said of the present regulations is that they make the occasion for estimates more frequent than in former years and the process more involved. The difference in degree is not proved to be so great as to drag nullity in its train. If instances shall occur in which a company is unable to make an intelligent estimate with even approximate correctness, that exceptional event will justify resort to the Commission for particular instructions. In no event is there a substantial hazard of criminal prosecution. To subject the company or its officers to prosecution for a crime the violation of the Act must have been knowing and wilful. Communications Act of 1934,  501, 502, 47 U.S.C. A.  501, 502; Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497, 502\n, 503 S., 45 S.Ct. 141, 142, 143; United States v. Murdock, \n290 \nU.S. 389\n, 54 S.Ct. 223. Penalties do not follow upon innocent mistakes.\n\n\n (d)\n The companies object also that even when property recorded in the adjustment account (100.4) is recognized by the Commission as a continuing investment, \n\n[299 U.S. 232, 246]\n\u00a0\n there will be difficulty in determining the amount to be written out of that account when the property is withdrawn. No reason is apparent why this difficulty should be any greater than it would be if the same property had been recorded in a single plant account without separation of the original cost from the cost at later dates. However that may be, there is ample provision in the rules for clarifying instructions whenever duty is uncertain.\nSecond: The Provisions for Just and Reasonable Charges.\n The companies object to the following instructions (described as 2(B. 1)): 'All charges to the accounts prescribed in this classification for telephone plant, income, operating revenues, and operating expenses shall be just and reasonable and any payments by the company in excess of such just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 323, 'Miscellaneous income charges.\"\n The purpose of this requirement is to prevent the padding of the accounts by charges knowingly and willfully entered in excess of what is just and reasonable. Only if knowingly and willfully so entered is any penalty prescribed therefor. United States v. Murdock, supra. There is surely nothing arbitrary in establishing a standard of behavior so consistent with good morals. On the contrary, the need for such a standard has been made manifest for years as the result of intercorporate relations that are matters of common knowledge. Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm. of Ohio, supra; Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n292 \nU.S. 151\n, 54 S.Ct. 658. 'The Commission must have power to prevent evasion of its orders and detect in any formal compliance or in the assignment of expenses a 'possible concealment of forbidden practices.\" Smith v.

We do not look at it that way. Property held for imminent use in telephone service and under a definite plan will include spare plants kept in reserve as a measure of prudent administration. Such uses had consideration by this court in a recent opinion. Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Utilities Comm. of Ohio, \n292 \nU.S. 398\n, 52 S.Ct. 763, 91 A.L.R. 1403.

Harrison, both of San Francisco, Cal., amici curiae, for petitioners.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, a water improvement district embracing 43,000 acres in Cameron county, Tex., was organized in 1914 under the laws of that state. Claiming to be insolvent and unable to meet its debts as they matured, it presented to the United States District Court, December 5, 1934, an amended petition with plan for adjusting its obligations-$800,000 6 per cent. bonds. This proposed final settlement of these obligations through payment of 49.8 cents on the dollar out of funds to be borrowed from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation at 4 per cent.\n The petition follows and seeks relief under the act of Congress approved May 24, 1934, c. 345,  78, 79 and 80, 48 Stat. 798, title 11 U. S.C.A.  301, 302 and 303.* It alleges that more than 30 per cent. of the bondholders had accepted the plan and ultimately more than two-thirds would do so. The prayer asks confirmation of the proposal and that nonassenting bondholders be required to accept it.\n Owners of more than 5 per cent. of outstanding bonds appeared, said there was no jurisdiction, denied the ex- \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 524]\n\u00a0\n istence of insolvency, and asked that the petition be held insufficient.\n The trial court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. It held:\n The petitioner is a mere agency or instrumentality of the state, created for local exercise of her sovereign power-reclamation of arid land through irrigation. It owns no private property and carries on public business only. The bonds are contracts of the state, executed through this agency, and secured by taxes levied upon local property. Congress lacks power to authorize a federal court to readjust obligations, as provided by the act. Also the allegations of fact are insufficient.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals took the cause, considered the points presented, and held that the allegations were adequate to show jurisdiction and to warrant introduction of evidence. Also that Congress had exercised the power 'to establish ... uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies,' granted by section 8, cl. 4, art. 1 of the Constitution. Accordingly it reversed the trial court and remanded the cause.\n The Act of May 24, 1934 (48 Stat. 798), amended the Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, by adding chapter 9 (three sections 78, 79, 80, 11 U.S.C.A.  301-303), captioned 'Provisions for the Emergency Temporary Aid of Insolvent Public Debtors and to Preserve the Assets Thereof and for other Related Purposes.'\n Section 78 asserts an emergency rendering imperative further exercise of the bankruptcy powers. Section 79 directs that, 'in addition to the jurisdiction exercised in voluntary and involuntary proceedings to adjudge persons bankrupt, courts of bankruptcy shall exercise original jurisdiction in proceedings for the relief of debtors, as provided in this chapter.'\n Section 80-long and not free from ambiguities-in twelve paragraphs (a to l) prescribes the mode and con- \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 525]\n\u00a0\n ditions unde which, when unable to pay its debts as they mature, 'any municipality or other political subdivision of any State, including ... any county, city, borough, village, parish, town, or township, unincorporated tax or special assessment district, and any school, drainage, irrigation, reclamation, levee, sewer, or paving, sanitary, port, improvement or other districts' may effect a readjustment. A brief outline of the salient provisions, with some quotations, will suffice for present purposes.\n The petition for relief must be filed in the District Court and submit plan for readjustment approved by creditors holding 30 per cent. of the obligations to be affected; also complete list of creditors. If satisfied that the petition is in good faith and follows the statute, the judge shall enter an approving order; otherwise it must be dismissed. Creditors holding 5 per cent. of the indebtedness may appear in opposition.\n'A plan of readjustment within the meaning of this chapter shall include provisions modifying or altering the rights of creditors generally, or any class of them, secured or unsecured, either through the issuance of new securities of any character or otherwise; and may contain such other provisions and agreements, not inconsistent with this chapter, as the parties may desire.'\n\n Upon approval of the petition, creditors must be notified; if the plan is not seasonably accepted, extension may be granted, etc.\n Hearings must be accorded. The judge, with its approval, 'may direct the rejection of contracts of the taxing district executory in whole or in part.' He may require the district to open its books; allow reasonable compensation; stay suits; enter an interlocutory decree declaring the plan temporarily operative, etc. 'But (he) shall not, by any order or decree, in the proceeding or otherwise, interfere with any of the political or govern- \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 526]\n\u00a0\n mental powers of the taxing district, or any of the property or revenues of the taxing district necessary in the opinion of the judge for essential governmental purposes, or any income-producing property, unless the plan of readjustment so provides.'\n After hearing, the judge shall confirm the plan, if satisfied that it is fair, equitable, for the best interests of the creditors, does not unduly discriminate, complies with the statute, and has been accepted by those holding two-thirds of the indebtedness. Also that expenses incident to the readjustment have been provided for, that both plan and acceptance are in good faith, and the district is authorized by law to take all necessary action.\n The provisions of the plan, after order of confirmation, shall be binding upon the district and all creditors, secured or unsecured. Final decree shall discharge the district from all debts and liabilities dealt with by the plan, except as otherwise provided.\n Section 80(k), 11 U.S.C.A.  303(k): 'Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the power of any State to control, by legislation or otherwise, any political subdivision thereof in the exercise of its political or governmental powers, including expenditures therefor, and including the power to require the approval by any governmental agency of the State of the filing of any petition hereunder and of any plan of readjustment, and whenever there shall exist or shall hereafter be created under the law of any State any agency of such State authorized to exercise supervision or control over the fiscal affairs of all or any political subdivisions thereof, and whenever such agency has assumed such supervision or control over any political subdivision, then no petition of such political subdivision may be received hereunder unless accompanied by the written approval of such agency, and no plan of readjustment shall be put into temporary effect or finally confirmed without the written approval of such agency of such plans.' \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 527]\n\u00a0\n We need not consider this act in detail or undertake definitely to classify it. The evident intent was to a thorize a federal court to require objecting creditors to accept an offer by a public corporation to compromise, scale down, or repudiate its indebtedness without the surrender of any property whatsoever. The act has been assailed upon the ground that it is not in any proper sense a law on the subject of bankruptcies, and therefore is beyond the power of Congress; also because it conflicts with the Fifth Amendment. Passing these and other objections, we assume for this discussion that the enactment is adequately related to the general 'subject of bankruptcies.' See Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, \n186 \nU.S. 181\n, 22 S.Ct. 857; Continental Illinois N.B. & T. Co. v. Chicago, R.I. & P.R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 948\n, 55 S.Ct. 595; Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 97 A.L.R. 1106\n\n\n The respondent was organized in 1914 as Cameron county irrigation district No. 1, to furnish water for irrigation and domestic uses; in 1919 it became the Cameron county water improvement district No. 1, all as authorized by statutes passed under section 52, art. 3, Constitution of Texas, which permits creation of political divisions of the state, with power to sue and be sued, issue bonds, levy and collect taxes. An amendment to the Constitution-section 59a, art. 16-(October 2, 1917) declares the conservation and development of all the natural resources of the state, including reclamation of lands and their preservation, are 'public rights and duties.' Most of the bonds now in question were issued during 1914; the remainder in 1919.\n By act approved April 27, 1935, Laws Tex.1935, c. 107 (Vernon's Ann. Civ.St.Tex. art. 1024a), the Texas Legislature declared that municipalities, political subdivisions, taxing districts, etc., might proceed under the act of Congress approved May 24, 1934.\n It is plain enough that respondent is a political subdivision of the state, created for the local exercise of \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 528]\n\u00a0\n her sovereign powers, and that the right to borrow money is essential to its operations. Houck v. Little River Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 261\n, 262 S., 36 S.Ct. 58; Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330\n, 55 S. Ct. 432, 95 A.L.R. 1335. Its fiscal affairs are those of the state, not subject to control or interference by the national government, unless the right so to do is definitely accorded by the Federal Constitution.\n The pertinent doctrine, now firmly established, was stated through Mr. Chief Justice Chase in Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725:\n'We have already had occasion to remark at this term, that 'the people of each State compose a State, having its own government, and endowed with all the functions essential to separate and independent existence,' and that 'without the States in union, there could be no such political body as the United States.' Not only, therefore, can there be no loss of separate and independent autonomy to the States, through their union under the Constitution, but it may be not unreasonably said that the preservation of the States, and the maintenance of their governments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National government. The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.'\n\n Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 125, 126:\n'Such being the separate and independent condition of the States in our complex system, as recognized by the Constitution, and the existence of which is so indispensable, that, without them, the general government itself would disappear from the family of nations, it would seem to follow, as a reasonable, if not a necessary consequence, that the means and instrumentalities employed for carrying on the operations of their governments, for preserving their existence, and fulfilling the high and responsible duties assigned to them in the Con- \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 529]\n\u00a0\n stitution, should be left free and unimpaired, should not be liable to be crippled, much less defeated by the taxing power of another government, which power acknowledges no limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the tax. And, more especially, those means and instrumentalities which are the creation of their sovereign and reserved rights, one of which is the establishment of the judicial department, and the appointment of officers to administer their laws. Without this power, and the exercise of it, we risk nothing in saying that no one of the States under the form of government guaranteed by the Constitution could long preserve its existence.'\n\n In Indian Motocycle Company v. United States, \n283 U.S. 570\n, 575, et seq., 51 S.Ct. 601, 603, relevant cases are collected and the following conclusion announced:\n'This principle is implied from the independence of the national and state governments within their respective spheres and from the provisions of the Constitution which look to the maintenance of the dual system.'\n\n Notwithstanding the broad grant of power 'to lay and collect taxes,' opinions here plainly show that Congress could not levy any tax on the bonds issued by the respondent or upon income derived therefrom. So to do would be an unwarranted interference with fiscal matters of the state- essentials to her existence. Many opinions explain and support this view. In United States v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, 17 Wall. 322, 329, this court said:\n'A municipal corporation like the city of Baltimore, is a representative not only of the State, but is a portion of its governmental power. It is one of its creatures, made for a specific purpose, to exercise within a limited sphere the powers of the State. The State may withdraw these local powers of government at pleasure, and may, through its legislature or other appointed channels, govern the local territory as it governs the State at large. It may enlarge or contract its powers or destroy its existence. As \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 530]\n\u00a0\n a portion of the State in the exercise of a limited portion of the powers of the State, its revenues, like those of the State, are not subject to taxation.'\n\n See, also, Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 586\n, 15 S.Ct. 673; Id., \n158 \nU.S. 601, 630\n, 15 S.Ct. 912.\n The power 'to establish ... uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies' can have no higher rank or importance in our scheme of government than the power 'to lay and collect taxes.' Both are granted by the same section of the Constitution, and we find no reason for saying that one is impliedly limited by the necessity of preserving independence of the states while the other is not. Accordingly, as application of the statutory provisions now before us might materially restrict respondent's control over its fiscal affairs, the trial court rightly declared them invalid.\n If federal bankruptcy laws can be extended to respondent, why not to the state? If voluntary proceedings may be permitted, so may involuntary ones, subject, of course, to any inhibition of the Eleventh Amendment. Matter of Quarles and Butler, \n158 \nU.S. 532, 535\n, 15 S.Ct. 959. If the state were proceeding under a statute like the present one, with terms broad enough to include her, apparently the problem would not be materially different. Our special concern is with the existence of the power claimed-not merely the immediate outcome of what has already been attempted. And it is of the first importance that due attention be given to the results which might be brought about by the exercise of such a power in the future.\n The especial purpose of all bankruptcy legislation is to interfere with the relations between the parties concerned-to change, modify, or impair the obligation of their contracts. The statute before us expresses this design in plain terms. It undertakes to extend the supposed power of the federal government incident to bankruptcy over any embarrassed district which may ap- \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 531]\n\u00a0\n ply to the court. See Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330, 353\n, 55 S.Ct. 432, 95 A.L.R. 1335.\n If obligations of states or their political subdivisions may be subjected to the interference here attempted, they are no longer free to manage their own affairs; the will of Congress prevails over them; although inhibited, the right to tax might be less sinister. And really the sovereignty of the state, so often declared necessary to the federal system, does not exist. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 430; Farmers' & Mechanics' Sav. Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 \nU.S. 516, 526\n, 34 S. Ct. 354.\n The Constitution was careful to provide that 'no State shall ... pass any ... Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.' (Const. art. 1 ,  10.) This she may not do under the form of a bankruptcy act or otherwise. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 191. Nor do we think she can accomplish the same end by granting any permission necessary to enable Congress so to do.\n Neither consent nor submission by the states can enlarge the powers of Congress; none can exist except those which are granted. United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914, decided January 6, 1936. The sovereignty of the state essential to its proper functioning under the Federal Constitution cannot be surrendered; it cannot be taken away by any form of legislation. See United States v. Constantine, \n296 \nU.S. 287\n, 56 S.Ct. 223.\n Like any sovereignty, a state may voluntarily consent to be sued; may permit actions against her political subdivisions to enforce their obligations. Such proceedings against these subdivisions have often been entertained in federal courts. But nothing in this tends to support the view that the federal government, acting under the bankruptcy clause, may impose its will and impair state powers-pass laws inconsistent with the idea of sovereignty.\n The power to regulate commerce is necessarily exclusive in certain fields and, to be successful, must prevail \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 532]\n\u00a0\n over obstructive regulations by the state. But, as pointed out in Houston, etc., Ry. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 353\n, 34 S.Ct. 833, 837, 'this is not to say that Congress possesses the authority to regulate the internal commerce of a state, as such, but that it does possess the power to foster and protect interstate commerce.' No similar situation is before us.\n The difficulties arising out of our dual form of government and the opportunities for differing opinions concerning the relative rights of state and national governments are many; but for a very long time this court has steadfastly adhered to the doctrine that the taxing power of Congress does not extend to the states or their political subdivisions. The same basic reasoning which leads to that conclusion, we think, requires like limitation upon the power which springs from the bankruptcy clause. United States v. Butler, supra.\n The challenge to the validity of the statute must be sustained. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed. The cause will be returned to the District Court for further action consistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting.\n The question is a narrow one: Is there power in the Congress under the Constitution of the United States to permit local governmental units generally, and irrigation or water improvement districts in particular, to become voluntary bankrupts with the consent of their respective states?\n Cameron county water improvement district No. 1 is a public corporation created by the laws of Texas. It has issued bonds for the construction of a canal system, which bonds are outstanding in the amount of $802,000. Default has been suffered to the extent of $147,000, either \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 533]\n\u00a0\n for principal or for interest, upon its obligations now matured. But its own indebtedness is only a part of the financial burden that oppresses it. The bonded debt of other municipalities is a superior lien upon the property in the district for $10,386,000, and accumulated interest. The population is mainly agricultural. The farmers have been unable by reason of the great depression to make a living from their farms, and unable to pay their taxes in appreciable amounts. The district has made diligent effort to enforce collections, but without success. When it has attempted to foreclose its liens, it has been compelled for lack of bidders to buy the lands in and pay the court costs. After buying the lands in, it has been unable to get rid of them, for they have been subject to other tax liens prior to its own. The defaults are steadily mounting. For the year 1932, they were 63 per cent.; for the year 1933, 88.9 per cent. The average market value of lands in the district does not exceed $75 per acre; and the total bonded debt per acre, principal and interest, is approximately $100. In these circumstances little good can come of levying more taxes to pyramid the existing structure. The remedies of bondholders are nominal, not real.\n What is true of Cameron county water improvement district No. 1 is true in essentials of thousands of other public corporations in widely scattered areas. The hearings by committees of the Congress before the passage of the statute exhibit in vivid fashion the breadth and depth of the mischief which the statute was designed to remedy. \n1\n In January, 1934, 2,019 municipalities, counties, and other governmental units were known to be in default. \n2\n On the list, which was incomplete, were large \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 534]\n\u00a0\n cities as well as tiny districts. Many regions were included: 41 out of 48 states. Students of government have estimated that on January 1, 1933, out of securities to the extent of $14,000,000,000 issued by units smaller than the states, a billion were in default. \n3\n The plight of the debtors was bad enough; that of the creditors was even worse. It is possible that in some instances the bonds did not charge the municipalities or other units with personal liability. Even when they did, however, execution could not issue against the property of the debtor held for public uses,4 and few of the debtors were the owners of anything else. In such circumstances the only remedy was a mandamus whereby the debtor was commanded to tax and tax again. Rees v. City of Watertown, 19 Wall. 107; Meriwether v. Garrett, \n102 U.S. 472\n, 501. 5 The command was mere futility when tax values were exhausted. Often the holders of the bonds, to the extent of 90 per cent. or more were ready to scale down the obligations and put the debtor on its feet. A recalcitrant minority had capacity to block the plan. Nor was there hope for relief from statutes to be enacted by the states. The Constitution prohibits the states from passing any law that will impair the obligation of existing contracts, and a state insolvency act is of no avail as to obligations of the debtor incurred before its passage. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122. Relief must come from Congress if it is to come from any one.\n The next step in the inquiry has to do with the power of the Congress to eradicate the mischief. Is the act in question, adopted May 24, 1934, to continue for two years (sections 78, 79 and 80 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, as amended by 48 Stat. 798, 11 U.S.C.  301, 302, 303 (11 U.S.C.A .  301-303)), \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 535]\n\u00a0\n and now extended to January 1, 1940 (P.L. 507, approved April 10, 1936 (11 U.S.C.A.  302 ), a law 'on the subject of Bankruptcies' within article 1, section 8, cl. 4, of the Constitution of the United States? Recent opinions of this court have traced the origin and growth of the bankruptcy power. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 668\n, 55 S.Ct. 595; Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555, 588\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 97 A.L.R. 1106. The history is one of an expanding concept. It is, however, an expanding concept that has had to fight its way. Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, \n186 \nU.S. 181, 184\n, 22 S.Ct. 857; Charles Warren, Bankruptcy in United States History (1935) p. 9. Almost every change has been hotly denounced in its beginnings as a usurpation of power. Only time or judicial decision has had capacity to silence opposition. At the adoption of the Constitution, the English and Colonial bankruptcy laws were limited to traders and to involuntary proceedings. An act of Congress passed in 1800 (2 Stat. 19) added bankers, brokers, factors, and underwriters. Doubt was expressed as to the validity of the extension (Adams v. Storey, Fed.Cas.No. 66, 1 Paine, 79, 82), which established itself, however, with the passing of the years. Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, supra. Other classes were brought in later, through the Bankruptcy Act of 1841 (5 Stat. 440) and its successors, 'until now practically all classes of persons and corporations are included.' Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., supra, \n294 U.S. 648\n, at page 670, 55 S.Ct. 595, 604. For nearly a century voluntary proceedings have been permitted at the instance of the debtor as well as involuntary proceedings on the petition of creditors. The amendment, however, was resisted. The debates in Congress bear witness to the intensity of the feeling aroused by its proposal. Warren, op. cit. supra, at page 72 et seq. For more than sixty years the debtor has been able to compel a minority of his creditors to accept a composition if the terms have been approved by a designated majority as well as by the judge. \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 536]\n\u00a0\n This change, like the others, had to meet a storm of criticism in Congress and the courts. Warren, op. cit. supra, at pages 44, 45, 118-120; In re Klein, reported in a note to Nelson v. Carland, 1 How. 265, 277, 130; Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, supra. Since the enactment of section 77 in March, 1933 (47 Stat. 1474, 11 U.S.C.  205 (11 U.S.C.A.  205)), a court of bankruptcy has been empowered to reorganize railroad corporations unable to pay their debts as they mature ( Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., supra), and, since the enactment of section 77 B in June, 1934 (48 Stat. 912, 11 U.S.C.  207 (11 U.S.C.A.  207)), a like jurisdiction has existed in respect of business corporations generally. The act for the relief of local governmental units is a stage in an evolutionary process which is likely to be misconceived unless regarded as a whole. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Throughout that evolutionary process, the court has hewn a straight path. \n7\n Disclaiming a willingness to bind \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 537]\n\u00a0\n itself by a cramping definition, it has been able none the less to indicate with clearness the main lines of its approach. In substance, it agrees with Cowen, J., who wrote: 'I read the constitution thus: 'Congress shall have power to establish uniform laws on the subject of any person's general inability to pay his debts throughout the United States\" (Kunzler v. Kohaus, 5 Hill (N.Y.) 317, 321), and with Blatchford, J., writing in the Matter of Reiman, 20 Fed.Cas. 490, at page 496, No. 11,673, that the subject of bankruptcy cannot properly be defined as 'anything less than the subject of the relations between an insolvent or nonpaying ... debtor, and his creditors, extending to his and their relief.' See Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, supra; Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., supra; Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, supra. Such was Story's view also. 'A law on the subject of bankruptcies in the sense of the Constitution is a law making provision for persons failing to pay their debts.' Story, Commentaries on the Constitution,  1113, n. 3. Cf. Warren, op. cit. supra, at page 68. It is not necessary that the debtor have any property to surrender. One may resort to a court of bankruptcy though one has used up all one's property or though what is left is exempt. Vulcan Sheet Metal Co. v. North Platte Valley Irrigation Co. (C.C.A.) 220 F. 106, 108; In re Hirsch (D.C.) 97 F. 571, 573; In re J. M. Ceballos & Co. (D.C.) 161 F. 445, 450. It is enough that, in an omnibus proceeding between a nonpaying debtor on the one side and the creditors on the other, the debtor-creditor relation is to be readjusted or extinguished. Cf. Warren, op. cit. supra, at pages 8, 144.\n Cameron water improvement district No. 1 has no assets to surrender. If it shall turn out hereafter that there are any not exempt, the creditors may have them. Cameron water improvement district No. 1 is a debtor in an amount beyond its capacity for \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 538]\n\u00a0\n payment, and has creditors, the holders of its bonds, who are persuaded that a reduction of the debt will redound to their advantage. Thirty per cent. of the creditors had signified their approval of a proposed plan of composition before the filing of the petition, and 66 2\/3 per cent. must give approval before the judge can act. \n8\n Even then the plan will count for nothing unless the judge upon inquiry shall hold it fair and good. A situation such as this would call very clearly for the exercise by a court of bankruptcy of its distinctive jurisdiction if the debtor were a natural person or a private corporation. Is there anything in the position of a governmental unit that exacts a different conclusion?\n The question is not here whether the statute would be valid if it made provision for involuntary bankruptcy, dispensing with the consent of the state and with that of the bankrupt subdivision. For present purposes one may assume that there would be in such conditions a dislocation of that balance between the powers of the states and the powers of the central government which is essential to our federal system. Cf. Hopkins Federal Savings & Loan Association v. Cleary, \n296 \nU.S. 315\n, 56 S.Ct. 235, 100 A.L.R. 1403; United States v. California, \n297 \nU.S. 175\n, 56 S.Ct. 421. To read into the bankruptcy clause an exception or proviso to the effect that there shall be no disturbance of the federal framework by any bankruptcy proceeding is to do no more than has been done already with reference to the power of taxation by decisions known of all men. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316. The statute now in question does not dislocate the balance. It has been framed with sedulous regard to the structure of the federal system. The governmental units of the state may not act under this statute except through the medium of a voluntary \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 539]\n\u00a0\n petition which will evince their own consent, their own submission to the judicial power. Even that, however, is not enough. By section 80, subdivision (k), 11 U.S.C.A.  303(k), which is quoted in the margin,9 the petition must be accompanied by the written approval of the state, whenever such consent is necessary by virtue of the local law. There is still another safeguard. By subdivision (e)(6), 11 U.S.C.A.  303(e)(6), the composition, though approved by the requisite majority, shall not be confirmed by the judge unless he is satisfied that 'the taxing district is authorized by law, upon confirmation of the plan, to take all action necessary to carry out the plan.' To cap the protective structure, Texas has a statute whereby all municipalities, political subdivisions, and taxing districts in the state are empowered to proceed under the challenged act of Congress, and to do anything appropriate to take advantage of its provisions. This statute became a law on April 27, 1935 ( Texas, Laws 1935, c. 107 (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 1024a)), after the dismissal of the proceeding in the District Court, but before the reversal of that decision by the Court of Appeals. Being law at that time, it was to be considered and applied. United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch, 103, 110; Danforth v. Groton Water \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 540]\n\u00a0\n Co., 178 Mass. 472, 475, 476, 59 N.E. 1033, 86 Am.St.Rep. 495; Robinson v. Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co., 238 N.Y. 271, 281, 144 N.E. 579, 36 A.L.R. 1310. There are like statutes in other states. Arizona, Laws 1935, c. 17; California, St. (Ex.Sess.) 1934, c. 4, p. 5; Florida, Laws 1933, c. 15878; Ohio, Laws (2d Special Session) 1934, No. 77, p. 348. In Texas, at all events, it is clear to the point of demonstration that the filing of a voluntary petition by a political subdivision does not violate the local law or any local public policy. Petitioners are not the champions of any rights except their own. Premier-Pabst Sales Co. v. Grosscup, \n298 \nU.S. 226\n, 56 S.Ct. 754, 80 L.Ed. --, May 18, 1936, New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 160\n, 161 S., 27 S.Ct. 188, 9 Ann.Cas. 736.\n To overcome an act of Congress, invalidity must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 270; Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700\n, 718. Sufficient reasons do n t appear for excluding political subdivisions from the bankruptcy jurisdiction if the jurisdiction is so exerted as to maintain the equilibrium between state and national power. Persuasive analogies tell us that consent will preserve a balance threatened with derangement. A state may not tax the instrumentalities of the central government. It may do so, however, if the central government consents. Baltimore National Bank v. State Tax Commission of Maryland, \n297 \nU.S. 209\n, 56 S.Ct. 417. Reciprocally, the central government, consent being given, may lay a tax upon the states. Cf. United States v. California, supra. So also interference by a state with interstate or foreign commerce may be lawful or unlawful as consent is granted or withheld. In re Rahrer, \n140 \nU.S. 545\n, 11 S.Ct. 865; James Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311\n, 37 S.Ct. 180, L.R.A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 845; Whitfield v. Ohio, \n297 \nU.S. 431\n, 56 S.Ct. 532, march 2, 1936. The prevailing opinion tells us in summing up its conclusions that the bankruptcy power and the taxing power are subject to like limitations when the interests of a state are affected by their action. Let that test be applied, and the act must be upheld, for jurisdiction is withdrawn if the state does not approve. \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 541]\n\u00a0\n Reasons of practical convenience conspire to the same conclusion. If voluntary bankruptcies are anathema for governmental units, municipalities and creditors have been caught in a vise from which it is impossible to let them out. Experience makes it certain that generally there will be at least a small minority of creditors who will resist a composition, however fair and reasonable, if the law does not subject them to a pressure to obey the general will. This is the impasse from which the statute gives relief. 'The controlling purpose of the bill is to provide a forum where distressed cities, counties and minor political subdivisions, designated in the bill as 'taxing districts,' of their own volition, free from all coercion, may meet with their creditors under the necessary judicial control and assistance in an effort to effect an adjustment of their financial matters upon a plan deemed mutually advantageous. If a plan is agreed upon by the taxing district and its creditors holding two-thirds ( in some instances three-fourths) in amount of the claims of each class of indebtedness, and if the court is satisfied that the plan is workable and equitable, it may confirm the plan, and the minority creditors are bound thereby.' Report No. 207, House Judiciary Committee, June 7, 1933. To hold that this purpose must be thwarted by the courts because of a supposed affront to the dignity of a state, though the state disclaims the affront and is doing all it can to keep the law alive, is to make dignity a doubtful blessing. Not by arguments so divorced from the realities of life has the bankruptcy power been brought to the present state of its development during the century and a half of our national existence.\n The act does not authorize the states to impair through their own laws the obligation of existing contracts. Any interference by the states is remote and indirect. Cf. In re Imperial Irrigation District (D.C.) 10 F. Supp. 832, 841. At most what they do is to waive a personal privilege that \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 542]\n\u00a0\n they would be at liberty to claim. Cf. Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co ., \n200 \nU.S. 273, 284\n, 26 S.Ct. 252. If contracts are impaired, the tie is cut or loosened through the action of the court of bankruptcy approving a plan of composition under the authority of federal law. There, and not beyond in an ascending train of antecedents, is the cause of the impairment to which the law will have regard. Cf. Howard Fire Insurance Co. v. Norwich & New York Transportation Co., 12 Wall. 194, 199; Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531, 533\n, 38 S.Ct. 186. Impairment by the central go ernment through laws concerning bankruptcies is not forbidden by the Constitution. Impairment is not forbidden unless effected by the states themselves. No change in obligation results from the filing of a petition by one seeking a discharge, whether a public or a private corporation invokes the jurisdiction. The court, not the petitioner, is the efficient cause of the release.\n The act is not lacking in uniformity because applicable only to such public corporations as have the requisite capacity under the law of the place of their creation. Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, supra, \n186 U.S. 181\n, at page 190, 22 S.Ct. 857; Stellwagen v. Clum, \n245 \nU.S. 605, 613\n, 38 S.Ct. 215. Capacity existing, the rule is uniform for all. Id.\n No question is before us now, and no opinion is intimated, as to the power of Congress to enlarge the privilege of bankruptcy by extending it to the states as well as to the local units. Even if the power exists, there has been no attempt to exercise it. There is room at least for argument that within the meaning of the Constitution the bankruptcy concept does not embrace the states themselves. In the public law of the United States a state is a sovereign or at least a quasi sovereign. Not so a local governmental unit, though the state may have invested it with governmental power. Such a governmental unit may be brought into court against its will \n\n[298 U.S. 513, 543]\n\u00a0\n without violating the Eleventh Amendment. County of Lincoln v. Luning, \n133 \nU.S. 529\n, 10 S.Ct. 363; Hopkins v. Clemson Agricultural College, \n221 \nU.S. 636, 645\n, 31 S.Ct. 654, 657, 35 L.R.A.(N.S .) 243. It may be subjected to mandamus or to equitable remedies. See, e.g ., Norris v. Montezuma Valley Irrigation District (C.C.A.) 248 F. 369, 372; Tyler County v. Town (C.C.A.) 23 F.(2d) 371, 373. 'Neither public corporations nor political subdivisions are clothed with that immunity from suit which belongs to the state alone by virtue of its sovereignty.' Hopkins v. Clemson Agricultural College, supra.\n No question as to the merits of any plan of composition is before us at this time. Abrams v. Van Schaick, \n293 \nU.S. 188\n, 55 S.Ct. 135. Attention, however, may be directed to the fact that by the terms of the statute (section 80, subdivision c(11), 11 U.S.C.A.  303(c)(11), the judge 'shall not, by any order or decree, in the proceeding or otherwise, interfere with (a) any of the political or governmental powers of the taxing district, or (b) any of the property or revenues of the taxing district necessary in the opinion of the judge for essential governmental purposes, or (c) any income-producing property, unless the plan of readjustment so provides,' and that 'the taxing district shall be heard on all question.' These restrictions upon remedies do not take from the statute its quality as one affecting the 'subject of Bankruptcies,' which, as already pointed out, includes a readjustment of the terms of the debtor- creditor relation, though there are no assets to be distributed. On the other hand, the restrictions are important as indicating the care with which the governmental powers of the state and its subdivisions are maintained inviolate.\n The statute is constitutional, and the decree should be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] * Rehearing denied 299 U.S. --, 57 S.Ct. 5, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Originally, this was limited to two years.

Thus, it was at first contended that, constitutionally, such a law must be confined to the lines of the English statute; next, that it could not discharge prior contracts; next, that a purely voluntary law would be nonuniform and therefore unconstitutional; next, that any voluntary bankruptcy was unconstitutional; next, that there could be no discharge of debts of any class except traders; next, that a bankruptcy law could not apply to corporations; next, that allowance of State exemptions of property would make a bankruptcy law non-uniform; next, that any composition was unconstitutional; next, that there could be no composition without an adjudication in bankruptcy; next, that there could be no sale of mortgaged property free from the mortgage.

Stokely, of Birmingham, Ala., for respondent Chemical Bank & Trust Co. \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 315]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On January 4, 1934, the Tennessee Valley Authority, an agency of the federal government,1 entered into a contract with the Alabama Power Company, providing (1) for the purchase by the Authority from the Power Company of certain transmission lines, substations, and auxiliary properties for $1,000,000; (2) for the purchase by the Authority from the Power Company of certain real property for $150,000; (3) for an interchange of hydroelectric energy, and, in addition, for the sale by the Authority to the Power Company of its 'surplus power,' on stated terms; and (4) for mutual restrictions as to the areas to be served in the sale of power. The contract was amended and supplemented in minor particulars on February 13 and May 24, 1934.2\n The Alabama Power Company is a corporation organized under the laws of Alabama, and is engaged in the generation of electric energy and its distribution generally throughout that state; its lines reaching 66 counties. The transmission lines to be purchased by the Authority extend from Wilson Dam, at the Muscle Shoals plant owned by the United States on the Tennessee river in \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 316]\n\u00a0\n northern Alabama, into seven counties in that state, within a radius of about 50 miles. These lines serve a population of approximately 190,000, including about 10,000 individual customers, or about one-tenth of the total number served directly by the Power Company. The real property to be acquired by the Authority (apart from the transmission lines above mentioned and related properties) is adjacent to the area known as the 'Joe Wheeler dam site,' upon which the Authority is constructing the Wheeler Dam.\n The contract of January 4, 1934, also provided for co-operation between the Alabama Power Company and the Electric Home & Farm Authority, Inc., a subsidiary of the Tennessee Valley Authority, to promote the sale of electrical appliances, and to that end the Power Company, on May 21, 1934, entered into an agency contract with the Electric Home & Farm Authority, Inc. It is not necessary to detail or discuss the proceedings in relation to that transaction, as it is understood that the latter corporation has been dissolved.\n There was a further agreement on August 9, 1934, by which the Alabama Power Company gave an option to the Tennessee Valley Authority to acquire urban distribution systems which had been retained by the Power Company in municipalities within the area served by the transmission lines above mentioned. It appears that this option has not been exercised and that the agreement has been terminated.\n Plaintiffs are holders of preferred stock of the Alabama Power Company. Conceiving the contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to be injurious to the corporate interests and also invalid, because beyond the constitutional power of the federal government, they submitted their protest to the board of directors of the Power Company and demanded that steps should be taken to have the contract annulled. The board refused, and the \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 317]\n\u00a0\n Commonwealth & Southern Corporation, the holder of all the common stock of the Power Company, declined to call a meeting of the stockholders to take action. As the protest was unavailing, plaintiffs brought this suit to have the invalidity of the contract determined and its performance enjoined. Going beyond that particular challenge, and setting forth the pronouncements, policies, and programs of the Authority, plaintiffs sought a decree restraining these activities as repugnant to the Constitution, and also asked a general declaratory decree with respect to the rights of the Authority in various relations.\n The defendants, including the Authority and its directors, the Power Company and its mortgage trustee, and the municipalities within the described area, filed answers, and the case was heard upon evidence. The District Court made elaborate findings and entered a final decree annulling the contract of January 4, 1934, and enjoining the transfer of the transmission lines and auxiliary properties. 9 F.Supp. 965. The court also enjoined the defendant municipalities from making or performing any contracts with the Authority for the purchase of power and from accepting or expending any funds received from the Authority or the Public Works Administration for the purpose of constructing a public distribution system to distribute power which the Authority supplied. The court gave no consideration to plaintiffs' request for a general declaratory decree.\n The Authority, its directors, and the city of Florence appealed from the decree and the case was severed as to the other defendants. Plaintiffs took a cross-appeal.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals limited its discussion to the precise issue with respect to the effect and validity of the contract of January 4, 1934. The District Court had found that the electric energy required for the territory served by the transmission lines to be purchased \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 318]\n\u00a0\n under that contract is available at Wilson Dam without the necessity for any interconnection with any other dam or power plant. The Circuit Court of Appeals accordingly considered the constitutional authority for the construction of Wilson Dam and for the disposition of the electric energy there created. In the view that the Wilson Dam had been constructed in the exercise of the war and commerce powers of the Congress and that the electric energy there available was the property of the United States and subject to its disposition, the Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the decree of the District Court was erroneous and should be reversed. The court also held that plaintiffs should take nothing by their cross-appeal. 78 F.(2d) 578. On plaintiffs' application we granted writs of certiorari. \n296 \nU.S. 562\n, 56 S.Ct. 145.\n First. The Right of Plaintiffs to Bring this Suit. Plaintiffs sue in the right of the Alabama Power Company. They sought unsuccessfully to have that right asserted by the Power Company itself, and, upon showing their demand and its refusal, they complied with the applicable rule. \n3\n While their stock holdings are small, they have a real interest, and there is no question that the suit was brought in good faith. \n4\n If otherwise entitled, they should not be denied the relief which would be accorded to one who owned more shares.\n Plaintiffs did not simply challenge the contract of January 4, 1934, as improvidently made-as an unwise exercise of the discretion vested in the board of directors. They challenged the contract both as injurious to the \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 319]\n\u00a0\n interests of the interests of the corporation and as an illegal tran action-violating the fundamental law. In seeking to prevent the carrying out of the contract, the suit was directed, not only against the Power Company, but against the Authority and its directors upon the ground that the latter, under color of the statute, were acting beyond the powers which the Congress could validly confer. In such a case it is not necessary for stockholders-when their corporation refuses to take suitable measures for its protection-to show that the managing board or trustees have acted with fraudulent intent or under legal duress. To entitle the complainants to equitable relief, in the absence of an adequate legal remedy, it is enough for them to show the breach of trust or duty involved in the injurious and illegal action. Nor is it necessary to show that the transaction was ultra vires the corporation. The illegality may be found in the lack of lawful authority on the part of those with whom the corporation is attempting to deal. Thus, the breach of duty may consist in yielding, without appropriate resistance, to governmental demands which are without warrant of law or are in violation of constitutional restrictions. The right of stockholders to seek equitable relief has been recognized when the managing board or trustees of the corporation have refused to take legal measures to resist the collection of taxes or other exactions alleged to be unconstitutional (Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331, 339, 340, 345; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, \n157 \nU.S. 429, 433\n, 553 S., 554, 15 S.Ct. 673; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 36 S.Ct. 236, L.R.A. 1917D, 414, Ann.Cas. 1917B, 713); or because of the failure to assert the rights and franchises of the corporation against an unwarranted interference through legislative or administrative action (Greenwood v. Union Freight R. Co., \n105 \nU.S. 13, 15\n, 16 S.; Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co., \n183 \nU.S. 79, 114\n, 22 S.Ct. 30). The remedy has been accorded to stockholders of public service corporations with respect to rates alleged to be con- \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 320]\n\u00a0\n fiscatory. Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 469\n, 517 S., 18 S.Ct. 418; Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 129\n, 130 S., 143, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764. The fact that the directors in the exercise of their judgment, either because they were disinclined to undertake a burdensome litigation or for other reasons which they regarded as substantial, resolved to comply with the legislative or administrative demands, has not been deemed an adequate ground for denying to the stockholders an opportunity to contest the validity of the governmental requirements to which the directors were submitting. See Dodge v. Woolsey, supra, 18 How. 331, at pages 340, 345; Greenwood v. Union Freight R. Co., supra, \n105 U.S. 13\n, at page 15; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, supra, \n157 U.S. 429\n, at pages 433, 553, 554, 15 S.Ct. 673; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., supra, \n240 U.S. 1\n, at page 10, 36 S.Ct. 236, L.R.A. 1917D, 414, Ann.Cas. 1917B, 713.\n In Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Company, \n255 \nU.S. 180\n, 41 S.Ct. 243, a shareholder of the Title Company sought to enjoin the directors from investing its funds in the bonds of federal land banks and joint-stock land banks upon the ground that the act of Congress authorizing the creation of these banks and the issue of bonds was unconstitutional, and hence that the bonds were not legal securities in which the corporate funds could lawfully be invested. The proposed investment was not large-only $10,000 in each of the classes of bonds described. Id., \n255 U.S. 180\n, at pages 195, 196, 41 S.Ct. 243. And it appeared that the directors of the Title Company maintained that the Federal Farm Loan Act (see 12 U.S.C.A.  641 et seq.) was constitutional and that the bonds were 'valid and desirable investments.' Id., \n255 U.S. 180\n, at page 201, 41 S.Ct. 243, 45. But neither the conceded fact as to the judgment of the directors nor the small amount to be invested-shown by the averments of the complaint- availed to defeat the jurisdiction of the court to decide the question as to the validity of the act and of the bonds which it authorized. The Court held that the validity of the act was directly drawn in question and that the shareholder was entitled to maintain the suit. The Court said: 'The general allegations as to the interest of the \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 321]\n\u00a0\n shareholder, and his right to have an injunction to prevent the purchase of the alleged unconstitutional securities by misapplication of the funds of the corporation, gives jurisdiction under the principles settled in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. and Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., supra.' Id., \n255 U.S. 180\n, at pages 201, 202, 41 S.Ct. 243, 246. The Court then proceeded to examine the constitutional question and sustained the legislation under attack. A similar result was reached in Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., supra. A close examination of these decisions leads inevitably to the conclusion that they should either be followed or be frankly overruled. We think that they should be followed, and that the opportunity to resort to equity, in the absence of an adequate legal remedy, in order to prevent illegal transactions by those in control of corporate properties, should not be curtailed because of reluctance to decide constitutional questions.\n We find no distinctions which would justify us in refusing to entertain the present controversy. It is urged that plaintiffs hold preferred shares, and that, for the present purpose, they are virtually in the position of bondholders. The rights of bondholders, in case of injury to their interests through unconstitutional demands upon, or transactions with, their corporate debtor, are not before us. Compare Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 367\n, 368 S., 14 S.Ct. 1047. Plaintiffs are not creditors but shareholders (with equal voting power share for share with the common stockholders, according to the findings), and thus they have a proprietary interest in the corporate enterprise which is subject to injury through breaches of trust or duty on the part of the directors who are not less the representatives of the plaintiffs because their shares have certain preferences. See Ball v. Rutland R. Co. (C.C.) 93 F. 513, 514, 515. It may be, as in this case, that the owner of all the common stock has participated in the transaction in question, and the owners of preferred \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 322]\n\u00a0\n stock may be the only persons having a proprietary interest in the corporation who are in a position to protect its interests against what is asserted to be an illegal disposition of its property. \n5\n A court of equity should not shut its door against them.\n It is said that here, instead of parting with money, as in the case of illegal or unconstitutional taxes or exactions, the Power Company is to receive a substantial consideration under the contract in suit. But the Power Company is to part with transmission lines which supply a large area, and plaintiffs allege that the consideration is inadequate and that the transaction entails a disruption of services and a loss of business and franchises. If, as plaintiffs contend, those purporting to act as a governmental agency had no constitutional authority to make the agreement, its execution would leave the Power Company with doubtful remedy, either against the governmental agency which might not be able, or against the government which might not be willing, to respond to a demand for the restoration of conditions as they now exist. In what circumstances and with what result such an effort at restoration might be made is unpredictable. If, as was decided in Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Company, supra, stockholders had the right to sue to test the validity of a proposed investment in the bonds of land banks, we can see no reason for denying to these p aintiffs a similar resort to equity in order to challenge, on the ground of unconstitutionality, a contract involving such a dislocation and misapplication of corporate property as are charged in the instant case.\n The government urges that the Power Company is estopped to question the validity of the act creating the Tennessee Valley Authority, and hence that the stockholders, suing in the right of the corporation, cannot \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 323]\n\u00a0\n maintain this suit. It is said that the Power Company, in 1925, installed its own transformers and connections at Wilson Dam, and has ever since purchased large quantities of electric energy there generated, and that the Power Company continued its purchases after the passage of the act of 1933 constituting the Authority. The principle is invoked that one who accepts the benefit of a statute cannot be heard to question its constitutionality. Great Falls Manufacturing Co. v. Attorney General, \n124 \nU.S. 581\n, 8 S.Ct. 631; Wall v. Parrot Silver & Copper Co., \n244 \nU.S. 407\n, 37 S.Ct. 609; St. Louis, etc., Co., v. George C. Prendergast Const. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 469\n, 43 S.Ct. 178. We think that the principle is not applicable here. The prior purchase of power in the circumstances disclosed may have a bearing upon the question before us, but it is by no means controlling. The contract in suit manifestly has a broader range, and we find nothing in the earlier transactions which preclude the contention that this contract goes beyond the constitutional power of the Authority. Reference is also made to a proceeding instituted by the Power Company to obtain the approval of the contract by the Alabama Public Service Commission and to the delay in the bringing of this suit. It was brought on October 8, 1934, following plaintiffs' demand upon the board of directors in the preceding August. Estoppel in equity must rest on substantial grounds of prejudice or change of position, not on technicalities. We see no reason for concluding that the delay or the proceeding before the Commission caused any prejudice to either the Power Company or the Authority, so far as the subject-matter of the contract between them is concerned, or that there is any basis for the claim of estoppel.\n We think that plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing to entitle them to bring suit and that a constitutional question is property presented and should be decided. \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 324]\n\u00a0\n Second. The Scope of the Issue. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the question to be determined is limited to the validity of the contract of January 4, 1934. The pronouncements, policies, and program of the Tennessee Valley Authority and its directors, their motives and desires, did not give rise to a justiciable controversy save as they had fruition in action of a definite and concrete character constituting an actual or threatened interference with the rights of the persons complaining. The judicial power does not extend to the determination of abstract questions. Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346, 361\n, 31 S.Ct. 250; Liberty Warehouse Company v. Grannis, \n273 \nU.S. 70, 74\n, 47 S.Ct. 282; Willing v. Chicago Auditorium Ass'n, \n277 \nU.S. 274, 289\n, 48 S.Ct. 507; Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 262\n, 264 S., 53 S.Ct. 345, 87 A.L. R. 1191. It was for this reason that the Court dismissed the bill of the state of New Jersey which sought to obtain a judicial declaration that in certain features the Federal Water Power Act6 exceeded the authority of the Congress and encroached upon that of the state. New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328\n, 46 S.Ct. 122. For the same reason, the state of New York, in her suit against the state of Illinois, failed in her effort to obtain a decision of abstract questions as to the possible effect of the diversion of water from Lake Michigan upon hypothetical water power developments in the indefinite future. New York v. Illinois, 274 U S. 488, 47 S.Ct. 661. At the last term the Court held, in dismissing the bill of the United States against the state of West Virginia, that general allegations that the state challenged the claim of the United States that the rivers in question were navigable, and asserted a right superior to that of the United States to license their use for power production, raised an issue 'too vague and ill-defined to admit of judicial determination.' United States v. State of West Virginia, \n295 \nU.S. 463, 474\n, 55 S.Ct. 789. Claims based merely upon 'assumed potential invasions' \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 325]\n\u00a0\n of rights are not enough to warrant judicial intervention. Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 462\n, 51 S.Ct. 522\n\n\n The Act of June 14, 1934,7 providing for declaratory judgments, does not attempt to change the essential requisites for the exercise of judicial power. By its terms, it applies to 'cases of actual controversy,' a phrase which must be taken to connote a controversy of a justiciable nature, thus excluding an advisory decree upon a hypothetical state of facts. See Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, supra. While plaintiffs, as stockholders, might insist that the board of directors should take appropriate legal measures to extricate the corporation from particular transactions and agreements alleged to be invalid, plaintiffs had no right to demand that the directors should start a litigation to obtain a general declaration of the unconstitutionality of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act in all its bearings or a decision of abstract questions as to the right of the Authority and of the Alabama Power Company in possible contingencies.\n Examining the present record, we find no ground for a demand by plaintiffs except as it related to the contracts between the authority and the Alabama Power Company. And as the contract of May 21, 1934, with the Electric Home & Farm Authority, Inc., and that of August 9, 1934, for an option to the Authority to acquire urban distribution systems, are understood to be inoperative (56 S.Ct. 469), the only remaining questions that plaintiffs are entitled to raise concern the contract of January 4, 1934, providing for the purchase of transmission lines and the disposition of power.\n There is a further limitation upon our inquiry. As it appears that the transmission lines in question run from the Wilson Dam and that the electric energy generated at that dam is more than sufficient to supply all the re- \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 326]\n\u00a0\n quirements of the contract, the questions that are properly before us relate to the constitutional authority for the construction of the Wilson Dam and for the disposition, as provided in the contract, of the electric energy there generated.\n Third. The Constitutional Authority for the Construction of the Wilson Dam. The Congress may not, 'under the pretext of executing its powers, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the government.' Chief Justice Marshall, in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 423; Linder v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 5, 15\n, 17 S., 45 S. Ct. 446, 39 A.L.R. 229. The government's argument recognizes this essential limitation. The government's contention is that the Wilson Dam was constructed, and the power plant connected with it was installed, in the exercise by the Congress of its war and commerce powers (Const. art. 1,  8, cls. 3, 11); that is, for the purposes of national defense and the improvement of navigation.\n Wilson Dam is described as a concrete monolith one hundred feet high and almost a mile long, containing two locks for navigation and eight installed generators. Construction was begun in 1917 and completed in 1926. Authority for its construction is found in section 124 of the National Defense Act of June 3, 1916.8 It authorized the President to cause an investigation to be made in order to determine 'the best, cheapest, and ost available means for the production of nitrates and other products for munitions of war'; to designate for the exclusive use of the United States 'such site or sites, upon any navigable or non-navigable river or rivers or upon the public lands, as in his opinion will be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this Act (section)'; and 'to construct, maintain, and operate' on any such site 'dams, locks, improvements to navigation, power houses, and other plants and equipment or other \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 327]\n\u00a0\n means than water power as in his judgment is the best and cheapest, necessary or convenient for the generation of electrical or other power and for the production of nitrates or other products needed for munitions of war and useful in the manufacture of fertilizers and other useful products.' The President was authorized to lease or acquire by condemnation or otherwise such lands as might be necessary, and there was further provision that 'the products of such plants shall be used by the President for military and naval purposes to the extent that he may deem necessary, and any surplus which he shall determine is not required shall be sold and disposed of by him under such regulations as he may prescribe.' Id.\n We may take judicial notice of the international situation at the time the act of 1916 was passed, and it cannot be successfully disputed that the Wilson Dam and its auxiliary plants, including the hydroelectric power plant, are, and were intended to be, adapted to the purposes of national defense. \n9\n While the District Court found that there is no intention to use the nitrate plants or the hydroelectric units installed at Wilson Dam for the production \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 328]\n\u00a0\n of war materials in time of peace, 'the maintenance of said properties in operating condition and the assurance of an abundant supply of electric energy in the event of war, constitute national defense assets.' This finding has ample support.\n The act of 1916 also had in view 'improvements to navigation.' Commerce includes navigation. 'All America understands, and has uniformly understood,' said Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 190, 'the word 'commerce,' to comprehend navigation.' The power to regulate interstate commerce embraces the power to keep the navigable rivers of the United States free from obstructions to navigation and to remove such obstructions when they exist. 'For these purposes,' said the Court in Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 713, 725, 'Congress possesses all the powers which existed in the States before the adoption of the national Constitution, and which have always existed in the Parliament in England.' See, also, Philadelphia Company v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 634\n, 32 S.Ct. 340.\n The Tennessee river is a navigable stream, although there are obstructions at various points because of shoals, reefs, and rapids. The improvement of navigation on this river has been a matter of national concern for over a century. Recommendation that provision be made for \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 329]\n\u00a0\n navigation around Muscle Shoals was made by the Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun, in his report transmitted to the Congress by President Monroe in 1824,10 and, from 1852, the Congress has repeatedly authorized projects to develop navigation on that and other portions of the river, both by open channel improvements and by canalization. \n11\n The Wilson Dam project, adopted in 1918, gave a nine-foot slack water development, for fifteen miles above Florence, over the Muscle Shoals rapids, and, as the District Court found, 'flooded out the them existing canal and locks which were inadequate.' The District Court also found that a 'high dam of this type was the only feasible means of eliminating this most serious obstruction to navigation.' By the act of 1930, after a protracted study by the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army, the Congress adopted a project for a permanent improvement of the main stream 'for a navigable depth of nine feet.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n While, in its present condition, the Tennessee river is not adequately improved for commercial navigation, and traffic is small, we are not at liberty to conclude either that the river is not susceptible of development as an important waterway, or that Congress has not undertaken \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 330]\n\u00a0\n that development, or that the construction of the Wilson Dam was not an appropriate means to accomplish a legitimate end.\n The Wilson Dam and its power plant must be taken to have been constructed in the exercise of the constitutional functions of the federal government.\n Fourth. The Constitutional Authority to Dispose of Electric Energy Generated at the Wilson Dam. The government acquired full title to the dam site, with all riparian rights. The power of falling water was an inevitable incident of the construction of the dam. That water power came into the exclusive control of the federal government. The mechanical energy was convertible into electric energy, and the water power, the right to convert it into electric energy, and the electric energy thus produced constitute property belonging to the United States. See Green Bay & M. Canal Company v. Patten Paper Company, \n172 \nU.S. 58, 80\n, 19 S.Ct. 97, 101; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Company, \n229 \nU.S. 53, 72\n, 73 S., 33 S.Ct. 667; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 170\n, 52 S.Ct. 548.\n Autho ity to dispose of property constitutionally acquired by the United States is expressly granted to the Congress by section 3 of article 4 of the Constitution. This section provides:\n'The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.'\n\n To the extent that the power of disposition is thus expressly conferred, it is manifest that the Tenth Amendment is not applicable. And the Ninth Amendment (which petitioners also invoke), in insuring the maintenance of the rights retained by the people, does not withdraw the rights which are expressly granted to the \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 331]\n\u00a0\n federal government. The question is as to the scope of the grant and whether there are inherent limitations which render invalid the disposition of property with which we are now concerned.\n The occasion for the grant was the obvious necessity of making provision for the government of the vast territory acquired by the United States. The power to govern and to dispose of that territory was deemed to be indispensable to the purposes of the cessions made by the States. And yet it was a matter of grave concern because of the fear that 'the sale and disposal' might become 'a source of such immense revenue to the national government as to make it independent of and formidable to the people.' Story on the Constitution,  1325, 1326. The grant was made in broad terms, and the power of regulation and disposition was not confined to territory, but extended to 'other property belonging to the United States,' so that the power may be applied, as Story says, 'to the due regulation of all other personal and real property rightfully belonging to the United States.' And so, he adds, 'it has been constantly understood and acted upon.' Id.\n This power of disposal was early construed to embrace leases, thus enabling the government to derive profit through royalties. The question arose with respect to a government lease of lead mines on public lands, under the Act of March 3, 1807 (2 Stat. 448). The contention was advanced that 'disposal is not letting or leasing'; that Congress had no power 'to give or authorize leases' and 'to obtain profits from the working of the mines.' The Court overruled the contention, saying: 'The disposal must be left to the discretion of Congress. And there can be no apprehensions of any encroachments upon State rights, by the creation of a numerous tenantry within their borders, as has been so strenuously urged in the argument.' United States v. Gratiot, 14 Pet. 526, 533, 538. The policy, early \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 332]\n\u00a0\n adopted and steadily pursued, of segregating mineral lands from other public lands and providing for leases, pointed to the recognition both of the full power of disposal and of the necessity of suitably adapting the methods of disposal to different sorts of property. The policy received particular emphasis following the discovery of gold in California in 1848. 13 For example, an act of 1866, dealing with grants to Nevada, declared that 'in all cases lands valuable for mines of gold, silver, quicksilver, or copper shall be reserved from sale.' \n14\n And Congress from the outset adopted a similar practice in reserving salt springs. Morton v. Nebraska, 21 Wall. 660, 667; Montello Salt Company v. Utah, \n221 \nU.S. 452\n, 31 S.Ct. 706, Ann.Cas.1912D, 633. It was in the light of this historic policy that the Court held that the school grant to Utah by the Enabling Act of 189415 was not intended to embrace land known to be valuable for coal. United States v. Sweet, \n245 \nU.S. 563, 572\n, 38 S.Ct. 193. See, also, as to the reservation and leases of oil lands, Pan American Petroleum & Transport Co. v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 456, 487\n, 47 S.Ct. 416.\n But, when Congress thus reserved mineral lands for special disposal, can it be doubted that Congress could have provided for mining directly by its own agents, instead of giving that right to lessees on the payment of royalties? 16 Upon what ground could it be said that the government could not mine its own gold, silver, coal, lead, or phosphates in the public domain and dispose of them as property belonging to the United States? That it could dis- \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 333]\n\u00a0\n pose of its land but not of what the land contained? It would seem to be clear that under the same power of disposition which enabled the government to lease and obtain profit from sales by its lessees it could mine and obtain profit from its own sales.\n The question is whether a more limited power of disposal should be applied to the water power, convertible into electric energy, and to the electric energy thus produced at the Wilson Dam constructed by the government in the exercise of its constitutional functions. If so, it must be by reason either of (1) the nature of the particular property or (2) the character of the 'surplus' disposed of, or (3) the manner of disposition.\n\n\n (1)\n That the water power and the electric energy generated at the dam are susceptible of disposition as property belonging to the United States is well established. In the case of Green Bay & M. Canal Company v. Patten Paper Company, supra, the question was 'whether the water power incidentally created by the erection and maintenance of the dam and canal for the purpose of navigation in Fox river' was 'subject to control and appropriation by the United States, owning and operating those public works, or by the state of Wisconsin, within whose limits Fox river lies.' Id., \n172 U.S. 58\n, at pages 68, 69, 19 S.Ct. 97, 101. It appeared that, under the authority of the Congress, the United States had acquired, by purchase from a Canal Company, title to its improvement works, lands and water powers, on the Fox river, and that the United States had consented to the retention by the Canal Company of the water powers with appurtenances. We held that the 'substantial meaning of the transaction was that the United States granted to the Canal Company the right to continue in the possession and enjoyment of the water powers and the lots appurtenant thereto, subject to the rights and control of the United States as owning and operating the public works'; and that the method by which the arrangement was \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 334]\n\u00a0\n effected was 'as efficacious as if the entire property had been conveyed to the United States by one deed, and the reserved properties had been reconveyed to the Canal Company by another.' Id., \n172 U.S. 58\n, at page 80, 19 S.Ct. 97, 105. We thought it clear that the Canal Company was 'possessed of whatever rights to the use of this incidental water power that could be validly granted by the United States.' Id., \n172 U.S. 58\n, at page 69, 19 S.Ct. 97, 101. And in this view it was decided that, so far as the 'water powers and appurtenant lots are regarded as property,' the title of the Canal Company could not be controverted, and that it was 'equally plain that the mode and extent of the use and enjoyment of such property by the Canal Company' fell within the sole control of the United States. See Kaukauna Water-Power Company v. Green Bay & M. Canal Company, \n142 \nU.S. 254\n, 12 S.Ct. 173, 178; Green Bay & M. Canal Company v. Patten Paper Company, \n173 \nU.S. 179\n, 19 S.Ct. 316.\n In United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Company, \n229 \nU.S. 53\n, 33 S.Ct. 667, the United States had condemned land in Michigan, lying between the St. Marys river and the ship canal strip of the government, in order to improve navigation. The riparian owner, under revocable permits from the Secretary of War, had placed in the rapids 'the necessary dams, dykes, and forebays for the purpose of controlling the current and using its power for commercial purposes.' Id., \n229 U.S. 53\n, at page 68, 33 S.Ct. 667, 674. The Act of March 3, 1909,17 authorizing the improvement, had revoked the permit. We said that the government 'had dominion over the water power of the rapids and falls' and could not be required to pay 'any hypothetical additional value to a riparian owner who had no right to appropriate the current to his own commercial use.' Id., \n229 U.S. 53\n, at page 76, 33 S.Ct. 667, 677. The act of 1909 also authorized the Secretary of War to lease 'any excess of water power which results from the conservation of the flow of the river, and the works which the government may con- \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 335]\n\u00a0\n struct.' 'If the primary purpose is legitimate,' said the Court, 'we can see no sound objection to leasing any excess of power over the needs of the government. The practice is not unusual in respect to similar public works constructed by state governments.' Id., \n229 U.S. 53\n, at page 73, 33 S.Ct. 667, 676. Reference was made to the case of Kaukauna Water-Power Company v. Green Bay & M. Canal Company, supra, where the Court had observed in relation to a Wisconsin statute of 1848, which had reserved to the state the water power created by the dam over the Fox river: 'As there is no need of the surplus running to waste, there was nothing objectionable in permitting the state to let out the use of it to private parties, and thus reimburse itself for the expenses of the improvement.' In International Paper Company v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 399\n, 51 S.Ct. 176, the government made a war-time requisition of electrical power, and was held bound to make compensation to a lessee who thereby had lost the use of the water to which he was entitled. The Court brushed aside attempted 'distinctions between the taking of power and the taking of water rights,' saying that the government intended 'to take and did take the use of all the water power' and had exercised its power of eminent domain to that end. Id., \n282 U.S. 399\n, at pages 407, 408, 51 S.Ct. 176, 177.\n\n\n (2)\n The argument is stressed that, assuming that electric energy generated at the dam belongs to the United States, the Congress has authority to dispose of this energy only to the extent that it is a surplus necessarily created in the course of making munitions of war or operating the works for navigation purposes; that is, that the remainder of the available energy must be lost or go to waste. We find nothing in the Constitution which imposes such a limitation. It is not to be deduced from the mere fact that the electric energy is only potentially available until the generators are operated. The government has no less right to the energy thus available by letting the water course over its turbines than it has \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 336]\n\u00a0\n to use the appropriate processes to reduce to possession other property within its control, as, for example, oil which it may recover from a pool beneath its lands, and which is reduced to possession by boring oil wells and otherwise might escape its grasp. See Ohio Oil Company v. Indiana, \n177 \nU.S. 190, 208\n, 20 S.Ct. 576. And it would hardly be contended that, when the government reserves coal on its lands, it can mine the coal and dispose of it only for the purpose of heating public buildings or for other governmental operations. Or, if the government owns a silver mine, that it can obtain the silver only for the purpose of storage or coinage. Or that, when the government extracts the oil it has reserved, it has no constituti nal power to sell it. Our decisions recognize no such restriction. United States v. Gratiot, supra; Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 88\n, 89 S., 27 S.Ct. 655; Light v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 523, 536\n, 537 S., 31 S.Ct. 485; Ruddy v. Rossi, \n248 \nU.S. 104, 106\n, 39 S.Ct. 46, 8 A.L.R. 843. The United States owns the coal, or the silver, or the lead, or the oil, it obtains from its lands, and it lies in the discretion of the Congress, acting in the public interest, to determine of how much of the property it shall dispose.\n We think that the same principle is applicable to electric energy. The argument pressed upon us leads to absurd consequences in the denial, despite the broad terms of the constitutional provision, of a power of disposal which the public interest may imperatively require. Suppose, for example, that in the erection of a dam for the improvement of navigation, it became necessary to destroy a dam and power plant which had previously been erected by a private corporation engaged in the generation and distribution of energy which supplied the needs of neighboring communities and business enterprises. Would any one say that, because the United States had built its own dam and plant in the exercise of its constitutional functions, and had complete ownership and dominion over both, no power could be supplied to the communities and enterprises dependent on it, not because of \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 337]\n\u00a0\n any unwillingness of the Congress to supply it, or of any overriding governmental need, but because there was no constitutional authority to furnish the supply? Or that, with abundant power available, which must otherwise be wasted, the supply to the communities and enterprises whose very life may be at stake must be limited to the slender amount of surplus unavoidably involved in the operation of the navigation works, because the Constitution does not permit any more energy to be generated and distributed? In the case of the Green Bay & M. Canal Company, above cited, where the government works supplanted those of the Canal Company, the Court found no difficulty in sustaining the government's authority to grant to the Canal Company the water powers which it had previously enjoyed, subject, of course, to the dominant control of the government. And in the case of United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Company, supra, the statutory provision (35 Stat. 822,  12) to which the Court referred was 'that any excess of water in the St. Marys River at Sault Sainte Marie over and above the amount now or hereafter required for the uses of navigation shall be leased for power purposes by the Secretary of War upon such terms and conditions as shall be best calculated in his judgment to insure the development thereof.' It was to the leasing, under this provision, of 'any excess of power over the needs of the government,' that the Court saw no valid objection. Id., \n229 U.S. 53\n, at page 73, 33 S. Ct. 667, 676.\n The decisions which petitioners cite give no support to their contention. Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 \nU.S. 1\n, 14 S.Ct. 548, and Port of Seattle v. Oregon & Washington Railway Co., \n255 \nU.S. 56\n, 41 S.Ct. 237, dealt with the title of the States to tidelands and the soil under navigable waters within their borders. See Borax Consolidated v. Los Angeles, \n296 \nU.S. 10, 15\n, 56 S.Ct. 23. Those cases did not concern the dominant authority of the federal government in the interest of navigation to erect dams and avail itself of the incidental water power. We emphasized the dominant character of that authority in the case of \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 338]\n\u00a0\n the Green Bay & M. Canal Company v. Patten Paper Co., supra, \n172 U.S. 58\n, at page 80, 19 S.Ct. 97, 105, by this statement: 'At what points in the dam and canal the water for power may be withdrawn, and the quantity which can be treated as surplus with due regard to navigation, must be determined by the authority which owns and c ntrols that navigation. In such matters there can be no divided empire.' The case of Wisconsin v. Illinois, \n278 \nU.S. 367\n, 49 S.Ct. 163, related to the diversion by the state of Illinois of water from Lake Michigan through the drainage canal at Chicago, and the questions now before us with respect to the disposition of surplus energy created at a dam erected by the federal government in the performance of its constitutional functions were in no way involved.\n\n\n (3)\n We come then to the question as to the validity of the method which has been adopted in disposing of the surplus energy generated at the Wilson Dam. The constitutional provision is silent as to the method of disposing of property belonging to the United States. That method, of course, must be an appropriate means of disposition according to the nature of the property, it must be one adopted in the public interest as distinguished from private or personal ends, and we may assume that it must be consistent with the foundation principles of our dual system of government and must not be contrived to govern the concerns reserved to the States. See Kansas v. Colorado, supra. In this instance, the method of disposal embraces the sale of surplus energy by the Tennessee Valley Authority to the Alabama Power Company, the interchange of energy between the Authority and the Power Company, and the purchase by the Authority from the Power Company of certain transmission lines.\n As to the mere sale of surplus energy, nothing need be added to what we have said as to the constitutional authority to dispose. The government could lease or sell and fix the terms. Sales of surplus energy to the Power Company by the Authority continued a practice begun by the government several years before. The contemplated \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 339]\n\u00a0\n interchange of energy is a form of disposition, and presents no questions which are essentially different from those that are pertinent to sales.\n The transmission lines which the Authority undertakes to purchase from the Power Company lead from the Wilson Dam to a large area within about fifty miles of the dam. These lines provide the means of distributing the electric energy, generated at the dam, to a large population. They furnish a method of reaching a market. The alternative method is to sell the surplus energy at the dam, and the market there appears to be limited to one purchaser, the Alabama Power Company, and its affiliated interests. We know of no constitutional ground upon which the federal government can be denied the right to seek a wider market. We suppose that in the early days of mining in the West, if the government had undertaken to operate a silver mine on its domain, it could have acquired the mules or horses and equipment to carry its silver to market. And the transmission lines for electric energy are but a facility for conveying to market that particular sort of property, and the acquisition of these lines raises no different constitutional question, unless in some way there is an invasion of the rights reserved to the state or to the people. We find no basis for concluding that the limited undertaking with the Alabama Power Company amounts to such an invasion. Certainly, the Alabama Power Company has no constitutional right to insist that it shall be the sole purchaser of the energy generated at the Wilson Dam; that the energy shall be sold to it or go to waste.\n We limit our decision to the case before us, as we have defined it. The argument is earnestly presented that the government by virtue of its ownership of the dam and power plant could not establish a steel mill and make and sell steel products, or a factory to manufacture clothing or shoes for the public, and thus attempt to make its \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 340]\n\u00a0\n ownership of energy, generated at its dam, a means of carrying on competitive commercial enterprises, and thus drawing to the federal government the conduct and management of business having no relation to the purposes for which the federal government was established. The picture is eloquently dr wn, but we deem it to be irrelevant to the issue here. The government is not using the water power at the Wilson Dam to establish any industry or business. It is not using the energy generated at the dam to manufacture commodities of any sort for the public. The government is disposing of the energy itself which simply is the mechanical energy, incidental to falling water at the dam, converted into the electric energy which is susceptible of transmission. The question here is simply as to the acquisition of the transmission lines as a facility for the disposal of that energy. And the government rightly conceded at the bar, in substance, that it was without constitutional authority to acquire or dispose of such energy except as it comes into being in the operation of works constructed in the exercise of some power delegated to the United States. As we have said, these transmission lines lead directly from the dam, which has been lawfully constructed, and the question of the constitutional right of the government to acquire or operate local or urban distribution systems is not involved. We express no opinion as to the validity of such an effort, as to the status of any other dam or power development in the Tennessee Valley, whether connected with or apart from the Wilson Dam, or as to the validity of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act or of the claims made in the pronouncements and program of the Authority apart from the questions we have discussed in relation to the particular provisions of the contract of January 4, 1934, affecting the Alabama Power Company.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 341]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (concurring).\n'Considerations of propriety, as well as long-established practice, demand that we refrain from passing upon the constitutionality of an act of Congress unless obliged to do so in the proper performance of our judicial function, when the question is raised by a party whose interests entitle him to raise it.' Blair v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 273, 279\n, 39 S. Ct. 468, 470.\n\n I do not disagree with the conclusion on the constitutional question announced by the CHIEF JUSTICE; but, in my opinion, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed without passing upon it. The government has insisted throughout the litigation that the plaintiffs have no standing to challenge the validity of the legislation. This objection to the maintenance of the suit is not overcome by presenting the claim in the form of a bill in equity and complying with formal prerequisites required by Equity Rule 27 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723). The obstacle is not procedural. It inheres in the substantive law, in well- settled rules of equity, and in the practice in cases involving the constitutionality of legislation. Upon the findings made by the District Court, it should have dismissed the bill.\n From these it appears: The Alabama Power Company, a corporation of that state with transmission lines located there, has outstanding large issues of bonds, preferred stock, and common stock. Its officers agreed, with the approval of the board of directors, to sell to the Tennessee Valley Authority a part of these lines and incidental property. The management thought that the transaction was in the interest of the company. It acted in the exercise of its business judgment with the utmost good faith. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[297 U.S. 288, 342]\n\u00a0\n There was no showing of fraud, oppression, or gross negligence. There was no showing of legal duress. There was no showing that the management believed that to sell to the Tennessee Valley Authority was in excess of the company's corporate powers, or that it was illegal because entered into for a forbidden purpose.\n Nor is there any basis in law for the assertion that the contract was ultra vires the company. Under the law of Alabama, a public utility corporation may ordinarily sell a part of its transmission lines and incidental property to another such corporation if the approval of the Public Service Commission is obtained. The contract provided for securing such approval. Moreover, before the motion to dissolve the restraining order was denied, and before the hearing on the merits was concluded, the Legislature, by Act No. 1, approved January 24, 1935 (Gen.Acts Ala.1935, p. 1) and effective immediately, provided that a utility of the state may sell all or any of its property to the Tennessee Valley Authority without the approval of the Public Service Commission or of any other state agency.\n First. The substantive law. The plaintiffs who object own about 1\/340 of the preferred stock. They claimed at the hearing to represent about 1\/9 of the preferred stock; that is, less than 1\/45 in amount of all the securities outstanding. Their rights are not enlarged because the Tennessee Valley Authority entered into the transaction pursuant to \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 343]\n\u00a0\n an act of Congress. The fact that the bill calls for an enquiry into the legality of the transaction does not overcome the obstacle that ordinarily stockholders have no standing to interfere with the management. Mere belief that corporate action, taken or contemplated, is illegal gives the stockholder no greater right to interfere than is possessed by any other citizen. Stockholders are not guardians of the public. The function of guarding the public against acts deemed illegal rests with the public officials.\n Within recognized limits, stockholders may invoke the judicial remedy to enjoin acts of the management which threaten their property interest. But they cannot secure the aid of a court to correct what appear to them to be mistakes of judgment on the part of the officers. Courts may not interfere with the management of the corporation, unless there is bad faith, disregard of the relative rights of its members, or other action seriously threatening their property rights. This rule applies whether the mistake is due to error of fact or of law, or merely to bad business judgment. It applies, among other things, where the mistake alleged is the refusal to assert a seemingly clear cause of action, or the compromise of it. United Copper Securities Co. v. Amalgamated Copper Co., \n244 \nU.S. 261, 263\n, 264 S., 37 S.Ct. 509. If a stockholder could compel the officers to enforce every legal right, courts, instead of chosen officers, would be the arbiters of the corporation's fate.\n In Hawes v. Oakland, \n104 U.S. 450\n, 462, a common stockholder sought to enjoin the Contra Costa Water-Works Company from permitting the city of Oakland to take without compensation water in excess of that to which it was legally entitled. This Court, in affirming dismissal of the bill, said: 'It may be the exercise of the highest wisdom, to let the City use the water in the manner complained of. The directors are better able to act \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 344]\n\u00a0\n understandingly on this subject than a stockholder residing in New York. The great body of the stockholders residing in Oakland or other places in California, may take this view of it and be content to abide by the action of their directors. If this be so, is a bitter litigation with the City to be conducted by one stockholder for the Corporation and all other stockholders, because the amount of his dividends is diminished '\n In Corbus v. Alaska Treadwell Gold Mining Co., \n187 \nU.S. 455, 463\n, 23 S.Ct. 157, 160, a suit by the common stockholder to enjoin payment of an Alaska license tax alleged to be illegal, the Court said: 'The directors represent all the stockholders, and are presumed to act honestly and according to their best judgment for the interests of all. Their judgment as to any matter lawfully confided to their discretion may not lightly be challenged by any stockholder or at his instance submitted for review to a court of equity. The directors may sometimes properly waive a legal right vested in the corporation in the belief that its best interests will be promoted by not insisting on such right. They may regard the expense of enforcing the right or the furtherance of the general business of the corporation in determining whether to waive or insist upon the right. And a court of equity may not be called upon at the appeal of any single stockholder to compel the directors or the corporation to enforce every right which it may possess, irrespective of other considerations. It is not a trifling thing for a stockholder to attempt to coerce the directors of a corporation to an act which their judgment does not approve, or to substitute his judgment for theirs.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The equity practice. Even where property rights of stockholders are alleged to be violated by the management, stockholders seeking an injunction must \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 345]\n\u00a0\n bear the burden of showing danger of irreparable injury, as do others who seek that equitable relief. In the case at bar the burden of making such proof was a peculiarly heavy one. The plaintiffs, being preferred stockholders, have but a limited interest in the enterprise, resembling, in this respect, that of a bondholder in contradistinction to that of a common stockholder. Acts may be innocuous to the preferred which conceivably might injure common stockholders. There was no finding that the property interests of the plaintiffs were imperiled by the transaction in question; and the record is barren of evidence on which any such finding could have been made.\n Third. The practice in constitutional cases. The fact that it would be convenient for the parties and the public to have promptly decided whether the legislation assailed is valid, cannot justify a departure from these settled rules of corporate law and established principles of equity practice. On the contrary, the fact that such is the nature of the enquiry proposed should deepen the reluctance of courts to entertain the stockholder's suit. 'It must be evident to any one that the power to declare a legislative enactment void is one which the judge, conscious of the fallibility of the human judgment, will shrink from exercising in any case where he can conscientiously and with due regard to duty and official oath decline the responsibility.' 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations ( 8th Ed.), p. 332.\n The Court has frequently called attention to the 'great gravity and delicacy' of its function in passing upon the validity of an act of Congress;3 and has restricted exercise of this function by rigid insistence that the jurisdiction of federal courts is limited to actual cases and controversies; and that they have no power to give advisory \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 346]\n\u00a0\n opinions. \n4\n On this ground it has in recent years ordered the dismissal of several suits challenging the constitutionality of important acts of Congress. In Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n258 \nU.S. 158, 162\n, 42 S.Ct. 261, the validity of titles 3 and 4 of the Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 456). In New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328\n, 46 S.Ct. 122, the validity of parts of the Federal Water Power Act (41 Stat. 1063). In Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423\n, 51 S.Ct. 522, the validity of the Boulder Canyon Project Act (43 U.S.C.A.  617 et seq.). Compare United States v. West Virginia, \n295 U.S. 46\n , 55 S.Ct. 789, involving the Federal Water Power Act and Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, \n273 \nU.S. 70\n, 47 S.Ct. 282, where this Court affirmed the dismissal of a suit to test the validity of a Kentucky statute concerning the sale of tobacco; also, Massachusetts State Grange v. Benton, \n272 \nU.S. 525\n, 47 S.Ct. 189.\n The Court developed, for its own governance in the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision. They are:\n\n 1. \nThe Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, nonadversary, proceeding, declining because to decide such questions 'is legitimate only in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest, and vital controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legislative act.' Chicago & Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 12 S.Ct. 400, 402. Compare Lord v. Veazie, 8 How. 251; Atherton Mills v. Johnston, \n259 \nU.S. 13, 15\n, 42 S.Ct. 422.\n\n 2. \nThe Court will not 'anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.' \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 347]\n\u00a0\n Liverpool, N.Y. & Phila. Steamship Co. v. Emigration Commissioners, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 39\n, 5 S.Ct. 352, 355;5 Abrams v. Van Schaick, \n293 \nU.S. 188\n, 55 S.Ct. 135; Wilshire Oil Co. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 100\n, 55 S.Ct. 673. 'It is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.' Burton v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 283, 295\n, 25 S. Ct. 243, 245.\n\n 3. \nThe Court will not 'formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.' Liverpool, N.Y. & Phila. Steamship Co. v. Emigration Commissioners, supra. Compare Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, Inc., \n275 U.S. 164\n, 169-172, 48 S.Ct. 66.\n\n 4. \nThe Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. This rule has found most varied application. Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter. Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175, 191\n, 29 S.Ct. 451; Light v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 523, 538\n, 31 S.Ct. 485. Appeals from the highest court of a state challenging its decision of a question under the Federal Constitution are frequently dismissed because the judgment can be sustained on an independent state ground. Berea College v. Kentucky, \n211 \nU.S. 45, 53\n, 29 S.Ct. 33.\n\n 5. \nThe Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation. \n6\n Tyler v. Judges, etc., 179 U. \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 348]\n\u00a0\n S. 405, 21 S.Ct. 206; Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 621\n, 35 S.Ct. 140. Among the many applications of this rule, none is more striking than the denial of the right of challenge to one who lacks a personal or property right. Thus, the challenge by a public official interested only in the performance of his official duty will not be entertained. Columbus & Greenville Ry. Co. v. Miller, \n283 \nU.S. 96, 99\n, 100 S., 51 S.Ct. 392. In Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126\n, 42 S.Ct. 274, the Court affirmed the dismissal of a suit brought by a citizen who sought to have the Nineteenth Amendment declared unconstitutional. In Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447\n, 43 S.Ct. 597, the challenge of the federal Maternity Act was not entertained although made by the commonwealth on behalf of all its citizens.\n\n 6. \nThe Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits. \n7\n Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Attorney General, \n124 \nU.S. 581\n, 8 S.Ct. 631; Wall v. Parrot Silver & Copper Co., \n244 \nU.S. 407, 411\n, 412 S., 37 S.Ct. 609; St. Louis Malleable Casting Co. v. Prendergast Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 469\n, 43 S.Ct. 178.\n\n 7. \n'When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.' Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 62\n, 52 S.Ct. 285, 296.8 \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 349]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. I am aware that, on several occasions, this Court passed upon important constitutional questions which were presented in stockholders' suits bearing a superficial resemblance to that now before us. But in none of those cases was the question presented under circumstances similar to those at bar. In none, were the plaintiffs preferred stockholders. In some, the Court dealt largely with questions of federal jurisdiction and collusion. In most, the propriety of considering the constitutional question was not challenged by any party. In most, the statute challenged imposed a burden upon the corporation and penalties for fail re to discharge it; whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority Act (16 U.S.C.A.  831 et seq.) imposed no obligation upon the Alabama Power Company, and under the contract it received a valuable consideration. Among other things, the Authority agreed not to sell outside the area covered by the contract, and thus preserved the corporation against possible serious competition. The effect of this agreement was equivalent to a compromise of a doubtful cause of action. Certainly, the alleged invalidity of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act was not a matter so clear as to make compromise illegitimate. These circumstances present features differentiating the case at bar from all the cases in which stockholders have been held entitled to have this Court pass upon the constitutionality of a statute which the directors had refused to challenge. The cases commonly cited are these: 9\n Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331, 341-346, was a suit brought by a common stockholder to enjoin a breach of trust by the directors which, if submitted to, would seriously injure the plaintiff. The Court crew clearly the distinction between 'an error of judgment' and a breach \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 350]\n\u00a0\n of duty; declared that it could not interfere if there was only an error of judgment; held that on the facts the threatened action of the directors would be a breach of trust; and pointed to the serious injury necessarily resulting therefrom to the plaintiff. \n 10\n\u00a0\n\n Greenwood v. Union Freight R. Co., \n105 \nU.S. 13, 15\n, 16 S., was a suit brought by a common stockholder to enjoin the enforcement of a statute alleged to be unconstitutional as repealing the corporation's charter. The Court said: 'It is sufficient to say that this bill presents so strong a case of the total destruction of the corporate existence ... that we think the complainant as a stockholder comes within the rule ... which authorizes a shareholder to maintain a suit to prevent such a disaster, where the corporation peremptorily refuses to move in the matter.'\n Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 553\n, 554 S., 15 S.Ct. 673, 679, was a suit brought by a common stockholder to enjoin a breach of trust by paying voluntarily a tax which was said to be illegal. The stockholder's substantive right to object was not challenged. The question raised was that of equity jurisdiction. The allegation of threatened irreparable damage to the corporation and \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 351]\n\u00a0\n to the plaintiff was admitted. The Court said: 'The objection of adequate remedy t law was not raised below, nor is it now raised by appellees, if it could be entertained at all at this stage of the proceedings; and, so far as it was within the power of the government to do so, the question of jurisdiction, for the purposes of the case, was explicitly waived on the argument. ... Under these circumstances, we should not be justified in declining to proceed to judgment upon the merits.' The jurisdictional issued discussed in the dissent (157 U.S. at pages 608-612, 15 S.Ct. 673) was the effect of Rev.St.  3224 (26 U.S.C.A.  1543).\n Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co., \n183 \nU.S. 79, 113\n, 22 S.Ct. 30, 44, was a suit brought by a common stockholder to enjoin enforcement of a rate statute alleged to be unconstitutional against which the directors refused to protect the corporation. It was alleged and found that its enforcement would subject the company to great and irreparable loss. The serious contention concerning jurisdiction was, as stated by Mr. Justice Brewer, whether a suit lay against the Attorney General of the State. Of the jurisdiction of the suit 'as one involving a controversy between the stockholders and the corporation and its officers, no serious question is made.'\n Chicago v. Mills, \n204 \nU.S. 321\n, 27 S.Ct. 286, was a suit brought by a common stockholder of the People's Gas, Light & Coke Company to enjoin enforcement of an ordinance alleged to be illegal. The sole question before this Court was whether the federal court had jurisdiction. That question raised an issue of fact. This Court in affirming the judgment below said (\n204 U.S. 321\n, at page 331, 27 S.Ct. 286, 289): 'Upon the whole record we agree with the circuit court that the testimony does not disclose that the jurisdiction of the Federal court was collusively and fraudulently invoked.'\n Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 10 S., 36 S.Ct. 236, L.R.A.1917D, 414, Ann.Cas.1917B, 713, was a suit brought by a common stockholder to restrain the corporation from voluntarily paying a tax alleged to \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 352]\n\u00a0\n be invalid. As stated by plaintiff's counsel: 'The contention is-and this is the only objection that is made to the suit-that it seeks to do indirectly what the Revised Statutes (section 3224) have said shall not be done; namely, enjoin the collection of a tax.' The Court, assuming that the averments were identical with those in the Pollock Case, declared that the right of the stockholder to sue was clear.\n Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 U.S. 180\n, 199-202, 41 S. Ct. 243, was a suit brought by a common stockholder to enjoin investment by the company in bonds issued under the Federal Farm Loan Act. Neither the parties, nor the government which filed briefs as amicus, made any objection to the jurisdiction. But as both parties were citizens of Missouri, the Court raised, and considered fully, the question whether there was federal jurisdiction under section 24 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.A.  41). It was on this question that Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice McReynolds dissented. The Court held that there was federal jurisdiction; and upon averments of the bill, assumed to be adequate, sustained the right of the stockholder to invoke the equitable remedy on the authority of the Brushaber and Pollock Cases.\n Hill v. Wallace, \n259 U.S. 44\n, 60-63, 42 S.Ct. 453, 455, was a suit by members of the Board of Trade of Chicago to restrain enforcement of the Future Trading Act (42 Stat. 187), alleged to be unconstitutional. The Court held that the averments of the bill, which included allegations of irreparable injury, stated 'sufficient equitable grounds to justify granting the relief' on the cases above cited.\n If, or in so far as, any of the cases discussed may be deemed authority for sustaining this bill, they should now be disapproved. This Court, while recognizing the soundness of the rule of stare decisis where appropriate, has not hesitated to overrule earlier decisio  shown, upon fuller \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 353]\n\u00a0\n consideration, to be erroneous. \n11\n Our present keener appreciation of the wisdom of limiting our decisions rigidly to questions essential to the disposition of the case before the court is evidenced by United States v. Hastings, \n296 \nU.S. 188\n, 56 S.Ct. 218, decided at this term. There, we overruled United States v. Stevenson, \n215 U.S. 190\n, 195, long a controlling authority on the Criminal Appeals Act ( 18 U.S.C.A.  682).\n Fifth. If the Company ever had a right to challenge the transaction with the Tennessee Valley Authority, its right had been lost be estoppel before this suit was begun; and as it is the company's right which plaintiffs seek to enforce, they also are necessarily estopped. The Tennessee Valley Authority Act became a law on May 18, 1933. Between that date and January, 1934, the company and its associates purchased approximately 230,000,000 kwh electric energy at Wilson Dam. Under the contract of January 4, 1934, which is here assailed, continued purchase of Wilson Dam power was provided for and made; and the Authority has acted in other matters in reliance on the contract. In May, 1934, the Company applied to the Alabama Public Service Commission for approval of the transfers provided for in the contract; and on June 1, 1934, the commission made in general terms its finding that the proposed sale of the properties was consistent with the public interest. Moreover, the plaintiffs in their own right are estopped by their long inaction. Although widespread publicity was given to the negotiations for the contract and to these later pro- \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 354]\n\u00a0\n ceedings, the plaintiffs made no protect until August 7, 1934; and did not begin this suit until more than eight months after the execution of the contract. Others-certain ice and coal companies who thought they would suffer as competitors-appeared before the commission in opposition to the action of the Authority; and apparently they are now contributing to the expenses of this litigation.\n Sixth. Even where by the substantive law stockholders have a standing to challenge the validity of legislation under which the management of a corporation is acting, courts should, in the exercise of their discretion, refuse an injunction unless the alleged invalidity is clear. This would seem to follow as a corollary of the long established presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a statute.\n Mr. Justice Iredell said, as early as 1798, in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 399: 'If any act of congress, or of the legislature of a state, violates those constitutional provisions, it is unquestionably void; though, I admit, that as the authority to declare it void is of a delicate and awful nature, the court will never resort to that authority, but in a clear and urgent case.'\n Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said, in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 625: 'On more than one occasion, this court has expressed the cautions circumspection with which it approaches the consideration of such questions; and has declared, that in no doubtful case, would it pronounce a legislative act to be contrary to the constitution.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[297 U.S. 288, 355]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Washington said, in Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 270: 'But if I could rest my opinion in favour of the constitutionality of the law on which the question arises, on no other ground than this doubt so felt and acknowledged, that alone, would, in my estimation, be a satisfactory vindication of it. It is but a decent respect due to the wisdom, the integrity and the patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favour of its validity, until its violation of the constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt. This has always been the language of this court, when that subject has called for its decision; and I know that it expresses the honest sentiments of each and every member of this bench.'\n Mr. Chief Justice Waite said in the Sinking-Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700\n, 718: 'This declaration (that an act of Congress is unconstitutional) should never be made except in a clear case. Every possible presumption is in favor of the validity of a statute, and this continues until the contrary is shown beyond a rational doubt. One branch of the government cannot encroach on the domain of another without danger. The safety of our institutions depends in no small degree on a strict observance of this salutary rule.'\n The challenge of the power of the Tennessee Valley Authority rests wholly upon the claim that the act of \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 356]\n\u00a0\n Congress which authorized the contract is unconstitutional. As the opinions of this Court and of the Circuit Court of Appeals show, that claim was not a matter 'beyond peradventure clear.' The challenge of the validity of the act is made on an application for an injunction-a proceeding in which the court is required to exercise its judicial discretion. In proceedings for a mandamus, where, also, the remedy is granted not as a matter of right but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, Duncan Townsite Co. v. Lane, \n245 \nU.S. 308, 311\n, 312 S., 38 S.Ct. 99, courts decline to enter upon the enquiry when there is a serious doubt as to the existence of the right or duty sought to be enforced. As was said in United States v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 50, 63\n, 55 S.Ct. 326, 331: 'Where the matter is not beyond peradventure clear, we have invariably refused the writ (of mandamus), even though the question were one of law as to the extent of the statutory power of an administrative officer or body.' A fortiori this rule should have been applied here where the power challenged is that of Congress under the Constitution.\n Mr. Justice STONE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n Considering the consistent rulings of this court through many years, it is not difficult for me to conclude that petitioners have presented a justiciable controversy which we must decide. In Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180\n, 41 S.Ct. 243, the grounds for jurisdiction were far less substantial than those here disclosed. We may not with propriety avoid disagreeable duties by lightly forsaking ong respected precedents and established practice.\n Nor do I find serious difficulty with the notion that the United States, by proper means and for legitimate ends, \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 357]\n\u00a0\n may dispose of water power or electricity honestly developed in connection with permissible improvement of navigable waters. But the means employed to that end must be reasonably appropriate in the circumstances. Under pretense of exercising granted power, they may not in fact undertake something not intrusted to them. Their mere ownership, e.g., of an iron mine would hardly permit the construction of smelting works followed by entry into the business of manufacturing and selling hardware, albeit the ore could thus be disposed of, private dealers discomfited and artificial prices publicized. Here, therefore, we should consider the truth of petitioners' charge that, while pretending to act within their powers to improve navigation, the United States, through corporate agencies, are really seeking to accomplish what they have no right to undertake-the business of developing, distributing and selling electric power. If the record sustains this charge, we ought so to declare and decree accordingly.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals took too narrow a view of the purpose and effect of the contract of January 4, 1934. That went far beyond the mere acquisition of transmission lines for proper use in disposing of power legitimately developed. Like all contracts, it must be considered as a whole, illumined by surrounding circumstances. Especial attention should be given to the deliberately announced purpose of directors, clothed with extraordinary discretion and supplied with enormous sums of money. With $ 50,000,000 at their command they started out to gain control of the electrical business in large areas and to dictate sale prices. The power at Wilson Dam was the instrumentality seized upon for carrying the plan into effect.\n While our primary concern is with this contract, it cannot be regarded as a mere isolated effort to dispose of property. And certainly to consider only those provisions \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 358]\n\u00a0\n which directly relate to Alabama Power Company is not permissible. We must give attention to the whole transaction-its antecedents, purpose and effect-as well as the terms employed.\n No abstract question is before us; on the contrary, the matter is of enormous practical importance to petitioners-their whole investment is at stake. Properly understood, the pronouncements, policies and program of the Authority illuminate the action taken. They help to reveal the serious interference with the petitioners' rights. Their property was in danger of complete destruction under a considered program commenced by an agency of the national government with vast resources subject to its discretion and backed by other agencies likewise intrusted with discretionary use of huge sums. The threat of competition by such an opponent was appalling. The will to prevail was evident. No private concern could reasonably hope to withstand such force.\n The Tennessee river, with headwaters in West Virginia and North Carolina, crosses Tennessee on a southwesterly course, enters Alabama near Chattanooga, and flows westerly across the northern part of that state to the northeast corner of Mississippi. There it turns northward, passes through Tennessee and Kentucky, and empties into the Ohio forty miles above Cairo. The total length is nine hundred miles; the drainage basin approximates forty thousand square miles. The volume of water is extremely variable; commercial navigation is of moderate importance.\n At Muscle Shoals, near Florence, Ala. (twenty miles east of the Mississippi line and fifteen south of Tennessee), a succession of falls constitutes serious interference with navigation; also presents possibilities for development of power on a large scale. During and immediately after the World War, a great dam was constructed there by the United States, intended primarily for genera- \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 359]\n\u00a0\n tion of power. Production o electricity soon commenced. Some of this was devoted to governmental purposes; much was sold, delivery being made at or near the dam.\n During the last thirty years, several corporations have been engaged in the growing business of developing electric energy and distributing this to customers over a network of interconnected lines extending throughout Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. At great expense they gradually built up extensive businesses and acquired properties of very large value. All operated under state supervision. Through stock ownership or otherwise, they came under general control of the Commonwealth & Southern Corporation. Among the associates were the Alabama Power Company which serviced Alabama; the Mississippi Company which serviced Mississippi; and the Tennessee Company which operated in eastern Tennessee. Huge sums were invested in these enterprises by thousands of persons in many states. Apparently, the companies were diligently developing their several systems and responding to the demands of the territories which they covered.\n In 1933, operations began under an imposing program for somewhat improving Tennessee river navigation and especially for developing the water power along its whole course at public expense. This plan involved conversion of water power into electricity for wide distribution throughout the valley and adjacent territory. Its development was intrusted to the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federal corporation wholly controlled by the United States. This promptly took over the Wilson Dam and began work upon the Wheeler Dam, twenty miles up the river, and the Pickwick Dam, some forty miles lower down. Also it commenced construction of Norris Dam across Clinch river, a branch of the Tennessee, two hundred miles above the Wilson Dam. All these, with probable additions, were to be connected by transmission wires, \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 360]\n\u00a0\n and electric energy distributed from them to millions of people in many states. Public service corporations were to be brought to terms or put out of business. At least $75,000,000 of public funds was early appropriated for expenditure by the directors; and other governmental agencies in control of vast sums were ready to lend aid.\n Readily to understand the issues now before us, one must be mindful of these circumstances.\n The trial court made findings of fact which fill more than sixty printed pages. They are not controverted and for present purposes are accepted; upon them the cause stands for decision. They are much quoted below. Plainly they indicate, and that court, in effect, declared, the contract of January 4th was a deliberate step into a forbidden field, taken with definite purpose to continue the trespass.\n Nothing suggests either necessity or desirability of entering into this agreement solely to obtain solvent customers willing to pay full value for all surplus power generated at Wilson Dam. Apparently there was ample opportunity for such sales deliveries to be made at or near the dam. No attempt was made to show otherwise. The definite end in view was something other than orderly disposition.\n The Authority's answer to the complaint is little more than a series of denials. It does not even allege that the contract of January 4th was necessary for ready disposal of power; or that thereby better prices could be obtained; or that no buyer was ready, able and willing to take at the dam for full value; or that the board expected to derive adequate return from the business to be acquired. No sort of explanation of the contract is presented-why it was entered into or whether profitable use probably could be made of the property. And I find in the Authority's brief no serious attempt to justify the purchases because necessary or in fact an advantageous method for dispos- \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 361]\n\u00a0\n ing of property. Nothing in the findings lends support to any such view.\n The record leaves no room for reasonable doubt that the primary purpose was to put the federal government into the business of distrib ting and selling electric power throughout certain large districts, to expel the power companies which had long serviced them, and to control the market therein. A government instrumentality had entered upon a pretentious scheme to provide a 'yardstick' of the fairness of rates charged by private owners, and to attain 'no less a goal than the electrification of America.' 'When we carry this program into every town and city and village, and every farm throughout the country, we will have written the greatest chapter in the economic, industrial and social development of America.' Any reasonable doubt concerning the purpose and result of the contract of January 4th or of the design of the Authority should be dispelled by examination of its Reports for 1934 and 1935.*\n * From the Annual Report, T.V.A. Board for 1934, pp. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28:\n To provide a workable and economic basis of operations, the Authority plans initially to serve certain definite regions and to develop its program in those areas before going outside.\n The initial areas selected by the Authority may be roughly described as (a) the region immediately proximate to the route of the transmission line soon to be constructed by the Authority between Muscle Shoals and the site of Norris Dam; (b) the region in proximity to Muscle Shoals, including northern Alabama and northeastern Mississippi; and (c) the region in the proximity of Norris Dam (the new source of power to be constructed by the Authority on the Clinch River in northeast Tennessee).\n At a later stage in the development it is contemplated to include, roughly, the drainage area of the Tennessee River in Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina, and that part of Tennessee which lies east of the west margin of the Tennessee drainage area.\n To make the area a workable one and a fair measure of public ownership, it should include several cities of substantial size (such as Chattanooga and Knoxville) and, ultimately, at least one city of more \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 362]\n\u00a0\n 'The conception was to establish an independent network comparable in all respects with the electric utility system serving the area, with which TVA sought to establish interchange arrangements, both as outlets for its \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 363]\n\u00a0\n own power, and to use existing systems as a stand-by or back-up service.'\n'The TVA plan as conceived and in process of execution contemplates complete and exclusive control and jurisdiction over all power sites on the Tennessee River \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 364]\n\u00a0\n and tributaries.' 'The TVA policy contemplates full corporate discretion by TVA in developing, executing and extending its electric system and service within transmission limits.' 'This policy contemplated service utility in type and covered not only generation but transmission and distribution (preferably through public or nonprofit agencies, if available) both wholesale and retail. That is,\n\n___ Relief labor was withdrawn of February 15, 1934, after which date the work was continued by the Authority with its own forces. Approximately 93.5 miles of rural electric lines were under construction in Lauderdale and Colbert Counties, Ala., on June 30, and approximately 127 miles in Lee, Pontotoc, Alcorn, Itawamba, Prentiss, Monroe, and Tishomingo Counties, Miss.\n A standard form of 20-year contract was devised to govern the sale of power at wholesale to municipal distribution systems, and was first used in a contract with the city of Tupelo, Miss. The Tupelo contract has been published by the Authority and is available for distribution.\n Annual Report, T.V.A. 1935, pp. 29, 30:\n The Authority has devoted special attention during the year to the problems of rural electrification, as required by section 10 of the act. By the close of the fiscal year 200 miles of rural electric line had been built, and 181 additional miles were in process of construction. These lines are divided among the various counties as follows:\n Miles Miles in completed progress Alabama: Colbert 19 15 Lauderdale 72 --- Mississippi: Alcorn 41 29 Lee and Itawamba 41 26 Pontotac 27 --- Prentiss 7 Tennessee: Lincoln --- 104\n Total 200 181\n In addition to the above, a number of the rural lines purchased from the Mississippi Power Co. were rehabilitated in ord r to improve operating and safety conditions, and to provide for increases in load. Also, additional customers were connected to all existing rural lines. \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 365]\n\u00a0\n moreover, implicit in both the January 4 contract and the now terminated August 9th contract.'\n The challenged contract is defended upon the theory that the 'Federal Government may dispose of the surplus water power necessarily created by Wilson Dam and may authorize generation of electric energy and acquisition of transmission lines as means of facilitating this disposal.' But to facilitate disposal was not the real purpose; obviously the thing to be facilitated was carrying on business by use of the purchased property. Under the guise of disposition something wholly different was to be accomplished-devotion of electric power to purposes beyond the sphere of proper federal action, an unlawful goal. There is no plausible claim that such a contract was either necessary or desirable merely to bring about the sale of property. This Court has often affirmed that facts, not artifice, control its conclusions. The Agency has stated quite clearly the end in view: 'This public operation is to serve as a yardstick by which to measure the fairness of electric rates.' 'The TVA power policy was not designed or limited with a view to the marketing of the power produced and available at Muscle Shoals.' 'In formulating and going forward with the power policy the Board was considering that policy as a permanent and independent commercial function.'\n For present purposes a complete survey of relevant circumstances preceding the contract of January 4th and all its consequences is not essential. The pleadings and findings fairly outline the situation. What follows is mainly quoted or derived from them.\n The Act of May 18, 1933, created the Tennessee Valley Authority as a body corporate 'for the purpose of maintaining and operating the properties now owned by the United States in the vicinity of Muscle Shoals, Alabama, in the interest of the national defense and for agricultural \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 366]\n\u00a0\n and industrial development, and to improve navigation in the Tennessee River and to control the destructive flood waters in the Tennessee River and Mississippi River Basins.' Section 1, 16 U.S.C.A.  831. It provided, a board of three directors 'shall direct the exercise of all the powers of the Corporation' (section 2, 16 U.S.C.A.  831a), and 'is authorized to make alterations, modifications, or improvements in existing plants and facilities, and to construct new plants' (section 5, 16 U.S.C.A.  831d); and to 'produce, distribute, and sell electric power, as herein particularly specified.' (Section 5). The corporation 'shall have such powers as may be necessary or appropriate for the exercise of the powers herein specifically conferred upon the Corporation' (section 4, 16 U.S.C.A .  831c); 'to acquire real estate for the construction of dams, reservoirs, transmission lines, power houses, and other structures, and navigation projects at any point along the Tennessee River, or any of its tributaries.' (Section 4).\n Also, the board is 'hereby empowered and authorized to sell the surplus power not used in its operations, and for operation of locks and other works generated by it, to States, counties, municipalities, corporations, partnerships, or individuals, according to the policies hereinafter set-forth; and to carry out said authority, the board is authorized to enter into contracts for such sale for a term not exceeding twenty years.' Section 10, 16 U.S.C.A.  831i. 'In order to promote and encourage the fullest possible use of electric light and power on farms within reasonable distance of any of its transmission lines the board in its discretion shall have power to construct transmission lines to farms and small villages that are not otherwise supplied with electricity at reasonable rates, and to make such rules and regulations governing such sale and distribution of such electric power as in its judgment may be just and equitable.' Section 10.\n'One of the first corporate acts of TVA after its organization was to formulate and announce a power policy to govern the commercial distribution of electric power by TVA. The evidence establishes the fact that the Board \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 367]\n\u00a0\n from the outset has considered that it has general corporate discretion as to the establishment and extension of its electric power policy. In establishing a power policy the Board was not primarily considering merely the question of disposal of power produced at Muscle Shoals no longer required for governmental purposes as a result of overbuilding, obsolescence of plants or termination of war purpose. Nor was it considering disposal of prospective increases in electric power to be unavoidably created in excess of some governmental requirement. It was considering the matter from the standpoint of the successful establishment and permanent operation of an independent and well rounded government- owned electric distribution system and the general civic, social and industrial planning and development of the Tennessee Valley region as a whole.'\n\n'Under date of August 25, 1933, TVA announced its power policy, indicating both the initial stage of its development and certain later steps originally determined upon. ... This power policy had not been rescinded or abandoned or modified at the time of submission of this cause.'\n\n'In September, 1933, the Authority announced its wholesale and retail rate schedules, which are shown by the evidence to be materially lower than corresponding schedules of the existing utilities in the area. Following this action numerous municipalities in the area began to make efforts to construct municipal systems with which to distribute TVA current, and Public Works Administration (called PWA) gave assurances of favorable consideration of applications for loans to that end.'\n\n Under such circumstances, Commonwealth & Southern Corporation negotiated the January 4th contract for its operating subsidiaries-Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, and Tennessee Electric Power Company. \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 368]\n\u00a0\n This recited that the Alabama Company, the Mississippi Company, and the Tennessee Company desired to sell, and the Authority desired to purchase, certain land, buildings, and physical properties devoted to the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, together with certain franchises, contracts, and going business.\n The Alabama Company agreed to sell for $1,000,000 all of its low tension (44 KV or lower) transmission lines, substations (including the high tension station at Decatur and the Sheffield Steam Plant Station), and all rural lines and rural distribution systems in five Alabama counties and parts of two others. (These counties are northwestern Alabama and lie on both sides of the Tennessee river for eighty miles or more.)\n The Mississippi Company, in consideration of $850,000, agreed to transfer all of its transmission and distribution lines, substations, generating plants and other property in Pontoto , Lee, Itawamba, Union, Benton, Tippah, Prentiss, Tishomingo, and Alcorn counties (except one dam site in Tishomingo county), state of Mississippi, used in connection with the generation, transmission, distribution or sale of electrical energy. ( These counties are the northeastern section of the state, a territory sixty miles square.)\n For $900,000, the Tennessee Company agreed to convey its transmission and distribution lines, substations, distribution systems, and other properties used in connection with the transmission, distribution, and sale of electrical energy in Anderson, Campbell, Morgan, and Scott counties, East Tennessee, and 'all of the 66 KV transmission line from Cove Creek to Knoxville.' (These counties are in the mountains northward from Knoxville within a radius of about sixty miles. They lie northeast of Muscle Shoals and some points therein are much more than a hundred miles from Wilson Dam. They have a population of 86,000.) \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 369]\n\u00a0\n The power companies agreed that 'any conveyance of property shall include not only the physical property, easements and rights-of-way, but shall also include all machinery, equipment, tools and working supplies set forth in the respective exhibits, and all franchises, contracts and going business relating to the use of any of said properties.' Also, 'to transfer or secure the transfer of said franchises, contracts and going business, and to transfer said properties with all present customers attached, so far as they are able.' Also, 'that during the period of this contract none of said companies will sell electric energy to any municipality, corporation, partnership, association or individual in any portion of the above described counties or parts thereof in Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi, etc.' The Authority agreed not to sell 'electric energy outside of the specified counties to the customers of non- utilities supplied by the power companies.'\n Other covenants provided for interchange of electric energy between the contracting parties and for cooperation in the sale of electric appliances throughout the entire territory served by the power companies.\n'Power Companies covenant and agree that after the expiration of this agreement the interchange arrangement then in effect will be maintained by Power Companies for an additional period (not exceeding eighteen months) sufficient to permit Authority to construct its own transmission facilities for serving all of the territory which it is then serving in whole or in part with power obtained at such interchange points.'\n\n'Power Companies agree to have available at all times for exchange, at each point of exchange, energy and capacity to supply the entire demands of the customers served by Authority from such points of exchange, subject to the limitations as to transmission capacity set forth in Section 10(h) hereof; Provided, that the maxi- \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 370]\n\u00a0\n mum amount which Authority shall be entitled to demand at all points of exchange shall be 70,000 k.v.'\n\n Prior to the agreement for sale the Alabama Company had derived $750, 000 gross annual revenue from its properties located within the 'ceded area.' This district had a population of 190,000; and the company had therein 10,000 individual customers-approximately one-tenth of all those directly served by it. The lines transferred by the Mississippi Power Company served directly 4,000 customers in 9 counties, having total population of 184,000. When this cause began, the Mississippi properties were being operated by TVA and rural lines were in process of extension by it in both Mississippi and Alabama.\n'All of the electric properties and facilities covered by the contract of January 4, 1934, ... were contracted for by TVA for the purpose of continuing and enlarging the utility service for which they were used by the respective power companies.'\n\n'The operation of a commercial utility service by TVA and the wholesaling and retailing by TVA of electricity in the area served by the Alabama Power Company is not and will not be in aid of the regulation of navigation or national defense or other governmental function in so far as any plan, purpose or activity of the TVA or the United States disclosed on this record would indicate.'\n\n Answering the petitioners' complaint, Alabama Company admitted 'that the public statements of TVA indicated the program therein alleged; and the directors of respondent company considered that to vest such an agency as therein alleged with unlimited power and access to public funds, in a program of business competition and public ownership promotion in the area served by respondent company would in effect destroy this respondent's property; and such conclusion on its part was the \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 371]\n\u00a0\n principal inducement for it to enter into the contracts of January 4 and August 9, 1934; and respondent company thereby was and will be enabled to salvage a larger amount of its property than it could have done by competition.' Also, 'that under the circumstances of threatened competition, directed or controlled by TVA as averred therein, this respondent agreed to the sale of certain of its transmission lines and property, and entered into the contract dated January 4, 1934. ... Respondent company admits that at and before the execution of the contract, the threat was made to use federal funds to duplicate the facilities of respondent which would result in competition with rates not attainable by or permissible to this respondent, and such rates would be stipulated, controlled and regulated by TVA.'\n As matter of law the trial court found:\n'The function intended by TVA under the evidence in relation to service, utility in type, in the area ceded by the contract of January 4, 1934, transcends the function of conservation or disposition of government property, involves continuing service and commercial functions by the government to fill contracts not governmental in origin or character.'\n\n'Performance of the contract of January 4, 1934, would involve substantial loss and injury to the Alabama Power Company, including, inter alia, the loss or abandonment of franchises, licenses, going business and service area supporting its general system and power facilities and unless resisted would tend to invite a progressive encroachment on its service area by the Tennessee Valley Authority.'\n\n'Congress has no constitutional authority to authorize Tennessee Valley Authority or any other federal agency to undertake the operation, essentially permanent in character, of a utility system, for profit, involving the \n\n[297 U.S. 288, 372]\n\u00a0\n generation, transmission and commercial distribution of electricity within state domain, having no reasonable relation to a lawful governmental use.'\n\n'The contract of January 4, 1934, expressly provided for the transfer of all or substantially all of the lines and properties of the Alabama Power Company for the service of the ceded area, included transmission lines, rural distribution systems and certain urban distribution systems, and contemplated the eventual transfer of fourteen urban distribution systems. This contract, expressly contemplating service of the ceded area by the Tennessee Valley Authority with electricity to be generated or purchased by the Tennessee Valley Authority for that purpose, was in furtherance of illegal proprietary operations by the Tennessee Valley Authority in violation of the Federal Constitution and void. The contract was accordingly ultra vires and void as to the Alabama Power Company.'\n\n Having made exhaustive findings of fact and law, the trial court entered a decree annulling the January 4th contract and enjoining the Alabama Power Company from performing it. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, upon the theory that the Authority was making proper arrangements for sale of surplus power from the Wilson dam. The injunction was continued.\n I think the trial court reached the correct conclusion and that its decree should be approved. If under the thin mask of disposing of property the United States can enter the business of generating, ransmitting and selling power as, when, and wherever some board may specify, with the definite design to accomplish ends wholly beyond the sphere marked out for them by the Constitution, and easy way has been found for breaking down the limitations heretofore supposed to guarantee protection against aggression. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Tennessee Valley Authority is a body corporate created by the Act of Congress of May 18, 1933, amended by the Act of Congress of August 31, 1935. 48 Stat. 58; 49 Stat. 1075 (16 U.S.C.A.  831 et seq.). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Commonwealth & Southern Corporation, organized under the laws of Delaware, and the owner of the common stock of the Alabama Power Company, was a party to the contract, which also contained agreements with other subsidiaries of the Commonwealth & Southern Corporation, viz: Tennessee Electric Power Company, Georgia Power Company, and Mississippi Power Company.

The Muscle Shoals plants, including the Sheffield steam plant and the 8 hydro-electric units installed at Wilson Dam, were authorized for war purposes by section 124 of the National Defense Act of 1916 in anticipation of participation in the great war. The original conception was for the use of Nitrate Plant No. 1 employing the Haber process and Plant No. 2 employing the cyanamid process for the fixation or manufacture of nitrogen and its subsequent conversion into ammonium nitrate for explosives. Plant No. 1 was completed but was never practicable, due to the lack of knowledge of the Haber process. Plant No. 2 successfully developed calcium cyanamid from a manufacturing standpoint but due to the availability of ammonium nitrate as a result of commercial development of by-product or synthetic processes, the commercial or peace-time manufacture of calcium cyanamid at Nitrate Plant No. 2 is considered uneconomical and undesirable and is not proposed or suggested by either the War Department or the TVA. The Court further finds, however, that the plant with the aid of electric power furnished by Wilson Dam and the Sheffield steam plant can be operated to produce annually 110,000 tons of ammonium nitrate by the cyanamid process and that the present plans of the War Department count upon that plant to supply that amount annually in the event of a major war. ...\n\n'40. The existence of these facilities which make available large quantities of nitrogenous war materials by use of either the nitrogen fixing process or the oxidation of synthetic ammonia is a valuable national defense asset.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Sen.Doc.No.1, 18th Cong., 2d Sess.; H.R.Doc.No.119, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 11, 12. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] See Rivers and Harbors Acts of August 30, 1852, c. 104, 10 Stat. 56, 60; July 25, 1868, c. 233, 15 Stat. 171, 174; March 3, 1871, c. 118, 16 Stat. 538, 542; June 10, 1872, c. 416, 17 Stat. 370, 372; September 19, 1890, c. 907, 26 Stat. 426, 445, 446; August 18, 1894, c. 299, 28 Stat. 338, 354; April 26, 1904, c. 1605, 33 Stat. 309; March 2, 1907; c. 2509, 34 Stat. 1073, 1093; June 25, 1910, c. 382, 36 Stat. 630, 652; July 25, 1912, c. 253, 37 Stat. 201, 215; July 27, 1916, c. 260, 39 Stat. 391, 399; March 3, 1925, c. 467, 43 Stat. 1186, 1188; July 3, 1930, c. 847, 46 Stat. 918, 927, 928.

James B. Thayer, after quoting the passage in The Origin and Scope of the American Doctrine of Constitutional Law, 7 Harv.Law Review 129, 140, called attention (p. 144) to 'a remark of Judge Cooley, to the effect that one who is a member of a legislature may vote against a measure as being, in his judgment, unconstitutional; and, being subsequently placed on the bench, when this measure having been passed by the legislature in spite of his opposition, comes before him judicially, may there find it his duty, although he has in no degree changed his opinion, to declare it constitutional.' \n than a quarter million, within transmission distance, such as Birmingham, Memphis, Atlanta, or Louisville.\n While it is the Authority's present intention to develop its power program in the above-described territory before considering going outside, the Authority may go outside the area if there are substantial changes in general conditions, facts, or governmental policy, which would necessarily require a change in this policy of regional development, or if the privately owned utilities in the area do not cooperate in the working out of the program.\n The Authority entered into a 5-year contract on January 4, 1934, with the Commonwealth & Southern Corporation and its Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, and Mississippi subsidiaries. The contract covered options to purchase electric properties in certain counties of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee, the sale of distribution systems to municipalities in these counties, restrictions on territorial expansion by the contracting parties, the interchange of power, and other matters.\n Alabama properties.-All of the low-tension (44,000 volts or lower) transmission lines, substations, rural lines, and rural distribution systems of the Alabama Power Co. in the counties of Lauderdale, Colbert, Lawrence, Limestone, and Morgan (except the Hulaco area), were included in the contract; also those in the north half of Franklin County, including the town of Red Bay, and the territory in the northern part of Cullman County served by a line of the Alabama Power Co. extending south from Decatur. The price of these properties was set at $1,101,256. The purchase had not been completed at the end of the fiscal year.\n The power company agreed to attempt to sell the local distribution systems in the above counties to the respective municipalities, the Authority reserving the right to serve them if sales were not consummated within 3 months of bona fide negotiation and effort. Because of the failure of any (many) of the municipalities in northern Alabama to consummate negotiations for the purchase of the distributi n systems serving them, the Authority entered into negotiations for the direct purchase of these distribution systems, but a purchase contract had not been completed on June 30.\n Mississippi properties.-The contract covered all of the properties of the Mississippi Power Co. in the counties of Pontotoc, Lee, Ita- \n wamba, Union, Benton, Tippah, Prentiss, Tishomingo, and Alcorn, except a dam site on the Tennessee River in Tishomingo County. The purchase price was $850,000. The purchase was completed and delivery was accepted on June 1, 1934.\n The transmission and generation facilities acquired in Mississippi and to be retained as part of the Authority's system include the following:\n 44,000-volt transmission lines miles 63 44,000-volt substations 6 22,000-volt transmission lines miles 45 22,000-volt substations 4 Tupelo steam stand-by generating plant Kilovolt-amperes 4,374 Corinth steam stand-by generating plant Kilovolt-amperes 2,225 Blue Mountain Diesel generating plant Kilovolt-amperes 150 Myrtle Diesel generating plant Kilovolt-amperes 75\n Part of the local distribution facilities acquired in Mississippi were sold prior to the end of the fiscal year and it is expected that all will be sold eventually, as noted hereafter.\n Tennessee properties.-The contract covered all of the properties of the Tennessee Electric Power Co. in the counties of Anderson, Campbell, Morgan (except the lines extending into Morgan County from Harriman), and Scott; also those in the west portion of Claiborne County, and the 66,000- volt transmission line from Anderson County to Knoxville. The price of these properties was set at $900,000. The purchase had not been completed at the end of the fiscal year.\n Negotiations were carried on diligently for several months with the National Power & Light Co., an affiliate of the Electric Bond & Share Co., in an endeavor to acquire the eastern Tennessee electric properties of the Tennessee Public Service Co., a subsidiary of the National Power & Light Co. The electric distribution system in the city of Knoxville is included in these properties. The negotiations resulted in a contract after the end of the fiscal year.\n Construction of rural electric lines in northern Alabama and northeastern Mississippi was commenced in the latter part of 1933 with relief labor, the Authority furnishing supervision and materials. \n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nASIATIC PETROLEUM CO. v. INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS(1936)\nNo. 674\nArgued: March 13, 1936Decided: March 30, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 666, 667]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. D. Whitney, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. L. S. Tillotson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner seeks review of a decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands which construed section 21 of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909.1 The reasons assigned are the importance of the question involved and conflict with a decision of the Court of Claims under a statute of similar import. The respondent urges that this Court is without jurisdiction to issue the writ, and if it has jurisdiction, should affirm the judgment.\n The section in question provides: 'Sec. 21. That on all fuel imported into the Philippine Islands which is afterwards used for the propulsion of vessels engaged in trade with foreign countries, or between ports of the United States and the Philippine Islands, or in the Philippine coastwise trade, a re- \n\n[297 U.S. 666, 668]\n\u00a0\n fund shall be allowed equal to the duty imposed by law upon such fuel, less one per centum thereof, which shall be paid under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the insular collector of customs.'\n During the period between June 15, 1932, and April 15, 1933, the petitioner imported into the Philippine Islands fuel oil, paid the prescribed duties thereon, and, in turn, made sales to agents of foreign shipping concerns with the agreement that drawbacks of customs duties paid on the quantities so sold were to be for petitioner's account. The oil was put aboard vessels of British, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, and Norwegian registry and used for their propulsion while engaged in trade between the Islands and foreign countries. The petitioner filed with the respondent certificates of the sales; the Surveyor of the Port of Manila superintended the transfer to each vessel and, in his return to the respondent, certified the correct weight of each lading. The petitioner then presented drawback entries and requested a refund of duties paid, as provided by section 21 of the Tariff Act. The respondent refused to authorize or pay the drawbacks on the ground that they are allowable only in respect of fuel imported and sold for use by vessels of Philippine registry. The petitioner applied to the Court of First Instance of Manila for a mandamus requiring the respondent to sign and issue the necessary warrants for refund of tax. The court denied the writ. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court held that the section applied only to fuel used by vessels of American or Philippine registry and affirmed the judgment.\n First. This court has jurisdiction. The relevant statute is that of February 3, 1925:2 'That in any case in the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands wherein the Constitution, or any statute or \n\n[297 U.S. 666, 669]\n\u00a0\n treaty of the United States is involved, or wherein the value in controversy exceeds $25,000, or wherein the title or possession of real estate exceeding in value the sum of $25,000 is involved or brought in question, it shall be competent for the Supreme Court of the United States, upon the petition of a party aggrieved by the final judgment or decree, to require, by certiorari, that the cause be certified to it for review and determination.'\n The provision is continued in force by the Philippine Independence Act. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n It is incontestable that the Tariff Act of 1909 as enacted by Congress was a statute of the United States within the meaning of the Act of 1925 and that this court would have jurisdiction to review a decision involving its application,4 were it not for certain provisions of the Act of 1916 for the government of the Islands. \n5\n The claim is that these repealed the Tariff Act as a law of the United States, converted it into a law of the Philippine Islands, and thus abolished our jurisdiction to review the judgment in question. The argument is grounded upon sections 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 of the organic act (48 U.S.C.A.  1003-1005, 1041, 1042) which are copied in the margin. \n6\n Respondent points out that the \n\n[297 U.S. 666, 670]\n\u00a0\n effect of these sections is to give the Philippine Legislature concurrent power with Congress to amend, alter, or repeal laws of the United States effective in the Islands, including tariff laws, with the one exception that in such tariff laws trade relations between the Islands and the United States are to continue to be governed exclusively by congressional legislation. Since 1916 the Tariff Act of 1909 has been repeatedly amended by the local legislature with the approval of the President of the United States, and the contention is that although section 21 has never been amended or repealed, the Act of 1916 and the action taken by the Philippine Legislature thereunder have converted the Tariff Act into a local law and stripped it of its character as an act of Congress. We do not agree. Section 21 derives force from the legislative action of Congress. Neither the provisions of the organic act nor the amendment of other sections by the Philippine Legislature changed the source of its authority. The erection \n\n[297 U.S. 666, 671]\n\u00a0\n of a local legislature in a territory or a possession and the grant of legislative power do not deprive Congress of the reserved power to legislate for the territory or possession, or abrogate existing congressional legislation in force therein. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n It is argued that section 15 of the Independence Act8 has repealed the Act of 1909. This section is, in part: 'Except as otherwise provided in this Act (sections 1231 to 1247 of this title), all laws or parts of laws relating to the present government of the Philippine Islands and its administration are hereby repealed as of the date of the inauguration of the government of the Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands.'\n The respondent contends that tariff acts belong to the administration of government and are within the scope of the repeal. But we think that when the phraseology of the Independence Act is viewed in its setting and is compared with section 2 of article 15 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands, continuing all laws of the Islands in force until the inauguration of the commonwealth and thereafter until amended, altered, modified, or repealed by the National Assembly, it becomes evident that laws relating to such subjects as the tariff were not repealed but only those dealing with administrative agencies and their procedure which would be inconsistent with the new frame of government. In any event the Independence Act cannot operate retroactively to deprive the petitioner of rights vested before its adoption.\n Second. The petitioner must prevail upon the merits. The court below limited the scope of the drawback provision by inserting, in effect, after the word 'vessels,' as it appears in section 21, the words 'of Philippine or American registry.' The statute is plain upon its face. The phrase used is 'vessels engaged in trade with foreign \n\n[297 U.S. 666, 672]\n\u00a0\n countries.' The court restricted the scope of the expression upon the view that the drawback was authorized in the interest of the merchant marine of the Islands and that of the United States. We are not referred to any facts to support this conclusion. An equally plausible inference is that the purpose of the provision was to afford Philippine merchants trade opportunities equal to those of foreign merchants in supplying fuel oil to ships. We are not at liberty to limit the application of so clear and unambiguous a statutory direction in the absence of convincing evidence that the intent of Congress was less sweeping than its words import. We hold that the section applies to fuel sold to all vessels, of whatever registry, trading with foreign countries. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 36 Stat. 130, 176. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Chapter 229,  7, 43 Stat. 936, 940 (28 U.S.C.A.  349). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] March 24, 1934,  7(6), c. 84, 48 Stat. 456, 462, U.S.C. tit. 48,  1237 (48 U.S.C.A.  1237(6).

McKay, of Boston, Mass., for appellant.\n Mr. James J. Ronan, of Salem, Mass., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A Massachusetts statute (Gen.Laws (Ter.Ed.) c. 63,  39-43) imposes upon a foreign corporation, with respect to the carrying on or doing of business by it within the commonwealth, an excise in a sum to be ascertained as the statute provides. So far as the present case is concerned, the amount of the excise is a specified percentage of the value of the corporate excess employed by the corporation within the commonwealth. Such corporate excess (section 30, par. 4) means, in the case of a foreign corporation, such proportion of the fair value of its capital stock as the value of the assets employed in the commonwealth bears to the value of its total assets, less certain deductions. Under this statute appellant's tax was fixed at approximately $1,500. We find nothing in the record to justify the conclusion that the amount of the tax was not fairly arrived at under the provisions of the statute as construed by the court below, or that it was so allocated as to result in imposing a tax upon property outside the state; and the only question is whether the tax constitutes an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce. The court below, sustaining the action of the state board of tax appeals, held that the exaction was an excise for the privilege of having a place for the transaction of intrastate business in the state with the protection of state law and the appertaining advantages; \n\n[298 U.S. 553, 555]\n\u00a0\n and that the effect upon interstate commerce was at most incidental and remote. (Mass.) 197 N.E. 525.\n Appellant is a corporation engaged in the wholesale lumber business, and is organized under the laws of Delaware. Its principal office is in Massachusetts, where it also maintains a sales office. Its Massachusetts office is used as headquarters for salesmen, who solicit orders in Massachusetts and other states. In that office it carries on correspondence and other business activities in connection with orders for and shipments of goods for the designated territory Orders are accepted at the Massachusetts office, and are filled from the distributing yard of the company or the mill of a subsidiary outside the state. Remittances from its customers are made to the Massachusetts office. No stocks of lumber are kept in that state; and the only tangible property in the state is office furniture and equipment and salesmen's automobiles. Appellant has bank accounts in Boston, New York City, Buffalo, Brooklyn, and Toronto, Canada; the Boston account being the most active. The corporate books and records are kept in Massachusetts, where its treasurer is located, its directors' meetings are held, and dividends are declared. Dividends, so far as declared, have been paid out of the Boston account.\n Appellant owns practically all the stock of three subsidiaries. Two of them are engaged in cutting timber and manufacturing lumber-one in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana, and the other in South Carolina. The third subsidiary simply holds title to timber lands in Louisiana.\n If appellant did nothing but transact interstate business, the tax would constitute a burden upon that commerce, and could not stand under the commerce clause of the Constitution.

Although organized in Delaware, so far as the record shows appellant does not function there but in Massachusetts, to which state the exercise of its corporate powers was transferred and is confined. In the Champion Copper Company Case, decided by this court in Cheney Brothers Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, \n246 U.S. 147\n, at page 155, 38 S.Ct. 95, 297, a Michigan corporation maintained an office in Boston, pursuant to a provision in its articles of association. The proceeds of its business in Michigan were deposited in Boston banks, which, after paying salaries and expenses, were distributed as dividends from the Boston office. Directors' meetings were held frequently during each year at the Boston office, at which meetings reports from the treasurer and general manager were received, dividends were voted, officers were elected, and other corporate duties were discharged. This court held: 'These corporate activities in Massachusetts are not interstate commerce and may be made the basis of an excise tax by that state.'\n The same decision involved a similar tax imposed upon another Michigan corporation, the Copper Range Company. That company also maintained an office in Boston. It was, like the appellant here, a holding company. In Massachusetts it held stockholders' and directors' meetings, kept corporate records and books of account, received dividends from its stock holdings, deposited the money in Boston banks, and paid the same out, after deducting salaries and expenses, in dividends to its stockholders. We held: 'The exaction of a tax for the exercise of such corporate faculties is within the power of the state. Interstate commerce is not affected.'\n The decision in respect of those companies covers the present case; and since that decision has never been overruled or qualified, it would be unnecessary to go further, except for Ozark Pipe Line v. Monier, supra, upon which appellant confidently leans. The situation there, \n\n[298 U.S. 553, 557]\n\u00a0\n however, was quite different from that presented in the present case or in the cases of the two Michigan corporations just mentioned-a difference plainly recognized by the opinion in the Ozark Case. There, a Maryland corporation owned and operated a pipe line extending from Oklahoma through Missouri to Illinois, by which crude petroleum was carried from Oklahoma to Illinois. No oil was received or delivered in Missouri. The license issued by the state was to engage 'exclusively in the business of transporting crude petroleum by pipe line.' The company, it is true, maintained its principal office in Missouri and there kept its books and bank accounts, paid its employees, purchased supplies, employed labor, maintained telephone and telegraph lines, and carried on various other activities; but all were linked exclusively to the pipe line and operated only to further the flow of oil in interstate commerce. Neither property nor activities were anything more than aids to the operation of the pipe line; and together with that line they combined to constitute in practical effect an instrumentality of that commerce. Thus, the burden of the tax which the state imposed fell upon interstate transportation immediately and directly, while here the effect upon interstate commerce, so far as there is any, is remote and incidental-a distinction which, in respect of such legislation as we are now considering, marks the line between a tax which is valid and one which is not.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE & O.R.

The case was tried by three judges. In addition to the evidence given before the Commission there were offered and received at the trial the testimony of many witnesses and much documentary evidence. The court held plaintiffs not entitled to relief dismissed the case. \n8\n They appealed. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The history and structure of the joint rates shed light on questions to be decided. June 25, 1908, the Commission found the rates, called 'gathering rates,' from places of shipment in Florida to junctions in the northern part of that state reasonable, but that the charges for transportation from the junctions to the north were unreason-\n 6 The Boston & Maine Railroad; the New York Central Railroad Company; Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Company; the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company; the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey; Reading Company; Lehigh Valley Railroad Company; the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western ,Railroad Company; the Delaware & Hudson Railroad Corporation; Erie Railroad Company; Pere Marquette Railway Company; Charles M.

It prescribed 'proportionals' which were added to the gathering rates to make joint rates applicable over through routes to destinations. Included in the proportionals were stated amounts, called 'specifics,' per box of estimated weight of 80 pounds to cover hauls beyond the gateways. These specifics went to the northern l nes and constituted their share of the joint rates. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n In 1915 the Commission allowed the carriers in official territory a general rate increase of 5 per cent. \n11\n and in 1917 granted an additional 15 per cent. \n12\n These increases were applicable generally to interterritorial hauls. The specifics for northern lines were not advanced. In 1918, while the carriers were under federal control, the director general raised rates 25 per cent. The divisions to the southern and northern lines were increased by that ratio. In 1920, after the railroads were returned to their owners, the Commission grnated to carriers in the southern group a general rate increase of 25 per cent. and to those in the eastern group, which included the northern lines here involved, an advance of 40 per cent. It also authorized charges for interterritorial hauls to be raised by 33 1\/3 per cent. \n13\n While that was enough to increase the southern carriers' shares by 25 per cent. and those of the northern lines by 40 per cent. in harmony with the respective rate increases, each group of carriers received divisions raised by 33 1\/3 per cent. The northern lines emphasize the fact that if their divisions had kept step with rates in that territory they would have been increased four times whereas in fact their divisions did not share at all in either of the first two advances and only partially in the fourth, i.e., 33 1\/3 instead of 40 per cent. \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 355]\n\u00a0\n The joint rates prescribed by the Commission's order of July 10, 1928, were specified amounts per 100 pounds. The assumed weight of 80 pounds per box to which were applied the specifics to cover hauls of the northern carriers was too low. While the Commission failed definitely to find actual average weight per box, its report distinctly indicates that it was about 90 pounds. \n14\n After the taking effect of the new rates the northern lines in trunk line and New England territories took, out of the freight charges they collected, and retained as their divisions per 100 pounds 25 per cent. more than the specific per box. The northern lines in central territory adopted 90 pounds as the basis on which to make conversion of the rate per box to rate per 100 pounds. The increase was slightly over 11. 1 per cent.\n The divisions were not satisfactory to either group of carriers. November 22, 1930, the Atlantic Coast Line and other southern carriers filed their complaint15 requesting the Commission to condemn the divisions of citrus fruit rates to trunk line and New England territories, then being received by them, as a violation of the requirements of section 1(4), of the act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1(4) to prescribe just, reasonable, and equitable divisions in accordance with section 15(6), 49 U.S.C.A.  15(6), and to require adjustment and refund to be made by northern lines in respect of transportation subsequent to the complaint. January 3, 1931, the Commission instituted a general investigation16 in respect of divisions of joint interterritorial rates between official and southern territory. April 20, 1931, the northern lines filed a cross-complaint. To prevent duplication, the general investigation, so far as it concerned divisions of rates on citrus fruit in central territory, was set for hearing on the same record as the complaint of the southern lines in respect \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 356]\n\u00a0\n of divisions of rates to trunk line and New England territory. \n17\n Thus the issue concerning divisions of citrus fruit rates from Florida to destinations in official territory was segregated from the broader controversy. The order here assailed assigns to appellants divisions yielding more than did those accepted by them for a lo g time prior to the taking effect of the rate order of July 10, 1928\n\n\n There was before the Commission no question as to the validity of the joint rates. There was no claim that they were not sufficient to cover 'out-of-pocket costs,' i.e., the amount by which performance of the service covered by the rates caused operating expenses and taxes to be higher than otherwise they would have been. Nor was it suggested that they were confiscatory, i.e., not sufficient to cover operating expenses and taxes justly apportionable to the traffic plus an amount reasonably sufficient in the circumstances to constitute just compensation for the use of the carriers' property in that service. The division of presumably reasonable rates was the only problem before the Commission. Neither complaint alleged that existing divisions were not more than suffficient to cover the out-of-pocket costs or that they were confiscatory.\n The Commission was required to decide whether, in respect of the joint rates, the carriers had discharged the duties imposed upon them by section 1(4), i.e., 'to establish just, reasonable, and equitable divisions thereof as between the carriers ... participating therein which shall not unduly prefer or prejudice any of such participating carriers.' The prescribing of divisions is a legislative function. \n18\n Exertion of that power by the Commission is conditioned upon its finding after a full hearing that \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 357]\n\u00a0\n the divisions then in force do not, or in the future will not, comply with the specified standards. In proceedings to determine and prescribe divisions the Commission is governed by sections 1(4), 15(6), 15a(2), 49 U. S.C.A.  (4), 15(6), 15a(2); it is not required or authorized to investigate or determine whether the joint rates are reasonable or confiscatory. The question whether it complied with the requirements of the act does not depend upon the level of the rates or the amounts of revenue to be divided. The purpose of the provisions just cited is to empower and require the Commission to make divisions that colloquially may be said to be fair. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n But this does not imply that, without regard to amount, the carriers are bound to accept prescribed divisions. Congress is without power, directly or through the Commission, to require them to serve the public at rates that are confiscatory. When made in accordance with the act, the Commission's orders prescribing divisions are the equivalent of Acts of Congress requiring the carriers to serve for the amounts specified. Taken, as they must be, in connection with the duties to the public imposed by law upon the carriers, they command service and for that purpose expropriate the use of carriers' property. If when made the prescribed divisions are or later shall become less than just compensation, the carriers may not be required to serve therefor. 20 And, if after appropriate effort they fail to obtain divisions of nonconfiscatory joint rates that do constitute just compensation for their services including the use of their properties, \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 358]\n\u00a0\n the carriers may be suit in equity have the order prescribing, or requiring to be kept in force, the challenged divisions adjudged void and its enforcement permanently enjoined. 21 Section 15(6) 49 U.S.C.A.  15(6 ), requires the Commission on complaint of any participating carrier to determine whether existing divisions are just, reasonable and equitable and, if not, to prescribe others that do comply with the law. Its denial of relief from existing divisions operates to direct service under them. Though negative in form, the order of denial is affirmative in effect. In some circumstances carriers may accept rates or divisions that do not yield enough to cover operating expenses and taxes that are fairly apportionable to the service plus a reasonable return for the use of their railroads. If revenues yielded exceed the amounts by which operating expenses are increased on account of the service covered by such charges, then legitimately the carriers' net earnings may thus be enhanced. When conditions permit, such rates or divisions may be established and kept in force without detriment to competing carriers, shippers, other transportation, or the public. Just as an owner may sell his property for less than the amount he would be entitled to have upon expropriation, so may carriers, conditions warranting it, render service for less than, by exertion of sovereign power, they could be compelled to accept.\n\n 1. \nAppellants maintain that the order is arbitrary and in excess of statutory power 'because the commission erroneously subordinated all matters, which under section 15(6) ... it is required to consider to the element of southern lines' supposed 'financial need.\"\n In substance, Congress by that paragraph authorizes the Commission to take into account all that is relevant to the ascertainment of fair divisions. While presumed \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 359]\n\u00a0\n valid, its order may be annulled if shown to rest on a misconstruction of the act or upon inadequate or unsupported findings of fact. 22 The Commission alone is authorized to decide upon weight of evidence or significance of facts. There is no single test by which 'just,' 'reasonable,' or 'equitable' divisions may be ascertained; no fact or group of facts may be used generally as a measure by which to determine what division will conform to these standards. Considerations that reasonably guide to decision in one case may rightly be deemed to have little or no bearing in other cases. Error as to the weight to be given financial needs, operating costs or other material facts is not a misconstruction of the act.\n The report shows that the Commission received much evidence bearing upon the standards set by section 15(6) to govern it in making the divisions. Appellants' claim that the order rests exclusively upon the sout ern lines' financial needs is negatived by the record. Many other facts were shown to have been presented and considered. There is no requirement that the Commission specify the weight given to any item of evidence or fact or disclose mental operations by which its decisions are reached. \n23\n Useful precision in respect of either would be impossible. And it would be futile upon the record to attempt defi- \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 360]\n\u00a0\n nitely to ascertain the weight assigned to any fact or argument in prescribing the divisions. We find no support for appellants' claim.\n\n 2. \nAppellants also maintain that the order is in excess of power granted by the act because, as they assert, the Commission considered rates of return from the carriers' entire operations on all their railroad property instead of fair return from transportation of citrus fruit on the use fairly attributable to that service.\n More specificially, the substance of their claim is that the Commission transgressed or disregarded the clause of section 15(6) which requires that it 'shall give due consideration, among other things, to ... the amount of revenue required to pay their respective operating expenses, taxes, and a fair return on their railway property held for and used in the service of transportation.' Their contention assumes and depends upon a construction of the quoted clause that would limit consideration of the return to services covered by the divisions under consideration and prohibit taking into account returns from all service. But that is not the meaning of the clause. The language, 'property held for and used in the service of transportation,' is broad enough to include all carrier property. It requires no discussion to demonstrate that section 15(6) authorizes the Commission to take into account and give due weight to revenues from all transportation service, the operating expenses and taxes chargeable to the same and the amounts available as compensation for the use of all carrier property. And unquestionably the paragraph also empowers the Commission to take into account the revenues, expenses, taxes, and returns attributable to the service covered by the divisions under consideration. The record shows that the Commission received and considered evidence in relation to both these matters of fact. \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 361]\n\u00a0\n The question whether the carriers in the southern or northern groups were in the worse financial position was a close and difficult one. After full hearing, the Commission decided that the needs of the southern lines were greater. It appears to have given much weight to that fact. Four members dissented and filed an opinion in which they compared and commented on the prescribed divisions in substance as follows:\n For a haul of 600 miles the northern factor is 87 and the southern 161. The latter is 85 per cent. higher than the former. The average hauls are about 825 miles in the south and 375 miles in the north. For these distances the factors are 194 for the south and 60 for the north, or 0.235 per mile for the longer haul in the south and 0.160 per mile for the shorter haul in the north. The advantage per mile is 47 per cent. for the south. Taking into consideration the respective lengths of haul and the fact that divisions, like rates, should decrease per mile as the length of haul increases, this 47 per cent. checks will within the 85 per cent. in the first test.\n For the average southern haul of 825 miles the southern factor is 94 per cent. of the corresponding first-class rate whereas the northern factor is 62.5 per cent. Yet the southern class rates average more than 30 per cent. higher than the eastern class rates, and the Commissi n has several times found that this difference is not fully justified by transportation conditions.\n Transportation conditions in Florida are less favorable than in the South generally; but a Florida arbitrary is added to the rate. It is deducted before proration and added to the southern division of the balance of the joint rate. Gathering expense is high but so is delivery expense at destination. The Commission was obliged to lean heavily on history and on the fact that, while both sets of carriers are badly off financially, the southern lines appear to be worse off than the northern. Historical \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 362]\n\u00a0\n considerations were not entitled to much weight. While financial need is important, the report and order of the Commission gave it too much weight.\n The wide difference of opinion among the members may suggest doubt as to some basic findings of fact, but it gives no support to appellants' claim that the Commission acted arbitrarily or in excess of powers granted by the act. The legal effect of the challenged report and order is the same as if supported by all members of the Commission. \n24\n Although it may be plain that, if considered without regard to the facts other than relative transportation and costs of the service, the divisions would seem extremely favorable to the southern lines, the Commission's findings based on evidence and its determination as to the significance of pertinent facts found are conclusive. Appellants' contention cannot be sustained.\n\n 3. \nBefore taking up appellants' claim of confiscation, some preliminary questions require consideration.\n At the trial the United States and Commission moved that no evidence be received other than that contained in the record before the Commission. The court denied the motion. Counsel for the United States and Commission do not here claim that the ruling was erroneous. But it has been suggested that the trial court should not have received evidence other than that introduced before the Commission; that it was not permitted to make findings, but was bound to accept those of the Commission if supported by evidence. Decisions in lower Federal courts \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 363]\n\u00a0\n touching the points thus raised are not harmonious. \n25\n Their determination has an important bearing upon the decision here to be made. It is therefore necessary to decide what, in respect of admission and consideration of evidence, should have been the scope of the trial in the District Court. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n There is no statute that can be held to limit as suggested trial of an issue of confiscation. No question as to compensation in the constitutional sense was raised by the complaints to the Commission. The issues there concerned only the fairness of divisions. Prior to the taking effect of the order appellants filed a petition for rehearing in which they claimed that its enforcement would confiscate their property; they then made substantially the same contentions as they make in this suit and sought opportunity to support them by evidence in order to obtain the Commission's findings of fact and ecision upon the question of confiscation. But the Commission denied their application. That denial of hearing amounted to a command of the Commission that, notwithstanding their petition to it invoking constitutional protection, appellants must make the specified adjustment involving the payment of enormous sums and use their property to serve the public for the compensation specified in the order. As the carriers' application to the Commission for just, reasonable, and equitable divisions under section 15(6) raised no question of confiscation, its findings in the report may not be construed as addressed to that issue. \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 364]\n\u00a0\n 4. There is a wide and fundamental difference between the question whether the Commission, in prescribing divisions found by it to be just, reasonable, and equitable, complied with the procedural requirements of the act, and whether, if enforced against objecting carriers, the order will confiscate their property. The Commission's findings of fact in the field first mentioned, if based on evidence, are conclusive. But, upon the question whether prescribed divisions constitute just compensation within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, Congress is without power conclusively to bind the carriers. As the Congress itself could not be, so it cannot make its agents be, the final judge of its own power under the Constitution. Congress has no power to make final determination of just compensation or to prescribe what constitutes due process of law for its ascertainment. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n In Chicago, M. & St. P.R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418\n, 10 S.Ct. 462, 702, this court held repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment a Minnesota statute construed to provide that rates prescribed by the state Commission shall be final and conclusive as to what are equal and reasonable charges and that as to reasonableness there can be no judicial inquiry. The court said (\n134 U.S. 418\n at page 458, 10 S.Ct. 462, 467, 702): 'The question of the reasonableness of a rate of charge for transportation by a railroad company, involving, as it does, the element of reasonableness both as regards the company and as regards the public, is eminently a question for judicial investigation, requiring due process of law for its determination. If the company is deprived of the power of charging reasonable rates for the use of its property, and such deprivation takes place in the absence of an investigation by judicial machinery, it is deprived of the lawful use of its property, and thus, \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 365]\n\u00a0\n in substance and effect, of the property itself, without due process of law, and in violation of the constitution of the United States.'\n In Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312\n, 13 S.Ct. 622, this court held repugnant to the Fifth Amendment an act of Congress purporting to exclude an element of value. It said (\n148 U.S. 312\n, at page 327, 13 S.Ct. 622, 626): 'By this legislation congress seems to have assumed the right to determine what shall be the measure of compensation. But this is a judicial, and not a legislative, question. The legislature may determine what private property is needed for public purposes; that is a question of a political and legislative character. But when the taking has been ordered, then the question of compensation is judicial. It does not rest with the public, taking the property, through congress or the legislature, its representative, to say what compensation shall be paid, or even what shall be the rule of compensation. The constitution has declared that just compensation shall be paid, and the ascertainment of that is a judicial inquiry.'\n In Reagan v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362\n, 14 S.Ct. 1047, a fully considered case presenting the question whether a Circuit Court of the United States had power to enjoin enforcement of confiscatory state-made railroad rates, this court, upon an abundance of authority found in the earlier decisions, held that it had. The opinion declares (\n154 U.S. 362\n, at page 399, 14 S.Ct. 1047, 1055): 'These cases all support the proposition that, while it is not the province of the courts to enter upon the merely administrative duty of framing a tariff of rates for carriage, it is within the scope of judicial power, and a part of judicial duty, to restrain anything which, in the form of a regulation of rates, operates to deny to the owners of property invested in the business of transportation that equal protection which is the constitutional right of all owners of other property. There is nothing \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 366]\n\u00a0\n new or strange in this. It has always been a part of the judicial function to determine whether the act of one party (whether that party be a single individual, an organized body, or the public as a whole) operates to divest the other party of any rights of person or property. In every constitution is the guaranty against the taking of private property for public purposes without just compensation. The equal protection of the laws, which, by the fourteenth amendment, no state can deny to the individual, forbids legislation, in whatever form it may be enacted, by which the property of one individual is, without compensation, wrested from him for the benefit of another, or of the public. This, as has been often observed, is a government of law, and not a government of men; and it must never be forgotten that under such a government, with its constitutional limitations and guaranties, the forms of law and the machinery of government, with all their reach and power, must, in their actual workings, stop on the hither side of the unnecessary and uncompensated taking or destruction of any private property, legally acquired and legally held.'\n Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299\n, 43 S.Ct. 354, was a suit to recover just compensation for expropriated land. A jury found value at the time of the taking. The District Court entered judgment for that amount with interest from the date of taking. The Circuit Court of Appeals (280 F. 349) held the owner not entitled to interest. Here its judgment was reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. We said (\n261 U.S. 299\n, at page 306, 43 S.Ct. 354, 356): 'The Constitution safeguards the right (to just compensation) and section 10 of the Lever Act directs payment. The rule above referred to, that in the absence of agreement to pay or statute allowing it (Jud.Code  177, 28 U.S.C.  284, 28 U.S.C.A.  284) the United States will not be held liable for interest on unpaid accounts and claims, does not apply here. The requirement \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 367]\n\u00a0\n that 'just compensation' shall be paid is comprehensive and includes all elements and no specific command to include interest is necessary when interest or its equivalent is a part of such compensation.'\n United States v. New River Collieries Co., \n262 \nU.S. 341\n, 43 S.Ct. 565, involved the question of pay for requisitioned coal. We said (\n262 U.S. 341\n, at pages 343, 344, 43 S.Ct. 565, 567): 'The ascertainment of compensation is a judicial function, and no power exists in any other department of the government to declare what the compensation shall be, or to prescribe any binding rule in that regard.' See Davis v. Newton Coal Co., \n267 \nU.S. 292, 301\n, 45 S.Ct. 305; Phelps v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 341\n, 47 S.Ct. 611.\n In West v. Chesapeake & P. Tel. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 652\n, 55 S.Ct. 894, called upon to decide whether the order of a state Commission prescribing charges for telephone service was confiscatory, we said (\n295 U.S. 662\n, at page 671, 55 S.Ct. 894, 897): 'When the property itself is taken by the exertion of the power of eminent domain, just compensation is its value at the time of the taking. o, where by legislation prescribing rates or charges the use of the property is taken, just compensation assured by these constitutional provisions is a reasonable rate of return upon that value.'\n St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 80 L.Ed. --, presented the question whether an order of the Secretary of Agriculture prescribing rates for stockyards services was confiscatory. The case was submitted to the District Court upon the evidence contained in the record before the secretary. This court was called on to decide whether the District Court was required to weigh the evidence. We answered affirmatively. We said (\n298 U.S. 38\n, at page 51, 56 S.Ct. 720, 726, 80 L. Ed. --): 'When the Legislature acts directly, its action is subject to judicial scrutiny and determination in order to prevent the transgression of these (constitutional) limits of power. The Legislature cannot preclude that scrutiny or determination by any declaration \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 368]\n\u00a0\n or legislative finding. Legislative declaration or finding is necessarily subject to independent judicial review upon the facts and the law by courts of competent jurisdiction to the end that the Constitution as the supreme law of the land may be maintained. Nor can the Legislature escape the constitutional limitation by authorizing its agent to make findings that the agent has kept within that limitation. ... It is said that we can retain judicial authority to examine the weight of evidence when the question concerns the right of personal liberty. But, if this be so, it is not because we are privileged to perform our judicial duty in that case and for reasons of convenience to disregard it in others. The principle applies when rights either of person or of property are protected by constitutional restrictions. Under our system there is no warrant for the view that the judicial power of a competent court can be circumscribed by any legislative arrangement designed to give effect to administrative action going beyond the limits of constitutional authority.'\n The just compensation clause may not be evaded or impaired by any form of legislation. Against the objection of the owner of private property taken for public use, the Congress may not directly or through any legislative agency finally determine the amount that is safeguarded to him by that clause. If as to the value of his property the owner accepts legislative or administrative determinations or challenges them merely upon the ground that they were not made in accordance with statutes governing a subordinate agency, no constitutional question arises. But, when he appropriately invokes the just compensation clause, he is entitled to a judicial determination of the amount. The due process clause assures a full hearing before the court or other tribunal empowered to perform the judicial function \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 369]\n\u00a0\n involved. That includes the right to introduce evidence28 and have judicial findings based upon it. \n 29\n\u00a0\n\n\n 5. \nAlthough not suggested by appellees, it is here urged that the lower court was without power to consider the question whether the order is confiscatory. Grounds taken are that appellants did not seasonably raise that issue or present their evidence upon it to the Commission, and that in respect of divisions, as distinguished from the joint rates to be divided, confiscation can never be the ultimate issue.\n But neither group of carriers claimed before the Commission or here asserts that the joint rates are not sufficient to permit nonconfiscatory divisions that are just, reasonable, and equitable within the meaning of section 15(6). By failure to suggest the contrary, they virtually concede them adequate for all purposes. The order prohibits the application of any other divisions, and, unless enjoined, must be given effect according to its terms. It directs adjustment on the prescribed basis on shipments made after November 22, 1930. Railroad Com'rs of Florida v. Aberdeen & Rockfish R. Co., 144 I.C.C. 603. If that part of the order is carried into effect, the amounts to be paid under it by the northern lines to the southern lines will exceed, as asserted by appellants, $1,200,000. \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 370]\n\u00a0\n And the application of the prescribed basis to future shipments will correspondingly reduce northern lines' compensation.\n They could not foresee that confiscatory restitution would be required or that confiscatory divisions would be prescribed; they were not bound, in advance of the Commission's findings and report, to set up a fear of transgression of their constitutional rights. Presumably the commission would keep within the law. The boundaries of the power conferred upon it by section 15(6) had been clearly defined. Expounding that provision, we had held: 'It is settled that, in determining what the divisions should be, the Commission may, in the public interest, take into consideration the financial needs of a weaker road, and that it may be given a division larger than justice merely as between the parties would suggest 'in order to maintain it in effective operation as part of an adequate transportation system,' provided the share left to its connections is 'adequate to avoid a confiscatory result.\"30 The limitation noted in that statement merely applies the principle that 'there is no place in our constitutional system for the exercise of arbitrary power.' \n31\n\u00a0\n\n Appellees do not claim that appellants were required to or could have raised the question of confiscation upon the proposed report of the Examiners. That report is not a part of the record. At the trial appellants offered it in evidence. The Commission objected to it on the ground that it is 'a mere recommendation of an employee of the commission to the commission.' The court sustained the objection. The report of the Commission \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 371]\n\u00a0\n does not disclose the Examiners' recommendations, but states that its conclusions differ somewhat from those proposed by the Examiners. For the reason given in the Commission's objection, upon which the court excluded what the Examiners proposed to the Commission, the appellants would not have been justified in raising the question of confiscation upon the proposed report.\n No act of Congress requires carriers, in advance of suit to set aside divisions or other orders, to petition the commission for rehearing, repeal or modification. Nor has Congress attempted to limit the time within which the carrier may sue to enjoin enforcement of an order of the Commission prescribing rates or divisions. That is so for the reason, among others, that divisions valid when made may later become confiscatory. 32 For example, the evidence as to the cost of service introduced before the Commission and at the trial was based on operations in 1929. The appellants were not given and could not obtain a hearing before the Commission upon the question of confiscation. Their failure earlier to invoke constitutional protection does not bar this suit. That they diligently sought relief from the Commission is shown in the latter's brief here in which, justifying or explaining its denial of the second petition for rehearing, it says: 'When the Commission denied the second petition, it already had before it and had considered the proffered evidence in support of the claim of confiscation that appellants desired it to consider, as well as the entire record of the previous hearings, much of the testimony in which consisted of cost calculations and other statistical data offered by the appellants.' Appellants conformed to practice appropriate and desirable as indicated \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 372]\n\u00a0\n in Manufacturers' R. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 489\n, 38 S.Ct. 383, and recently expounded in St. Joseph Stock Yards Company v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 80 L.Ed. --.\n Appellants appropriately invoked judicial power to obtain constitutional protection against the Commission's order. The District Court rightly held them entitled to introduce evidence in addition to that contained in the record before the Commission and rightly proceeded upon consideration of all the evidence to make findings, and, upon the basis of the facts that it found, to decide upon the constitutional question.\n\n 6. \nAs to proof of confiscation.\n By this appeal we are required to analyze findings of the Commission and of the court, in so far as they bear upon the question of confiscation, and, to the extent that may be found necessary, to review the evidence and to decide whether appellants have proved, with the degree of certainty required in cases such as this, that the enforcement of the Commission's order will operate to deprive them of their property without due process of law or to take its use for the service of the public without just compensation in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. \n33\n\u00a0\n\n The Commission having refused to consider the question of confiscation, we are deprived of the benefits of its analysis of the evidence, findings of fact, and inferences based upon them that necessarily would have been involved in its determination of the question whether the prescribed divisions are and for a reasonable time in the \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 373]\n\u00a0\n immediate future will be sufficient to constitute just compensation within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment for the services covered by the divisions.\n o warrant reversal in so far as the order directs adjustment and refund, it must clearly appear from the evidence before us that its enforcement, in respect of the period involved, would leave appellants less than enough to cover operating expenses, taxes, and just compensation for the use of their property fairly attributable to the service covered by the divisions. To warrant reversal of the decree in other respects, the evidence must show that the prescribed divisions were and in the future will be confiscatory.\n Appellees' suggestion that the challenged report and order come to this court upon concurrent findings of the Commission and District Court is without force. Denial without more of the second petition for rehearing involved no finding of fact. It was merely a refusal to pass upon the question of confiscation then for the first time presented. And, as the Commission in prescribing divisions acted legislatively and not judicially, the rule, that where two courts have reached the same conclusion on a question of fact it will be accepted here unless clearly erroneous, does not apply.\n Appellants' method of calculation. For each carrier figure system costs per car mile thus: Ascertain from its reports to the Commission operating expenses and taxes; apportion total between freight and passenger according to formula prescribed by the Commission; from freight expense deduct cost of car repairs, depreciation, and retirements; divide remainder by total freight car miles and to the quotient add 2 cents per mile paid for use and maintenance of refrigerator cars used to haul citrus fruit. The result is taken to represent the cost per car mile of transportation of that freight. It depends upon the assumption that citrus fruit car mile cost is at least as high as the average of system car mile cost. \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 374]\n\u00a0\n To ascertain property value apportionable to the service covered by the prescribed divisions: Divide investment in road and equipment as reported to Commission on the basis of freight operating expenses-less cost of repair, depreciation, and retirement of freight cars-to total operating expenses, and take such proportion of value so assigned to freight as citrus fruit car miles are to total freight car miles. Citrus fruit net revenues divided by value assigned to that traffic gives rate of return.\n The shipping season of 1928-29 was the test period. There were hauled 17,324 carloads by the Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line from Florida points to Richmond, Virginia; and by the Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac to Potomac Yards; whence the Pennsylvania hauled the larger part, and the Baltimore & Ohio the rest, to destinations. Comparison of expenses determined by application of the estimated citrus fruit car mile cost with revenues calculated on the basis of the challenged divisions follows:\n Revenues Expenses Deficit\n R., F. & P $411,051.64 $412,311.20 $ 1,259.56 Pennsylvania 748,339.98 813,918.88 65,578.90 B. & O. 87,845.90 74,477.23 13,368.67 *\n * Surplus.\n In the same season 4,662 carloads of citrus fruit from Florida were hauled by southern carriers to other gateways named in the order and by northern lines thence to destinations in central territory. Calculations on the same basis indicate revenues $285,064.02, estimated expenses $232, 456.87, surplus $52,607.15. Appellants say of this surplus $39,644.92 is accounted for by 1,253 cars, hauled a short distance by northern carriers, affected by minimum provisions of the order, and that the cost assigned to them is understated.\n Comparisons of divisions. Divisions of revenues from 29,221 cars hauled to destination in Trunk Line and New\n\n\n[298 U.S. 349, 375]\n\u00a0\n England Territory, as settled, amounted to about $285,000 less than if made on mileage prorate. Divisions on basis prescribed by the order would have been about $600,000 less than if made on mileage prorate. The prescribed divisions on shipments to New York and Philadelphia are more than 94 per cent. of local rates from the south to Richmond and are less than 35 per cent. of local rates north from Richmond. Southern weighted average hauls calculated on short line distances were 810 miles and the northern 358 miles. Contrary to the established general rule, the order prescribes higher divisions per mile for the longer than for the shorter haul. The average earning per loaded car mile south was 31.4 cents and north 21 cents.\n Appellants claim that the cost per citrus fruit car mile is greater than the average of all. To support that contention they emphasize evidence introduced to support these facts: Refrigerator cars used are very much heavier than the cars used to haul dead freight; additional inspection service is required, hauling over road and handling in terminals is more expeditious than that given to ordiary cars. There are required at destination relatively very expensive produce terminals. Diversions and reconsignments are more frequent. Expedited service requires, at intermediate and final terminals, more employees for inspection, repairing, and keeping records than otherwise would be necessary, extra engines and crews are required promptly to classify, to switch to icehouses, to effect reconsignments, to make up trains and to haul them. The relatively high percentage of empty car movement makes it hard to balance movement in both directions and frequently requires operation of locomotives over the road without cars.\n Appellants cite a statement in the report of the Commission to the effect that in general the evidence indicates that citrus fruit like other perishable traffic is \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 376]\n\u00a0\n given a specialized, expedited service which is undoubtedly more expensive than the ordinary run of freight. They refer to the testimony of experts who expressed opinion to the effect that the cost of transporting citrus fruit was greater than the average cost of handling all freight, to evidence tending to show that physical conditions, such as bridges, grades, tunnels, complex terminals affecting operating conditions on those portions of northern lines used for the transportation of relatively large amounts of citrus fruit, are more adverse than on their respective systems as a whole.\n They draw comparisons indicating 10.56 cents to be the Baltimore & Ohio system average cost per car mile as against 14.61 cents on the operating division over part of which most of its citrus fruit is hauled; correspondingly 10.95 cents appears to be the Pennsylvania system average as against 11.59 cents for its Eastern Region and New York Zone over a part of which most of its citrus fruit is hauled. \n34\n Basing the statement on mere opinion of an expert, they say that on hauls over the Pennsylvania line through Baltimore and Philadelphia to New York the transportation expense alone was 14.2 cents per car mile.\n They claim that tested by the car mile study the prescribed divisions failed by substantial margins to afford any return to the Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac or to the Pennsylvania, and that they afforded a return to the Baltimore & Ohio of only 4.42 per cent.\n Appellants maintain that the principles underlying their estimates of cost are sound and that the assumptions \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 377]\n\u00a0\n made are reasonable. Conceding that they have not proved what the exact cost per car mile chargeable to citrus fruit was in the test period, or has been since or what it will be in the future, they refer to decisions of the Commission35 and of this Court36 recognizing the impossibility of making exact proof of cost of transportation of any commodity and indicating that sometimes resort must be had to system average costs. They emphasize the fact that railway cost accounting cannot with exactness apportion to one commodity its fair proportion of cost incurred in common with transportation of other freight or of passengers, insist that special cost studies in this case would have been impracticable; urge that they should not be held to impracticable exactness, and that reasonable determinations are sufficient. \n37\n\u00a0\n\n Appellees call attention to the Commission's rejection of the average unit costs as a method of approximating cost of handling a single commodity. \n38\n They seek to discredit appellants' method by showing it would prove confiscatory the divisions that for a long time they had accepted. Their evidence tends to show: Much of the operating expenses chargeable to maintenance of way, maintenance of equipment, and transportation is not affected by volume of traffic, and therefore the greater the \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 378]\n\u00a0\n number of units of service the less the cost per unit; the very large volume of citrus fruit hauled by the Pennsylvania from Potomac Yards makes for low cost per car mile. Terminal services are not affected by length of haul. The Pennsylvania citrus fruit average haul loaded and empty being much greater than the system average haul, apportionment on a car mile basis makes for excessive assignment of terminal operating expenses to citrus fruit. And they rightly say that opinions of experts unsupported by adequate actual tests may not safely be substituted for concrete data. \n39\n\u00a0\n\n The burden on appellants, heavy though it is, does not require them to prove with arithmetical accuracy the cost of the transportation covered by the challenged divisions or the value of the property used to perform it, or the proportion attributable to that service. It is enough, if the evidence preponderating in their favor reasonably warrants findings sufficient to support the decree sought. Many issues as to which demonstrable accuracy is impossible have to be decided by the courts. In ascertaining cost of transportation of one out of many commodities hauled by railroads it is impossible to attain precision. Mere lack of it is not ground for objection either to the evidence offered or the facts which it tends to prove. \n40\n\u00a0\n\n We may say at once that no substantial weight is to be given to appellants' comparison of divisions prescribed for northern carriers with those given the southern lines. As shown above, the Commission acting under section 15(6) was dealing merely with fairness of divisions of a joint \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 379]\n\u00a0\n rate and not with just compensation within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.\n The Commission's statement to the ffect that citrus fruit transportation service 'is undoubtedly more expensive than the ordinary run of freight' is not entitled to any weight for it does not appear that the statement referred to cost per car mile. For aught that appears, some other unit may have been meant. And, as they lack disclosed definite bases of established fact, no weight may be given to cited opinions of appellants' expert witnesses to the effect that citrus fruit car mile cost is higher than system average.\n Nor is there any force in appellees' suggestion to the effect that the evidence on which appellants seek to prove the prescribed divisions confiscatory would similarly condemn divisions that they accepted for a long time prior to the reduction of the joint rates November 9, 1928. As shown above, carriers advantageously to themselves and the public may and sometimes do apply rates and divisions that are lower than they could be compelled by law to accept.\n The test period 1928-29 ended more than one year before the first complaint to the Commission, four years before its final decision and the commencement of this suit, five years before entry of the decree appealed from and six years before submission to this court. In that period there intervened a profound business depression out of which there has been some progress. \n41\n The evidence fails to show that the relation of citrus fruit car mile cost to the system average has remained the same as appellants claim it was in the test period. Appellants should have brought forward evidence and estimates based on operations subsequent to the complaint, No- \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 380]\n\u00a0\n vember 22, 1930, and also as near as possible to the time of trial in the district court. The order prescribing the challenged division has been in effect for a long time and in the absence of proof clearly showing that on the basis of present and prospective conditions it is confiscatory, its enforcement ought not to be enjoined.\n Appellants' evidence was addressed primarily to the question whether as to citrus fruit traffic moving through the Richmond gateway the prescribed divisions were confiscatory. In determining whether as to any carrier that evidence was sufficient, appellants' estimated citrus fruit car mile cost is of prime importance. A slight variation in that figure is sufficient to change the balance from one side of the account to the other; to change surplus revenue to deficit. If since the order took effect that cost has been or in the immediate future will be substantially less than the contemporaneous system car mile cost, appellants' proof is not sufficient to show confiscation. It is very difficult to attain the high degree of certainty in respect of this vital factor that is obviously necessary to make dependable proof.\n Operating expenses are incurred in innumerable services, few of which, if any, are the same in respect of car mile cost as is the transportation of citrus fruit here in question. There are many elements that affect system average that have no relation to citrus fruit car mile costs. It would seem that, without specific knowledge of details of operation affecting cost during representative periods, no dependble opinion could be reached as to the cost relationship on which the appellants' case depends.\n The facts that they brought forward to show that citrus fruit car mile cost is at least as high as the system average undoubtedly tend in a general way to aid that contention. But they lack useful certainty. Appellees' criticisms, above referred to, are substantial and at least sufficient reasonably to warn against acceptance of ap- \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 381]\n\u00a0\n pellants' claim. A very small part of the Pennsylvania system mileage is used to haul substantial quantities of Florida citrus fruit The principal volume moves over the lines north from Potomac Yards. Ordinarily, density of such traffic would make for lower car mile cost. Appellants claim that there it is relatively high, but the evidence fails adequately to support that contention. Appellants' failure to introduce evidence based on observations or tests made contemporaneously with transportation in representative periods subsequent to the taking effect of the order and near to the time of trial strongly suggests that the figures on which appellants' calculations are based could not be supported and leaves in grave doubt the validity of their proof.\n We conclude that the evidence is not sufficient to establish with requisite certainty what has been or will be the cost of the service covered by the prescribed divisions and that the District Court rightly dismissed the suit.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (concurring).\n I agree that the suit is without merit and that the District Court was right in dismissing the bill. Two objections to the order of the Commission, unsubstantial but otherwise proper subjects for judicial review, were disposed of briefly below and have rightly received like treatment here. It is the third objection-the claim of 'confiscation' to which the attention of both courts has been directed. That claim imposed upon the lower court six days of hearings. It imposed upon this Court a reargument and a huge record. With the briefs, it weighs avoirdupois 67 pounds. The narrative statement of the testimony occupies 1,237 pages of the printed record in this Court; the briefs fill 546 pages. There are, besides, 428 exhibits. In my opinion, the applicable rules of procedure forbade the lower court from passing upon the \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 382]\n\u00a0\n question of 'confiscation' in this suit. If 'confiscation' is threatened, there is ample remedy; but the redress must be sought in a different proceeding.\n First. The question on which I differ from the Court is this: Where, in a suit to set aside a divisions-order, under the Urgent Deficiency Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219 (28 U.S.C.A.  41(28) the Court concludes that there was, in entering the order, no error of law or of fact and no irregularity of procedure or abuse of discretion, may it proceed to inquire into a charge, not seasonably made before the Commission, that the divisions-order would result in 'confiscation' when applied to the through rates prescribed by a rate-order then in force, which rate-order had been acquiesced in by all participating carriers and was not then under review? In my opinion, the answer should be 'No.' For, if the charged 'confiscation' is due to the alleged inadequacy of the prescribed through rates, the appropriate remedy is to apply to the Commission to revise the rate-order. If the charged 'confiscation' is due to alleged failure of the Commission to allot to the complaining carriers their fair share of an adequate through rate, they are barred from complaining in this suit, because they failed seasonably to raise, before the Commission, that issue and present there the evidence in support thereof. They could of course apply to the Commission to modify the order so as to make it just for the future.\n While the Commission may, at any time, modify or supersede an order, no court has power to set an order aside except for inherent error or procedural irregularity. To hold that this divisions-order may be set aside because 'confiscation' will result if it is applied in connection with the rate-order not under review, and not objected to, would make of that claim a paramount and prerogative right hitherto unknown to the law.\n Second. The treatment of the suit as a 'confiscation case' has led to serious misconceptions. The term 'con- \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 383]\n\u00a0\n fiscation' is appropriately used only in a proceeding for the fixing of rates, where the objection is made that the Commission, in prescribing rates, made them so low that they are not compensatory; and that the government is thereby taking private property for the public without paying compensation. The order under review is not a rate-order. It is an order under section 15(6) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  15( 6), which fixes, as between the carriers participating in existing through rates, 'just, reasonable, and equitable divisions,' but leaves the through rate undisturbed. Ordinarily, divisions of through rates are governed by agreement between the carriers. It is only where they fail to agree that an application is made under that section.\n In a proceeding to fix 'just, reasonable, and equitable divisions,' 'confiscation' can never be an ultimate issue. For, as a matter of substantive law, the fact that the share allotted to one is not compensatory is without legal significance. The Commission's task is solely to make a fair division of existing rates. A division, although fair, may conceivably fail to give any of the connecting carriers adequate compensation for the service rendered, because the through rate-the thing to be divided-is itself inadequate. Or conceivably, the through rate may be so generous that all participants will receive compensatory divisions, although, as between themselves, the division itself is unfair. The fact that the share assigned to one is noncompensatory will be of evidential value if accompanied by evidence that some other carrier is receiving better treatment. But, unless it appears that some other carrier was so favored, the noncompensatory character of the division would be entirely immaterial. And even when relevant, may be of little or no weight because of other considerations.\n At best, the noncompensatory character of the share, if proved, would be only one of the many subsidiary \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 384]\n\u00a0\n evidential facts which Congress, by section 15(6), has commanded the Commission to take into consideration in determining what a fair division is. These are, 'among other things,' 'the efficiency with which the carriers concerned are operated, the amount of revenue required to pay their respective operating expenses, taxes, and a fair return on their railway property held for and used in the service of transportation, and the importance to the public of the transportation services of such carriers; and also whether any particular participating carrier is an originating, intermediate, or delivering line, and any other fact or circumstance which would ordinarily, without regard to the mileage haul, entitle one carrier to a greater or less proportion than another carrier of the joint rate, fare or charge.'\n Thus, a division may be 'just, reasonable and equitable,' although it allots to one carrier a noncompensatory share and to another carrier a compensatory share, because it was inefficiency in operation by the former which rendered its share noncompensatory. Or, the seemingly preferential treatment of the latter might be justified by the fact that it was the originating carrier, and hence entitled by established transportation practice to the larger share of the through rate.\n If inadequacy of a prescribed through rate is the reason why the share of one of the participating carriers is noncompensatory it has ample remedies under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Constitution. It may, at any time, apply to the Commission for an increase of the through rate; and if the increase is improperly denied, a remedy is available in the courts by a 'confiscation' suit. That remedy would be open although the prescribed rate had been acquiesced in; for every rate order is subject to revision at any time upon application to the Commission. A divisions-order, likewise, is always subject to revision; \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 385]\n\u00a0\n but change in the through rate would not necessarily render the existing decisions unfair.\n Third. The through rates which the Commission was requested to divide in the proceeding under review are those on citrus fruit from Florida to points north of the Potomac and Ohio rivers. These had been prescribed by order entered July 10, 1928, Railroad Commissioners of Florida v. Aberdeen & R ckfish R. Co., 144 I.C.C. 603; and the level of rates thereby prescribed was acquiesced in. That order did not deal with divisions. The divisions governing the Florida citrus fruit traffic had, for many years prior to July 10, 1928, been fixed by agreement. After entry of that order ( which reduced the through rates on the average about 67 cents a ton), there developed a controversy as to the divisions. Being unable to agree, all the carriers-the southern lines by original complaint, the northern lines by cross-complaint-applied to the Commission, under section 15(6) of the Interstate Commerce Act, and asked it to fix the 'just, reasonable, and equitable divisions.' By order entered July 3, 1933, the Commission did so, Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Arcade & Attica R. Co., 194 I.C.C. 729. It is that divisions-order which it is sought to have set aside with a view to having the share of the northern carriers increased at the expense of the southern. Two alleged errors of law charged to the Commission were quickly disposed of by the court as being unsubstantial. Did it commit any error of law or of fact; or was it guilty of an abuse of discretion in respect to the claim of 'confiscation'?\n The proceedings which resulted in the entry of the divisions order, and the efforts to have it set aside, were as follows:\n\n\n (a)\n The southern lines filed their complaint with the Commission on November 22, 1930. The cross-complaint \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 386]\n\u00a0\n of the northern lines followed on April 20, 1931. Hearings began on May 11, 1931, and continued for more than seven months. Briefs were filed before the Examiners. When their proposed report was submitted to the parties, both sides filed exceptions. In the proceedings before the Examiners there was no claim by the northern lines that the divisions sought by the southern lines would be confiscatory. The Examiners' proposed report did not mention that subject; and there was no claim made that divisions recommended by them would be confiscatory. The case was argued orally before the full Commission on the exceptions to the Examiners' report, and extensive briefs were submitted. There was no claim or suggestion before the Commission that the division sought or proposed would be confiscatory. On July 3, 1933, the Commission entered the order for the divisions which it found to be 'just, reasonable, and equitable.' There was no reference to the subject of confiscation in the accompanying report which occupies 34 pages. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Arcade & Attica R. Co., 194 I.C.C. 729-762.\n\n\n (b)\n The northern lines presented a petition requesting that the hearing be reopened for reconsideration on the evidence already introduced and supplemental data called from statistical reports in the Commission's files, which it was agreed should be treated as evidence. On October 9, 1933, the proceedings were reopened as requested to reconsider, upon the evidence originally submitted and that then added, whether there had been an error of judgment in fixing the divisions. There was no claim made in this petiton for a rehearing that the divisions which had been prescribed by the order of July 3, 1933, were confiscatory. The Commission discussed in a supplemental report of 13 pages the errors assigned; concluded that the objections were unfounded; and on January 8, 1934, affirmed the divisions prescribed. There was no reference in the supplemental report to the subject of confiscation. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Arcade & A.R. Co., 198 I.C.C. 375-387. \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 387]\n\u00a0\n (c) On April 27, 1934, the northern carriers presented a second petiton for a rehearing; and with it presented, as additional evidence, 'cost studies.' There was no suggestion that these were, in a legal sense, newly discovered evidence; nor was there a contention that they were evidence of a change in economic or traffic conditions which required that the Commission's conclusion should be changed. The main claim was, as in the first petition for rehearing, that the Commission erred in its judgment. But he second petition contained a claim that the divisions awarded to the northern lines were confiscatory. On May 14, 1934, this second petition was denied without opinion.\n\n\n (d)\n On May 25, 1934, the northern carriers brought this suit in the federal court for Eastern Virginia to set aside the order of July 3, 1933. The bill sought relief on five grounds. Prominent among them was the claim that this division was confiscatory. At the hearing before the three judges, which began on September 17, 1934, and occupied six days, the plaintiffs introduced in evidence a transcript of the evidence before the Commission on which the order complained of had been entered and confirmed, consisting of 2,054 pages of oral testimony and 358 exhibits. Over objections of the defendants the plaintiffs were permitted to introduce additional oral evidence, of which the transcript fills 1,066 pages; also, 70 exhibits. On December 31, 1934, the court entered a final decree dismissing the bill. Its unanimous opinion disposes briefly of the objections other than confiscation. To that subject nearly all of the 18- page opinion is devoted. (D.C.) 9 F.Supp. 181-199.\n\n\n (e)\n The application for appeal to this Court was filed February 26, 1935. Of the grounds for relief set forth in the bill, only three were insisted on at the original argument, namely: (1) That the Commission subordinated all matters which under section 15(6) it was required to take \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 388]\n\u00a0\n into consideration to the single element of the southern lines' supposed financial needs. (2) That, while purporting to give 'due consideration' to a 'fair return' on the railway property of the southern lines, the Commission 'considered only the rates of return of said Southern lines from the entire operations of such lines instead of a fair return on Southern lines' property fairly attributable to the service of transporting citrus fruit.' (3) That the divisions allowed are confiscatory. On the reargument, confiscation was the only subject discussed; and the opinion of the Court deals mainly with it.\n Fourth. Clearly, the Commission did not err either in a ruling of law or a finding of fact as to 'confiscation,' since it made no ruling of finding on that subject. Was it guilty of an abuse of discretion in refusing to pass upon it? Congress conferred upon the Commission power to grant or deny, in its discretion, a petition for rehearing of a decision. Interstate Commerce Act,  16a (49 U.S.C.A.  16a). It may be granted after entry of an order or before; and the case may be reopened to admit additional evidence. The 'cost studies' submitted with the second petition for rehearing were not, in a legal sense, newly discovered evidence. There was a belated offering of evidence in support of a belated contention. The purpose was to introduce, at that late day, more evidence bearing upon the question of what would be fair.\n The refusal to grant the second petition for a rehearing was not an abuse of discretion. Federal appellate courts will not in civil cases, upon review of the judgment of the trial court, consider any objection not seasonably presented below; and an objection first presented in a petition for rehearing which has been denied is not seasonably presented unless in connection with the denial that objection was specifically passed upon. This rule is of general application. It governs the appellate court's action whether the objection raises a constitutional ques- \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 389]\n\u00a0\n tion, or relates to a matter of lesser dignity. No reason has been suggested why that rule should not apply equally to a judicial review by the district courts, and this Court, of the action of the Commission. And no case has been found in which the applicability of the rule to a case like the present has been questioned.\n The case at bar is not like Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248\n, 52 S.Ct. 146, where the order was set aside because the Commission refused to reopen the case and hear additional evidence. That offered was of changed conditions important, because every rate-order is subject to revision upon changes in conditions, and the change which had occurred since the hearings was catastrophic. To refuse to reopen the hearing under those circumstances was held to be an abuse of discretion. In the case at bar no controlling change of condition was alleged. There was not even a claim of newly discovered evidece. The Atchison Case rests upon its exceptional facts. It is apparently the only instance in which this Court has interfered with the exercise of the Commission's discretion in granting, or refusing, to reopen a hearing. Compare United States v. Northern Pacific R. Co., \n288 U.S. 490\n, 492 et seq ., 53 S.Ct. 406; Illinois Commerce Commission v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 474, 480\n, 481 S., 54 S.Ct. 783; St. Joseph Stock Yards Company v. United States \n298 \nU.S. 38\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 80 L.Ed . --, decided April 27, 1936.\n Fifth. Thus, the divisions-order is free of inherent error. Paragraph 4 of section 1 (49 U.S.C.A.  1(4) imposes upon the Commission the duty of establishing 'just, reasonable, and equitable divisions' (of through rates) 'which shall not unduly prefer or prejudice any of such participating carriers.' As the Court says, the purpose of Congress is 'to empower and require the commission to make divisions that colloquially may be said to be fair.' It adds: 'When made in accordance with the act, the commission's orders prescribing divisions are the equivalent of Acts of Congress requiring the carriers to serve for the amounts \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 390]\n\u00a0\n specified. ... They command service and for that purpose expropriate the use of carriers' property. If when made the prescribed divisions are or later shall become less than just compensation, the carriers may not be required to serve therefor. And, if after appropriate effort they fail to obtain divisions ... that do constitute just compensation for their services including the use of their properties, the carriers may by suit in equity have the order prescribing, or requiring to be kept in force, the challenged divisions adjudged void and its enforcement permanently enjoined.'\n That additional statement is, in my opinion, without support in any act of Congress. No law gives to a divisions-order any greater, or other, effect than that expressed in its words. The divisions-order, which alone is here under review, contains no command that the 'carriers serve for the amounts specified.' Nor does it 'command service' at all. It merely directs 'that said complainants, cross-complainants, defendants and respondents, according as they participate in the transportation be, and they are hereby notified and required to cease and desist, on and after November 1, 1933, and thereafter to abstain from asking, demanding, collecting or receiving, divisions of said joint rates upon other bases than those prescribed.'\n The only command to serve is contained in the rate-order not here under review.\n The Court states further: 'Prescribing of divisions is a legislative function.' It would be more accurate to say that the task imposed by section 15(6) is a judicial, or quasi judicial function, incident to the legislative process of rate regulation. Depsite the doctrine of the separation of powers, the Commission, like other governmental bodies, exercised certain administrative and judicial, as well as legislative functions. Many of its administrative or judicial orders may affect the earnings and net income \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 391]\n\u00a0\n of the carriers, and thus affect indirectly the adequacy of existing rates; but they are, in no sense, rate-orders.\n Prominent among determinations judicial in their nature are those under section 3 (49 U.S.C.A.  3) whether allowances made to one shipper for the use of his facilities, or for services, are, as between him and competing shippers, fair, or whether they constitute preferential treatment; determination under paragraph 15 of section 1 (49 U.S.C.A.  1( 15), of the fair amount payable by one carrier to another for the use of termin ls or equipment or for services rendered; determinations under paragraph 12 of section 1 (49 U.S.C.A.  1(12), whether distribution made of coal cars among shippers is just and reasonable; determinations under the Valuation Act of March 1, 1913, c. 92, 37 Stat. 701 (49 U.S.C.A.  19a ), of the fair value of railroad properties. Among the administrative functions is that of determining under the Safety Appliance and Boiler Inspection Acts (45 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.;  22 et seq.), what changes in equipment are required in order to insure safety; under paragraphs 4 and 9 of section 1 (49 U.S.C.A.  1(4, 9), what additional facilities and equipment are required to insure adequate transportation service; under paragraphs 2 to 10 of section 1 (49 U.S.C.A.  1 (2-10), whether a carrier should be permitted to issue securities or assume financial obligations, and if so, on what terms; under paragraphs 18 to 22 (49 U.S.C. A.  1 (18-22), whether a carrier should be permitted to construct, acquire, or control an additional line, or to abandon the whole, or any part of, one existing.\n In such judicial or administrative determinations it might conceivably be contended that expenditures ordered would so reduce net earnings as to render noncompensatory some existing prescribed rates. But the contention would not convert the proceeding into a rate-case. If the claim that by reason of the expenditure ordered, prescribed rates would cease to be compensatory proved to be well-founded, the appropriate remedy would be to seek a modification of the rate-order which had thus become confiscatory, not to set aside the ad- \n\n[298 U.S. 349, 392]\n\u00a0\n ministrative or judicial order which inherently was, and remained, free of error.\n Sixth. The question discussed is not one of merely procedural importance. To permit inquiry into the question of confiscation under the procedure here pursued might affect seriously the substantive rights of other participating carriers. As the divisions-order merely allots the share of each in existing rates, any addition to the share given to one must necessarily be taken from the share of others. For aught that appears, the share of the southern carriers received, or insisted upon, is no more than a compensatory return. If the Court had in this case concluded that the share allotted to the northern carriers was noncompensatory, and pursuant to its action their share were increased, the result might be to make the share of the southern carriers noncompensatory.\n In passing upon the issue of confiscation, the Court discussed the question, whether the trial court properly admitted evidence which had not been introduced before the Commission; and decided that the evidence was admissible. I do not agree with the Court's conclusion on that subject. But as the issue of 'confiscation' was, in my opinion, not properly before the trial court, I refrain from discussing the question what evidence would have been admissible if that issue had been.

STATE TAX COMMISSION OF MD.(1936)\nNo. 283\nArgued: January 10, 1936Decided: February 3, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 209, 210]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin F. A. Morgan and Gaylord Lee Clark, both of Baltimore, Md., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Herbert R. O'Conor and William L. Henderson, both of Baltimore, Md., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the single question whether shares in a national bank, subscribed for and owned by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, may be taxed by a state.\n The Baltimore Trust Company closed its doors in February, 1933, and was unable to reopen. It was reorganized in August of the same year as a national banking association under the name of the Baltimore National Bank with a place of business in Baltimore, Md. To set the business going, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation subscribed for the entire issue of preferred stock, 10,000 shares of the par value of $1,000,000. Following a provision of the Maryland Code (1935 Supp. art. 81,  15(e),1 the state tax commission upheld a tax upon the shares, overruling thereby the protest of the \n\n[297 U.S. 209, 211]\n\u00a0\n bank, which made a claim of immunity under the Federal Constitution for the benefit of the shareholder as well as for itself. The order made by the commission was reviewed upon appeal by the circuit court of Baltimore City, which canceled the assessment. In accord is a ruling of a District Court of the United States for the Western District of Kentucky. United States v. Lewis, 10 F.Supp. 471. Upon an appeal by the commission to the Court of Appeals of Maryland, the order of the circuit court was reversed and the assessment reinstated. 180 A. 260. To settle an important question as to the taxing power of a state, a writ of certiorari issued from this court (\n296 \nU.S. 538\n, 56 S.Ct. 125).\n The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was organized in 1932 to give relief to financial institutions in a national emergency and for other and kindred ends. Act of January 22, 1932, 47 Stat. 5, Act of July 21, 1932, 47 Stat. 709, 15 U.S.C. c. 14 (see 15 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq.). At the time of its creation and continuously thereafter the United States has been and is the sole owner of its shares. The purpose that it has aimed to serve is not profit to the government, though profit may at times result from one or more of its activities. The purpose to be served is the rehabilitation of finance and industry and commerce, threatened with prostration as the result of the great depression. We assume, though without deciding even by indirection, that within McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, a corporation so conceived and operated is an instrumentality of government without distinction in that regard between one activity and another. Even on that assumption taxation by state or municipality may overpass the usual limits \n\n[297 U.S. 209, 212]\n\u00a0\n if the consent of the United States has removed the barriers or lowered them.\n We think consent has been so given where shares in a national bank are the property to be taxed, though an agency of government is the owner of the assets subjected to the burden. By section 5219 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (12 U.S.C.  548 (12 U.S.C.A.  548); cf. Act of June 3, 1864,  41, 13 Stat. 99, 112, Act of February 10, 1868, 15 Stat. 34), 'all' the shares of a national banking association whose principal place of business is within the limits of a state are made subject to taxation at the pleasure of the Legislature with conditions as to form and method not important at this time. This Court has held that Congress in saying 'all' meant exactly what it said, and that shares in a national bank belonging to another national bank were taxable to the same extent as if they belonged to any one else. National Bank of Redemption v. Boston, \n125 \nU.S. 60, 69\n, 70 S., 8 S.Ct. 772; Bank of California v. Richardson, \n248 \nU.S. 476, 483\n, 39 S.Ct. 165; Bank of California v. Roberts, \n248 \nU.S. 497\n, 39 S.Ct. 171; Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103\n, 44 S.Ct. 23. 'The manifest intention of the law is to permit the state in which a national bank is located to tax, subject to the limitations prescribed, all the shares of its capital stock without regard to their ownership.' Nat. Bank of Redemption v. Boston, supra, \n125 U.S. 60\n, at page 70, 8 S.Ct. 772, 777. True, as we have assumed, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is a governmental agency, but so also is a national bank. McCulloch v. Maryland, supra. The question thus reduces itself to this, whether there is sufficient reason to believe that immunity from axes of this kind has been given to the one agency, though by long accepted decisions it has been denied to the other.\n In such a situation the burden is heavily on the suitor who would subject the word 'all' with its uncompromising generality to an unexpressed exception. The petitioner reminds us that the ends to be served by the \n\n[297 U.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n Reconstruction Finance Corporation are even more predominantly public than those of a national bank, since the bank, while promoting the fiscal needs of the government, is acting at the same time for the profit of its stockholders. The suggestion has its force, but force inadequate, we think, to carry to the goal. Its inadequacy is the more apparent when the capacity of the corporation to become a subscriber to the stock is followed to the sources. Until March, 1933, there was no power on the part of national banks to issue preferred shares. Act of March 9, 1933, title 3 ,  301, 48 Stat. 5, amended June 15, 1933,  1(a), 48 Stat. 147, 12 U.S.C .  51(a) (see 12 U.S.C.A.  51a). Until then there was no power on the part of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to subscribe for such shares or indeed for any others. Act of March 9, 1933, title 3,  304, 48 Stat. 5, 6, amended March 24, 1933,  2, 48 Stat. 20, 21, 12 U.S.C.  51(d ), 12 U.S.C.A.  51d. By statutes then enacted a national bank was authorized to issue preferred shares of one or more classes upon the approval first obtained of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was authorized at the same time, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to subscribe for preferred shares in national banks and also in state banks and trust companies that were in need of funds for capital purposes, subject to the proviso that no such subscription was to be permitted unless the holders of the preferred shares were exempt from double liability. This proviso in and of itself is highly significant of the understanding of the Congress that upon the acceptance of the shares the corporation would be exposed to the same measure of liability and would stand in the same position as shareholders in general.\n Other signposts of intention seem to point us the same way, though perhaps with less directness. The newly created power to issue preferred shares was given by an act for the governance of banks (48 Stat. 5), now incor- \n\n[297 U.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n porated in the United States Code as part of title 12, regulating banks and banking. 12 U.S.C.  51(a) (12 U.S.C.A.  51a). The newly created power to subscribe for preferred shares was given by the same act. 48 Stat. 5, 6, amended March 24, 1933,  2, 48 Stat. 20, 21, 12 U.S.C.,  51(d), 12 U.S.C.A.  51d. The two are incidents and aspects of a unitary scheme. No one will deny that shares put out under this act would have been taxable to the holders in the event that some one other than this particular corporation had acquired the new issue through purchase or subscription. If they were to be exempt in the hands of a particular corporation, empowered to acquire them by an associated section, then was the appropriate time for announcing the exception. Instead there is a clear assumption, brought out into full relief by the exclusion of shares chargeable with double liability, that subscriptions when permitted are to stand on an equality, irrespective of their source. A shareholder in the banking system is a shareholder for every purpose, accepting the attendant liabilities along with the attendant powers.\n We have reserved to the last an argument strongly pressed in behalf of the petitioner, but one more easily appraised in the light of what has gone before. The act for the formation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has its own provisions for exemption, which have now to be considered. 'The corporation, including its franchise, its capital, reserves, and surplus, and its income shall be exempt from all taxation ... except that any real property of the corporation shall be subject to ... taxation to the same exte t according to its value as other real property is taxed.' 47 Stat. 5, 9, 10,  10, 15 U.S.C.  610 (15 U.S.C.A.  610).2 The petitioner insists that the tax now in controversy is forbidden by that section. The contention is plausible, yet it will not prevail against analysis. For \n\n[297 U.S. 209, 215]\n\u00a0\n the tax now in controversy, whatever its indirect effect, is not laid directly upon the capital, reserves, or surplus of the corporation claiming the immunity or accorded the exemption. It is laid upon the shares in another corporation, a member of the banking system, which must pay it in the first place (Maryland Code, 1935 Supp. art. 81,  15(e); Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 518\n, 27 S.Ct. 571), though with a right to be made whole thereafter. 'Capital, reserves and surplus' are not taxable by a state if they belong to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Neither are they taxable if they belong to a national bank. First National Bank of Gulfport, Mississippi v. Adams, \n258 \nU.S. 362\n, 42 S.Ct. 323; Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Fairweather, supra, \n263 U.S. 103\n, at pages 106, 107, 44 S.Ct. 23; Domenech v. National City Bank, \n294 \nU.S. 199, 204\n, 55 S.Ct. 366. This has not been thought to exclude the taxation of such a bank upon its shares in other banks, members of the federal system. National Bank of Redemption v. Boston, supra; Bank of California v. Richardson, supra; Bank of California v. Roberts, supra; Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, supra. With hardly more reason may words of like extension have a broader meaning here. An earlier act, specific in its coverage, will be read as an exception to a later one directed to investments generally. 'It is a well-settled principle of construction that specific terms covering the given subject-matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.' Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 125\n, 24 S.Ct. 797, 803, 1 Ann.Cas. 655; cf. Ginsberg & Sons v.

All shares in national banks-no matter by whom owned-shall be subject to taxation. R.S.  5219, as amended (12 U.S.C.A.  548). Across the petitioner's path there still lies the stumbling block of that uncompromising 'all.'\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Shares of stock assessable under this section shall be taxed to the several owners thereof, and the taxes thereon shall be debts of such owners, but may be collected in each case from the bank or other corporation, which shall be bound to pay the same for account of its stockholders whether or not dividends are declared thereon, as if such corporations were the ultimate taxpayer, but may obtain reimbursement therefor from the respective stockholders, and may charge the same in reduction of any amounts due to the several shareholders as dividends or otherwise.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The real property of national banks is subject to a like exception.

SHEPPARD(1936)\nNo. 10\nArgued: October 13, 1936Decided: November 9, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Court of Civil Appeals, Third Supreme Judicial District, State of Texas.\n * Rehearing denied \n299 \nU.S. 622\n, 57 S.Ct. 229, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n[299 U.S. 33, 34]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. R. Watkins, of Fort Worth, Tex., for appellants.\n Messrs. Wm. McCrew, Atty. Gen., and Scott Gaines, Llewellyn Duke and H. Grady Chandler, all of Austin, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of the State of Texas imposing a tax on the production of oil is here challenged as violating the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States and the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The appellants own lands from which oil is produced under a lease given in 1925. The lease is in the usual form of an oil lease; invests the lessee with the right to explore for and produce oil; shows that the production is to be for the mutual benefit of the lessor and lessee; \n\n[299 U.S. 33, 35]\n\u00a0\n fixes the lessor's proportion, or royalty interest, at 'the equal 1\/8 part of all oil produced'; and requires the lessee to deliver that proportion to the lessor's credit, 'free of cost, in the pipe line' to which the wells are connected.\n When the lease was given and up to 1933 a law of the State imposed on the lessee alone, as the active producer, a tax on all oil produced,1 and that tax was paid and borne by the lessee so long as that law remained in force.\n By an act of 19332 a substituted tax on oil production was imposed with an accompanying provision that the tax 'shall be borne ratably by all interested parties including royalty interests' and with other provisions designed to secure prompt and certain payment of the full tax as by charging the active producer, or the purchaser of the oil where sold in the pipe line, with a primary duty to pay the full tax, and authorizing and requiring him to withhold from royalty or purchase money due interested parties the proportionate tax due from them. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n For about a year after the act of 1933 became effective the purchaser of the oil produced under the lease paid the full tax and deducted the appellants' proportion from what was due to them on the purchase of their share of the oil. The payment of this part of the tax was accompanied by written protests of the appellants and the purchaser. \n\n[299 U.S. 33, 36]\n\u00a0\n The present suit was brought by the appellants against the Comptroller and Treasurer of the State to secure a refund of the taxes paid under protest and an injunction against the collection of further taxes in respect to appellants' interest in the production. In the court of first instance there was a decree for the defendants, which the Court of Civil Appeals affirmed after sustaining the taxing act against appellants' before mentioned challenge to its validity. 4 The Supreme Court of the State declined to take the case on writ of error, and an appeal to this Court was sought and allowed.\n We come first to the contention that, as applied to the appellants, who are not actively engaged in the production of oil but are lessors having a royalty interest, the act is an arbitrary fiat, in contravention of fundamental principles of private right and distributive justice, and therefore denies to appellants the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The taxing act calls the tax an 'occupation tax' and a 'gross production tax.' The Court of Civil Appeals applies to it both of these designations, and also characterizes it as a 'tax levied on the business or occupation of producing oil.' In discussing appellants' claim that they are not engaged in such a business or occupation and that the act nevertheless includes them among those on whom the tax is laid, the court expresses the view that, for the purposes of such a tax, 'the legislature may validly declare the owners of royalty or other interests in the oil produced to be engaged in the occupation or business of producing oil.' The designations applied to the tax and the view just noticed are stressed by counsel for the appellants and relied upon as supporting the contention that the taxing act is essentially an arbitrary fiat.\n But when mere characterizations of the tax are put aside and attention is given to the substance of the court's \n\n[299 U.S. 33, 37]\n\u00a0\n opinions in this and a companion case, 5 it unmistakably appears that the court regarded the tax as an excise laid on the production of oil, measured by the extent of the production, and charged ratably against all who have an interest in the oil produced. True, the court speaks of the tax as laid on the 'occupation or business' of producing oil, but its opinions plainly show that these terms are used in the sense of a 'planned undertaking' or 'mining venture' and as comprehending all who have a direct and beneficial interest in the oil being produced, whether they be owners conducting oil operations on their own lands, or lessees operating under leases from owners and sharing the oil with the latter, or owners who have leased their lands for oil operations and share the oil with the lessees. As illustrating the actual decision and the reasons underlying it we quote from the opinions:\n'The legislative intent to levy the tax ratably against all interested parties in the oil produced is also clearly evidenced by the language that 'the purchaser of oil shall pay the tax on all oil purchased and deduct tax so paid from payment due producer or other interest holder,' and 'withhold from any payment due interested parties, the proportionate tax due.' Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. art. 7057a,  2, subds. 3, 6. These provisions do not levy the tax against the purchaser. He is merely made the agent of the state to collect from the producer or other interest holders the total amount of the tax due; and he is authorized to charge their respective accounts with 'the proportionate tax due.' That is, the purchaser withholds from the producer only as an interest holder and only to the extent of his interest. Likewise the purchaser withholds from other royalty or interest holders the amount of the tax due on their royalty or other interests. The act, therefore, designates the parties against whom the tax is levied. The amount of the tax due by \n\n[299 U.S. 33, 38]\n\u00a0\n each is also defined or measured by the extent of interest in the oil produced, or the amount paid because it was produced. ...\n\n'It is also manifest that the tax is not dependent upon the character of title under which the producer produces the oil. Nor is the tax levied on the oil in place. The tax is levied on the business or occupation of producing the oil. ...\n\n'The ordinary form of oil lease has a dual character or purpose: (1) The conveyance of an estate in the land for development purposes; and (2) the future development and operation of the lease for oil in accordance with the terms, express and implied, of the contract for the mutual benefit of the parties, their respective benefit being measured by the extent of their interests in the oil produced, or its value. The law is settled that the primary objective or purpose of the oil lease is the production of oil for the mutual profit of the parties. The consideration moving to the lessor is an interest in the oil or its value in money. Thus he has a direct interest in the success of the business. As the holder of the royalty interest the lessor or royalty owner is not only entitled to share in the gross production of the oil, but may under the terms of the lease, expressed or implied, require proper, prudent, and diligent management and development of the business, and has reserved and is entitled to both legal and equitable remedies necessary to enforce the obligations of the lease, and under some circumstances may forfeit the lease for nondevelopment.'\n\n And the court quoted the following from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Mexico:6 \n\n[299 U.S. 33, 39]\n\u00a0\n 'Our minds do not reject the idea that the lessee and the royalty owner, considered as participating in a joint enterprise, are both engaged in the business of producing or severing oil, and that the tax is therefore essentially occupational. Such a view, however, is not indispensable to sustaining the tax. For it may be considered occupational as to the lessee and another kind of tax as to the royalty owner. Unless found, as to one or the other, to be a tax upon tangible property, it need not be levied ad valorem, and is an excise.'\n In view of this exposition of the purpose and meaning of the act, we are of opinion that it is not an arbitrary fiat and does not infringe the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n While operations under the lease are carried on by the lessee and not by the lessors, they nevertheless are carried on in virtue of the lease, that is to say, under stipulations made between the lessors and the lessee. The lease shows that the parties to it are, in a very practical sense, committed to and engaged in a common venture for their mutual benefit. The lessors have put into the venture their right to explore for and to extract the oil under their lands, and the lessee has put into it various drilling and pumping appliances and much expense, labor, and time. All that has been put in is devoted to the common purpose of producing oil in which the lessors and the lessee are to have stated interests. It is this production that is taxed against the lessors and the lessee according to their respective interests.\n Without question the State has power to lay an excise on the production of oil. Here it is laid, admissibly we think, on those having a direct and beneficial interest in the oil produced and is apportioned between them according to their interests. The apportionment is reasonable, not arbitrary; and is as reasonable to the lessors as to the lessee. \n\n[299 U.S. 33, 40]\n\u00a0\n We come next to the contention that the act, in so far as it imposes the tax on the appellants, impairs the obligation of their contract with the lessee whereby he agrees to deliver to their credit, 'free of cost,' in the pipe line, the equal 1\/8 part of the oil produced. The lease contains no mention of taxes or of their payment. It well may be that when rightly construed, the engagement to deliver, free of cost, refers to expenses incurred in producing the oil and conducting it to the pipe line, and is not intended to include governmental exactions, such as a tax. This would appear to be an admissible if not a necessary construction of that engagement. But, be this as it may, the lease was made in subordination to the power of the State to tax the production of oil and to apportion the tax between the lessors and the lessee. The taxing act does not purport to reach or affect any term of the lease. Plainly no stipulation in the lease can be of any avail as against the power of the State to impose the tax, prescribe who shall be under a duty to the State to pay it, and fix the time and mode of payment. And this is true even though it be assumed to be admissible for the lessors and lessee to stipulate as to who, as between themselves, shall ultimately bear the tax. These views are but a reiteration and application of what repeatedly has been held in respect of contracts and their subordination to the taxing power. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that the law in force when the lease was made and for some years thereafter laid a production tax on the lessee alone, and it is equally true that under the act \n\n[299 U.S. 33, 41]\n\u00a0\n of 1933 a part of the tax is imposed on the lessors and the part imposed on the lessee is less than what would fall on him under the earlier law. But the State's power in the matter was in no way circumscribed by the earlier law. That law was subject to change at any time through a further exertion of the taxing power; and the lease presented no obstacle to such a change.\n It follows that appellants' reliance on the contract clause of the Constitution is ill-grounded.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 7071. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act 1933, Reg.Sess., c. 162,  2, as amended by Act 1933, 1st Called Sess., c. 12,  1 (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 7057a,  2). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 2(3) provides: 'The purchaser of oil shall pay the tax on all oil purchased and deduct tax so paid from payment due producer or other interest holder.'\n And section 2(6) further provides: 'The tax herein levied shall be borne ratably by all interested parties, including royalty interests; and producers and\/or purchaser of oil are hereby authorized and required to withhold from any payment due interested parties, the proportionate tax due.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 89 S.W.(2d) 1026, 1027. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Group No. 1 Oil Corporation v.

Ct. 833; \n295 \nU.S. 726\n, 55 S.Ct. 835) to resolve conflicts with respect to the scope and alleged infringement of claims 1 to 6, 8, 10, 14, and 15 of the Gullborg patent, No. 1,307,734. In No. 23 the Circuit Court of Appeals, while holding the claims valid, so construed them as to exculpate the accused devices from the charge of contributory infringement. \n1\n In No. 31 the Circuit Court of Appeals gave the claims a broader construction and adjudged that the petitioners were guilty of contributory infringement. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The subject of the patent is a device for lubricating metal bearings, particularly those of automobiles. It has occasioned much litigation. \n3\n Before the date of Gull- \n\n[298 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n borg's invention grease cups were used for bearing lubrication. The cup was connected with the bearing by a tube and oil or grease was forced through the tube into the bearing by screwing down a cap or plunger which was part of the cup. It became common to substitute, in place of the grease cup, a tubular fitting and to force grease through the fitting by means of a 'gun' consisting of a compression chamber and an attached hose, the latter coupled to the fitting by a screw thread or bayonet coupling. In the case of the bayonet coupler the fitting had lugs or pins and the coupler device had slots which engaged such lugs or pins to form a tight union. The grease would then be forced from the chamber of the gun into the bearing by the use of a plunger or pump. In some of the prior art appliances the aperture of the fitting was kept closed when greasing was not being done by a ball or capsule held against the opening of the fitting by a spring. This closure is opened, during the greasing operation, by the pressure of the grease. Gullborg conceived the idea of a fitting in which, instead of pins or lugs set on either side, there should be a pin running directly through the tube and extending out on either side. He used that portion of the pin which bisected the tube as the base of a spring to hold in place a metal ball which closed the aperture of the fitting. This invention was novel in the respect that while others \n\n[298 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n had similarly closed the aperture of the fitting none had employed the pin both to form the lugs for engaging the slots of the coupler and to form the base of the spring supporting the ball closure. For this invention he applied for and obtained a patent, No. 1,307,733, which is not here in suit. Recognizing that when a bayonet coupler is secured to the pin fitting, and the grease is forced through the fitting into the bearing under great pressure, upon uncoupling the gun from the fitting some grease will remain around the end of the fitting and the orifice of the coupler which is not only useless but likely to soil the clothing of the operator or others using the machine, and litter the place where the greasing is done, Gullborg set about to devise a means for eliminating this residuum of grease. He conceived the idea of placing a movable perforated cup- shaped disk or washer in the barrel of the coupler held by a spring against the orifice of the coupler. The intended operation of his device was that when the coupler had been fastened over the pin fitting the spring should press the washer against the ball in the pin fitting so that the tube in the fitting would be open to receive the grease and, upon aplication of pressure to the grease, the washer would thereby be firmly pressed against the opening of the pin fitting, thus causing a tight union and preventing exudation of grease. His specif cation asserts that the invention makes possible the injection of grease under very high pressure. The design of the bayonet slots is such that, in uncoupling, the coupling member of the gun will at first be moved slightly forward on the pin fitting thus backing up the perforated washer in the bore of the coupler. As the two parts are then drawn apart by the retraction of the coupler, the cup-shaped washer will be forced forward by the spring. This will cause a vacuum behind the washer and the air rushing in through the \n\n[298 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n perforation in the washer will draw with it any grease which would otherwise adhere about the orifices of the fitting and the coupling.\n While Gullborg's invention was confined to an improvement in the hose coupler, which is but one element in the old and well understood combination of a compression chamber or pump, a hose, a hose-coupler, and a grease cup or fitting connected to the bearing to be lubricated, his claims are not for the improvement as such but all are for a combination of the old elements with the improved form of coupler. They are too long to set forth in full. Claim 2 may be taken as typical of a number of them. It reads:\n'2. The combination with a hollow coupling member having a pin projecting from one side thereof and a spring-pressed closure, of a pump, a discharge conduit having one end secured to the outlet of said pump, a second hollow coupling member for receiving the closed end of said first named coupling member secured to the other end of said conduit and provided with a bayonet slot adapted to co-act with said pin, a perforated sealing disk mounted to reciprocate in the bore of said coupling member, means for yieldingly urging said sealing disk against the closed end of said first named coupling member, and means for limiting the movement of said sealing disk in the direction of said second coupling member.'\n\n The claimed combination is, therefore, of four things: (1) A type of pin fitting which was old in the art; (2) a pump for creating pressure, which was old; (3) a hose to connect the two; and (4) a well-known type of coupler, the only novel feature of which is the perforated sealing disk mounted to reciprocate in the bore of the coupler with means for yieldingly pressing the disk against the end of the pin fitting and means for limiting the movement of the disk in the direction of the pin fitting ( which \n\n[298 U.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n signifies merely some sort of shoulder at the orifice of the coupler to prevent the spring from forcing the disk out of the end of the bore).\n Nothing is said in specification or claims concerning the release of the high pressure in the gun before uncoupling, but evidently this must be done if the movement of the perforated disk is to create a vacuum. The petitioner concedes that if the high pressure is maintained the grease packed behind the washer will move forward with it and not only prevent the creation of a vacuum back of the washer but continue to exude from the coupler through the perforation in the washer. It is explained that the pressure may be released by a slight retraction of the pl nger in the grease gun so as to permit the spring and washer to perform their function of creating a suction when the pin and coupler are disengaged.\n Claims 1 to 6, inclusive, and 8 and 10, have been repeatedly held valid, but the invention has generally been limited to the novel means whereby upon the uncoupling of the gun from the pin fitting a suction is produced which removes excess lubricant from the point of contact of the two members. Although in the instant cases the validity of the claims is denied, we think they disclose novelty and invention to the extent indicated.\n Claims 14 and 15 are of a different order. Claim 15 may be taken as typical. It is:\n'15. The combination with a grease cup comprising a tubular member having a closure seat, a closure, a pin extending through said tubular member and from both sides thereof, and a spring confined between said pin and closure, and tending to hold said closure on its seat, of a grease pump having a discharge conduit, and means co-acting with the ends of said pin for detachably connecting the discharge end of said conduit with said grease cup.'\n\n It will be noted that this claim describes a combination consisting of the pin fitting of Gullborg's patent \n\n[298 U.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n No. 1,307,733, with any grease pump having a bayonet type coupler. Nothing in the claim discloses the cup shaped reciprocating disk yieldingly pressed forward against the closure of the pin fitting. Grease guns having such a bayonet coupling were old in the art. The question is whether claims 14 and 15, unless restricted to the combination of a grease gun and coupler and a pin fitting such as are described in the specifications of the patent, are void as attempting to extend the monopoly of Gullborg's patent No. 1,307,733, to exclude the use therewith of any grease gun except one having the suction device of the patent in suit.\n With this background we pass to consideration of the specific cases presented. \n No. 23.\n\n The petitioner, as owner of the Gullborg patent, filed a bill in the district court to restrain alleged infringement by the respondent. The latter did not sell pin fitings but did sell two types of grease pumps. The slotted coupler of the first has no slidably mounted cup-shaped perforated disk in its bore. Confessedly there is no means for producing the suction effect claimed for Gullborg's invention. The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the decision of the district court, held that in view of the limited scope of the invention disclosed in claims 1 to 6, inclusive, and 8 and 10, this device did not infringe. It further decided that as claims 14 and 15 must be limited to a combination embracing couplers embodying the suction effect-the only novel feature of the patent- or else be held void as attempting to gain protection for something not covered by the invention, this grease pump did not infringe those claims. The petitioner does not contest the holdings. The second gun sold by the respondent combines a receptacle containing grease under a pneumatic pressure of about one hundred pounds, the \n\n[298 U.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n exit of which is connected to a pipe discharging into the chamber of a plunger-operated pump and a hose attached at the base of the pump chamber terminating in a coupling device like that of the Gullborg patent. The method of operation is that when the plunger is retracted beyond the orifice of the supply pipe grease is forced into the pump chamber by the air pressure in the receptacle. By the downward stroke of the plunger the entrance to the pump-chamber is closed and the grease therein forced into the hose and through the coupling and pin fitting to the bearing. By successive strokes a very high pressure can be built up in the hose. The Circuit Court of Appeals found, and we think correctly, that with this arrangement it was impossible to release the pressure in the grease line between the pump and the bearing before uncoupling the hose from the pin fitting, so as to permit the spring to force the disk forward in the bore of the oupler and create a suction as in Gullborg's patent; and that the accused device was subject to the very exudation of grease at the point of union which Gullborg's invention was intended to obviate. It therefore held that the accused grease gun lacked the only novel feature of the patented combination.\n The decision went upon a question of fact. The petitioner offered no evidence to prove that the accused device operated to produce the suction effect claimed in the patent but relied upon the physical exhibits consisting of its own and the respondent's apparatus and upon ocular demonstrations of their operation. The respondent introduced evidence to show the absence of the suction effect in its device and combatted the inference sought to be drawn from the physical operation of the two exhibits. We are satisfied that the Circuit Court of Appeals was correct in its decision that the accused device did not embody the novel feature claimed in the patent. \n\n[298 U.S. 415, 423]\n\u00a0\n As respects claims 14 and 15, which are for a combination of the pin fitting covered by Gullborg's patent No. 1,307,733 with a grease gun and coupler of any type, the Court of Appeals held that these must be read as claiming a combination of the patented pin fitting and a gun with the coupling device described in the specifications and having the suction effect set forth in the other claims or must be held void as unlawful attempts to extend the monopoly of the pin fitting which is described in patent 1,307,733. The court sustained these claims by restricting their scope to conform to the other claims based on the suction effect and held they were not infringed by the respondent's apparatus. We do not understand the petitioner to seek a reversal of this holding. Its petition for certiorari and the assignments of error are bare of any attack upon this portion of the Circuit Court of Appeals' decision. These claims, however, are drawn in question in No. 31 and may more properly be discussed in that connection.\n No. 31.\n In this case the respondent, as owner of the Gullborg patent No. 1, 307,734, sued the petitioners, who neither made nor sold pin fittings of the type covered by Gullborg's patent No. 1,307,733, nor grease pumps or guns having the coupler construction of those described and claimed in the patent in suit. But the petitioners did sell pin fittings of a type with which a grease gun of the description of Gullborg's could be used, and grease guns having a bayonet slotted coupler, which could be used either with the pin fittings of Gullborg's patent No. 1,307,733 or with others not covered thereby. These sales were charged to be contributory infringements of patent No. 1,307,734. The District Court so held (5 F. Supp. 940) and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\n What has been said with respect to claims 14 and 15 need not be repeated. The petitioners' grease guns are \n\n[298 U.S. 415, 424]\n\u00a0\n of an old unpatented type having couplers of a different construction from that disclosed in the patent. There is no assertion that they produce the suction effect of Gullborg's invention. The petitioners' pin fittings are not of the type described in Gullborg's patent No. 1,307,733.\n The proofs establish that the prior art embraced the use in combination of a grease gun composed of a chamber or pump, a hose, a hose- coupler, and a spring-closed fitting, the coupling being of the pin and slot or bayonet type. The respondent's position is, nevertheless, that if the petitioners furnish a gun, a part of this old unpatented and unpatentable combination, for use with the patented pin fitting of Gullborg's No. 1,307,733, they contributorily infringe claims 14 and 15 of the patent in suit because those claims describe the combination of any grease gun with the patented pin fittings. Again, the respondent says that as pin fittings made in accordance with the prior art, but susceptible of use with a gun covered by the patent in suit, were sold by petitioners, these sales constituted contributory infringements of all the claims of he patent.\n It is plain that Gullborg invented improvements of two of the mechanical elements of an old combination consisting of grease pump, hose, hose-coupler, and a grease cup or pin fitting. First, he contrived an improved pin fitting. This he patented as such. No. 1,307,733. Secondly, he invented an improved form of coupler to be attached to the end of the hose leading from the pump to the fitting. Instead of patenting this, as he did the pin fitting, he claimed a combination of pump, hose-coupler, and pin fitting, and embodied in the combination his improved form of coupler. No. 1,307,734, the patent in suit; claims 1-6, 8, and 10. He further claimed the combination between his patented pin fitting and any form of grease gun whether that \n\n[298 U.S. 415, 425]\n\u00a0\n claimed in his patent or unpatented and old in the art. Claims 14 and 15. The question then is whether, by this method, the patentee, by improving one element of an old combination whose construction and operating is otherwise unchanged, may, in effect, repatent the old combination by reclaiming it with the improved element substituted for the old element. That this cannot be done is known by numerous cases in this and other federal courts. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n213 \nU.S. 301, 325\n, 29 S.Ct. 495, on which the respondent relies, is not in point. There the patent was a pioneer patent and the combination was of elements which were novel and neither of which possessed utility without the other. Each element was necessary to the operation of the other. The invention did not, as here, consist of the mere improvement of one element of an old combination.\n We are of the opinion that the owner of the patents cannot extend the monopoly of its patent for a pin fitting to preclude the use therewith of any grease gun not embodying the improvement in the coupling device evidenced by the patent in suit; and cannot extend the monopoly of the combination patent in suit to prevent the use of a pin fitting which does not infringe the fitting patent, 1,307,733, with a gun having a coupler such as that claimed in the patent in suit. \n\n[298 U.S. 415, 426]\n\u00a0\n In No. 23 the decree is affirmed. In No. 31 the decree is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Hollingshead Co. v.

GENTRY(1936)\n\nArgued: February 12, 1936Decided: March 2, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of California. \n\n[297 U.S. 422, 423]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter Slack and Roy Daily, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\n Mr. Darwin Bryan, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought to enjoin appellees, officers of the state of California, from enforcing certain provisions of the State Fish and Game Code (Statutes 1933, pp. 394, 484 et seq.) alleged to contravene the commerce clause, and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the Federal Constitution. The court below sustained a motion to dismiss the bill, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action or to entitle appellant to any relief by injunction or otherwise. 8 F.Supp. 67. We are of opinion that this decree must be affirmed.\n Appellant is a California corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing, from the meat of sardines, fish flour for human consumption. the sardines are caught by fishermen upon the high seas beyond the three- mile limit to which the jurisdiction of the state extends, sold to appellant, and brought into the state and there reduced to fish flour at appellant's reduction plants. The Fish flour is made with the expectation of selling \n\n[297 U.S. 422, 424]\n\u00a0\n and shipping it in interstate and foreign commerce; and it is so sold and shipped and is used as food in the United States and foreign countries. Sardines are a migratory fish found in great numbers in the Pacific Ocean beyond the three-mile limit as well as within that limit. So far as known, they spawn upon the open seas. In the process of reducing the fish, appellant uses a portion for producing flour for human consumption, the remainder being converted into a meal used for chicken feed, and into fertilizer, fish oil, and other nonedible substances.\n Sardines caught in the same way are also purchased by packers, who clean, cook, and can or preserve them for human food, using in that process only a part of the fish and utilizing the remainder for reduction into nonedible products.\n The provisions of the Fish and Game Code which appellees threaten to enforce against appellant and those necessary to be considered in that connection are copied in the margin. \n1\n The bill alleges that appellees will pre- \n\n[297 U.S. 422, 425]\n\u00a0\n vent appellant from manufacturing fish flour in its reduction plants while at the same time permitting packers to use sardines, taken from the waters of the state or those outside, in their packing plants.\n First. There is nothing in the state act to suggest a purpose to interfere with interstate commerce. It in no way limits or regulates or attempts to limit or regulate the \n\n[297 U.S. 422, 426]\n\u00a0\n movement of the sardines from outside into the state, or the movement of the manufactured product from the state to the outside. The act regulates only the manufacture within the state. Its direct operation, intended and actual, is wholly local. Whether the product is consumed within the borders of the state or shipped outside in interstate or foreign commerce are matters with which the act is not concerned. The plain purpose of the measure simply is to conserve for food the fish found within the waters of the state. Over these fish, and over state wild game generally, the state has supreme control. Sardines taken from waters within the jurisdiction of the state and those taken from without are, of course, indistinguishable; and to the extent that the act deals with the use or treatment of fish brought into the state from the outside, its legal justification rests upon the ground that it operates as a shield against the covert depletion of the local supply, and thus tends to effectuate the policy of the law by rendering evasion of it less easy. People of State of New York ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg, \n211 \nU.S. 31, 39\n, 40 S., 29 S.Ct. 10.\n If the enforcement of the act affects interstate or foreign commerce, that result is purely incidental, indirect, and beyond the purposes of the legislation. The provisions of the act assailed are well within the police power of the state, as frequently decided by this and other courts. It is unnecessary to do more than refer to People of State of New York ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg, supra, \n211 U.S. 31\n, 39 et seq., 29 S.Ct. 10, and Van Camp Sea Food Co. v. Department of Natural Resources (D.C.) 30 F.(2d) 111, where the decisions are collected.\n Appellant places great reliance upon Foster Packing Co. v. Haydel, \n278 \nU.S. 1\n, 49 S.Ct. 1. There an act of the state of Louisiana forbade exportation of shrimp from which the heads and hulls or shells had not been removed. The ostensible purpose of the act was to conserve the raw shells for local use. The bill and affidavits in support of it, however, demonstrated, we held, that this purpose was \n\n[297 U.S. 422, 427]\n\u00a0\n feigned, and that the real purpose was to prevent the shrimp from being moved as theretofore from Louisiana to a point in Mississippi, where they were packed or canned and sold in interstate commerce, and thus through commercial necessity to bring about the removal of the packing and canning industries from Mississippi to Louisiana. The Louisiana act authorized every part of the shrimp to be shipped and sold in interstate commerce. We held that the state might have retained the shrimp for use and consumption therein; but, having fully permitted shipment and sale outside the state, those taking the shrimp under the authority of the act became entitled to the rights of private ownership and the protection of the commerce clause. It is plain that the decision has no application to the case under review.\n Second. The point that the provisions of the Fish and Game Code deprive appellant of its property without due process of law seems to be based upon the contention that appellant is denied the right to contract for the purchase of sardines taken from the high seas and brought into the state. Assuming the point to have been properly raised below, which is by no means clear, it is without merit. Undoubtedly the right to contract, with some exceptions, is a liberty which falls within the protection of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 545\n, 546 S., 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238, and cases cited. Plainly enough, however, that right is not directly interfered with by the legislative provisions in question. Nor, because they may operate indirectly as a deterrent, do they, in the sense of the Constitution, deprive appellant of the liberty of contract. A statute does not become unconstitutional merely because it has created a condition of affairs which renders the making of a related contract, lawful in itself, ineffective.\n These provisions have a reasonable relation to the object of their enactment-namely, the conservation of the \n\n[297 U.S. 422, 428]\n\u00a0\n fish supply of the state-and we cannot invalidate them because we might think, as appellant in effect urges, that they will fail or have failed of their purpose. McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 \nU.S. 539, 547\n, 548 S., 29 S.Ct. 206. Nor can we declare the provisions void because it might seem to us that they enforce an objectionable policy or inflict hardship in particular instances Chicago, etc., Railroad v. Nebraska, \n170 \nU.S. 57, 77\n, 18 S.Ct. 513. And see, generally, Chicago, B. & Quincy R.R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549\n, 31 S.Ct. 259. 'Whether the enactment is wise or unwise,' this court said in that case (\n219 \nU.S. 549, 569\n, 31 S.Ct. 259, 263), 'whether it is based on sound economic theory, whether it is the best means to achieve the desired result, whether, in short, the legislative discretion within its prescribed limits should be exercised in a particular manner, are matters for the judgment of the legislature, and the earnest conflict of serious opinion does not suffice to bring them within the range of judicial cognizance.'\n Third. Finally, it is said that the provisions of the state Code so discriminate between the business of appellant and that of persons engaged in canning or preserving fish, as to deny appellant the equal protection of the laws. Section 1010, supra, requires a license for each plant or place of business to engage in (a) canning, curing, preserving or packing fish, etc., and (b) manufacturing fish scrap, fish meal, fish oil, chicken feed, or fertilizer from fish or fish offal. Section 1060 defines 'reduction plant' as a plant used in the reduction of fish into fish flour, fish meal, fish scrap, fertilizer, fish oil, or other fishery products or by-products; and defines 'packer' as any person canning fish or preserving fish by the common methods of drying, salting, pickling or smoking. Section 1064 is a provision intended to prevent deterioration or waste of fish, and specifically provides that, except as allowed by the Code, it shall be unlawful to use any part of the fish except the offal in a reduction plant or by a reduction process. By section 1065, \n\n[297 U.S. 422, 429]\n\u00a0\n sardines are allowed to be taken for use in a reduction plant or by a packer only in accordance with certain provisions set forth. By section 1068, the State Fish and Game Commission is authorized to grant a revocable permit 'subject to such restrictions, rules or regulations as the commission may prescribe, to take and use fish by a reduction or extraction process. No reduction of fish shall be permitted which may tend to deplete the species, or result in waste or deterioration of fish.' No similar limitation is put upon, or similar power conferred in respect of, packers; and it is the resulting classification which appellant contends contravenes the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n It never has been found possible to lay down any infallible or all- inclusive test by the application of which it may be determined whether a given difference between the subjects of legislation is enough to justify the subjection of one and not the other to a particular form of disadvantage. A very large number of decisions have dealt with the matter; and the nearest approach to a definite rule which can be extracted from them is that, while the difference need not be great, the classification must not be arbitrary or capricious, but must bear some just and reasonable relation to the object of the legislation. A particular classification is not invalidated by the Fourteenth Amendment merely because inequality actually results. Every classification of persons or things for regulation by law produces inequality in some degree; but the law is not thereby rendered invalid (Atchison, Topeka, etc., Railroad v. Matthews, \n174 \nU.S. 96, 106\n, 19 S.Ct. 609), unless the inequality produced be actually and palpably unreasonable and arbitrary. Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Comm., \n261 \nU.S. 379, 384\n, 43 S.Ct. 387, and cases cited.\n The purpose of the legislation under consideration is to prevent unnecessary waste, and to conserve for food the fish supply subject to state jurisdiction. See People \n\n[297 U.S. 422, 430]\n\u00a0\n v. Monterey Fish Products Co., 195 Cal. 548, 557-559, 234 P. 398, 38 A.L.R. 1186. If the Legislature was of the view-as evidently it was-that the process of packing on the whole would not interfere with the effectuation of this policy while the process of reduction would do so, unless carefully limited to prevent excessive operations, we are unable to perceive any reason for saying that such view was without reasonable basis. By the process of packing-that is, canning or preserving-fish, the original form of the edible portions of the fish is not destroyed as it is by the process of reduction, by which those portion are broken down into a loose meal or flour. In the latter case it is obvious that the product may be readily diverted to other purposes than human consumption, such as chicken feed, fertilizer, etc. It is equally obvious that such a diversion is not likely to happen in the case of canning or preserving, where the edible portions retain their original solid form. The state also points out that the process of reduction is simple, and the quantity which can be reduced in a given period of time greatly exceeds what can be utilized by packing, which is a much slower and more complicated process. These differences are enough to bring the classification within the permissible range of state power, so far as the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned.\n We have considered the arguments of appellant tending to a different conclusion than that which we have reached; but at most these arguments do no more than demonstrate that the question is debatable. And, if so, the effect of the action of the state Legislature in passing the statute was to decide this debatable question against the view now advanced by appellant; and since we are unable to say that such a determination by the Legislature is clearly unfounded, we are precluded from overturning it. Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 44 S.Ct. 325.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1010, p. 480.

SPENCER(1936)\nNo. 676\nArgued: Decided: April 27, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 124, 125]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harold M. Sawyer, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 124, 126]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John L. McNab, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case certiorari was granted, \n297 \nU.S. 701\n, 56 S.Ct. 573, to review a ruling of the Supreme Court of California, 48 P.(2d) 678, that assumption of risk is not a defense to a suit \n\n[298 U.S. 124, 127]\n\u00a0\n brought by a seaman under the Jones Act (Merchant Marine Act of 1920,  33) 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C.  688 (46 U.S.C.A.  688), to recover for personal injuries due to the negligent failure of the officers of the vessel to provide him with a safe place in which to work.\n Respondent was employed by petitioner as a seaman on a coasting vessel. While engaged in unloading lumber from the deck he was injured by a fall into an open hatch. On the trial there was evidence from which the jury could have found that the deck of the vessel, from the bulwarks to within about 40 inches of either side of the hatch coamings, was loaded with heavy timbers, and that the remaining deck space, at the sides of the hatch, was loaded with loose lumber, consisting of pieces 2 X 3 and 1 12 , to a height 5 or 6 feet above the deck; that this lighter lumber, or a substantial part of it, had been loaded in sling loads, without repiling, in such negligent fashion as to render it unstable; that the pile of lumber, with the open hatch alongside, constituted an unsafe place to work for those required to go upon it, as the master knew; and that the upper part of the pile of lumber, on which respondent was standing in order to adjust a sling about some of the lumber to be unloaded, toppled over because of its instability, throwing him through the open hatch into the hold and causing the injuries complained of. The trial court refused requests to charge that assumption of the risk by respondent was a defense, but left it to the jury to say whether there was negligent failure of the master to provide a safe place for the respondent to work, and whether the failure was the proximate cause of the injury. It reduced the jury's verdict for respondent and gave judgment accordingly which the state supreme court sustained.\n Numerous grounds for reversal are urged here, of which only two require our notice. One is petitioner's contention that even though assumption of risk is not generally a defense to a suit brought under the Jones Act, it must \n\n[298 U.S. 124, 128]\n\u00a0\n be deemed available where, as in the present case, the injured seaman is employed on a coasting vessel which was in port at the time of the accident. It is argued that as he was not required to sign art cles, 18 Stat. 64, 46 U.S.C.  544 (46 U.S.C.A.  544) compare 46 U.S.C.  563 (46 U.S.C.A.  563), and consequently was not subject to the punishment for desertion prescribed by 46 U.S.C.  701-713 (46 U.S.C.A.  701-713), he was free to avoid the risk by leaving the vessel and his employment. The other objection is that the trial court erred in refusing petitioner's request to charge that if the jury should find that respondent, in placing the sling underneath the lumber, 'chose to perform the act in a dangerous manner such as stepping too near the edge of the deck load when there was a safe method of doing the work involving no risk of the edge of the deck load giving away, then the plaintiff cannot recover.'\n\n 1. \nThe effect of the Jones Act in bringing into the maritime law new rules of liability prescribed by the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 U.S.C.A.  51-59), has been considered in The Arizona, \n298 \nU.S. 110\n, 56 S. Ct. 707, 80 L.Ed. --, decided this day, and does not require extended discussion here. The injury resulting to the employee from the negligently piled lumber, in proximity to the open hatch, is made actionable by the Jones Act, by its adoption for the maritime law of the provisions of the Employers' Liability Act, which specifically imposes liability for negligence of officers and fellow employees, and for defects in equipment due to negligence. See Zinnel v. United States S.B.E.F. Corporation (C.C.A .) 10 F.(2d) 47; The Valdarno (C.C.A.) 11 F.(2d) 35; Howarth v. United States S.B.E.F. Corporation (C.C.A.) 24 F.(2d) 374; Hanson v. Luckenbach S. S. Co. (C.C.A.) 65 F.(2d) 457. Before the enactment of the Jones Act it was recognized that a 'failure to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship' is equivalent to unseaworthiness, and that it was likewise actionable under the maritime law, if it caused injury to a seaman. See The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n, 23 S.Ct. 483. Judge \n\n[298 U.S. 124, 129]\n\u00a0\n Addison Brown, sitting in admiralty, had allowed recovery to a seaman for injuries received in unloading lumber in circumstances substantially like the present, in The Frank and Willie (D.C.) 45 F. 494, cited with approval in The Osceola, supra, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 174\n, 23 S.Ct. 483. See, also, Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, \n259 \nU.S. 255, 259\n, 42 S.Ct. 475; Olson v. Flavel (D.C.) 34 F. 477.\n\n 2. \nIt is unnecessary to repeat here the reasons given in the opinion in The Arizona, supra, for our conclusion that assumption of risk is not a defense to a suit brought by a seaman under the Jones Act for negligent failure of the master to provide safe appliances or a safe place in which to work. Those reasons neither require nor admit of a different rule because of the circumstances of respondent's employment on which the petitioner relies. The rules, peculiar to admiralty, of liability for injuries to seamen or others, are as applicable when the injury occurs upon a vessel in port as when at sea, although the common law may apply a different rule to an injury similarly inflicted on the wharf to which the vessel is moored. The Frank and Willie, supra; and see Northern Coal & Dock Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142\n, 49 S.Ct. 88; Nogueira v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 128\n, 50 S.Ct. 303; Baizley Iron Works v. Span, \n281 \nU.S. 222\n, 50 S.Ct. 306; Employers' Liability Assurance Corporation v. Cook, \n281 \nU.S. 233\n, 50 S.Ct. 308; Uravic v. Jarka Co., \n282 \nU.S. 234\n, 51 S.Ct. 111.\n Nor do we perceive any adequate ground for judicial relaxation of the admiralty rule, applicable under the Jones Act, that assumption of risk is not a defense to a suit to recover for injury to a seaman resulting from unseaworthiness or defective equipment, because he chances to be in some measure less amenable to the iron discipline of the sea than others who go upon foreign voyages. Even so his freedom to avoid the risk is far from comparable to that of the employee on land where t e defense of assumption of risk originated and has been maintained. \n\n[298 U.S. 124, 130]\n\u00a0\n No such distinction appears to have been recognized in the maritime law. And we discern nothing in the purpose or in the language of the Jones Act or in the rules of liability which it prescribes to suggest that Congress undertook to introduce such a distinction into the maritime law.\n It is unnecessary to decide whether employees on a vessel who are not seamen according to the maritime law, but who have been given the status of seamen for the purpose of enabling them to bring suit under the Jones Act, see International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S.Ct. 19, are entitled to the immunity from the defense of assumption of risk accorded by the maritime law to seamen. Cf. Scheffler v. Moran Towing & Transportation Co. (C.C.A.) 68 F.(2d) 11; Skolar v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co. (C.C.A.) 60 F.(2d) 893.\n\n 3. \nWe find no prejudicial error in the refusal to give the requested charge as to the respondent's use of the sling. The trial judge did charge the jury that there could be no recovery unless it found that negligence of petitioner was the cause of the injury. Respondent was using the defectively piled lumber as a platform on which to stand when adjusting the sling under some of the lumber about to be unloaded. There is no suggestion in the evidence or by petitioner's requests that he could have stood elsewhere when performing that operation, or that he had any choice but to do his work there or leave the vessel. It may be that he was negligent in standing at one point rather than at another upon the unsafe pile of lumber, see Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492\n, 34 S.Ct. 635, L.R.A.1915C, 1, Ann.Cas.1915B, 475; cf. The Frank and Willie, supra, and that an instruction as to the effect of his negligence would have been appropriate. But we think the charge in the form requested, so far as applicable to the evidence, and in view of that actually given, amounted to \n\n[298 U.S. 124, 131]\n\u00a0\n no more than a request to charge that his negligence was a defense. Contributory negligence is not a defense to a suit brought either under the Jones Act or under the maritime law for injuries attributable to negligently defective equipment. Under both it is ground only for apportionment of the damage, see The Frank and Willie, supra; 35 Stat. 66, 45 U.S.C.  53 (45 U.S.C.A.  53). So far as the record discloses petitioner made no request for an instruction as to apportionment of the damage.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBINGAMAN v. GOLDEN EAGLE WESTERN LINES(1936)\nNo. 520\nArgued: March 5, 1936Decided: March 30, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of New Mexico.\n Messrs. J. R. Modrall, Quincy D. Adams, and Frank H. Patton, all of Santa Fe , N.M., for appellants.\n Messrs. Ivan Bowen, of Minneapolis, Minn., E. R. Wright, of Santa Fe , N.M., and Earl A. Bagby, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee, a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware, is a common carrier operating a line of busses over the public highways of several states, including New Mexico, its business being limited to interstate transportation. It does no intrastate business in New Mexico, and expressly disclaims any intention of doing any such \n\n[297 U.S. 626, 627]\n\u00a0\n busi ess in the future. The busses are propelled by gasoline, which, so far as this case is concerned, is purchased in another state, placed in tanks attached to the busses, and transported and used exclusively in interstate commerce.\n A statute of the state (chapter 176,  2, Session Laws of 1933) imposes 'an excise tax of five cents (5) per gallon upon the sale and use of all gasoline and motor fuel.' Section 3 of the act prohibits any 'distributor' from importing, receiving, using, selling or distributing any motor fuel, unless such distributor is the holder of an uncancelled annual license issued by the state comptroller. For the license a fee is exacted of $25 for each distribution station or place of business or agency. A 'distributor,' as defined by section 1 of the act, includes a corporation consuming and using in the state any motor fuel purchased in and brought from another state. For failure to comply with the statute penalties are incurred. The effect of the statute is to compel a common carrier engaged exclusively in interstate transportation to procure a licnese as a 'distributor' and pay an excise tax upon the use of motor fuel purchased in, and brought from, another state and used only in such transportation.\n By an act, passed in 1931, Laws 1931, c. 31, provision is made for refunding taxes collected upon the purchase of gasoline in certain specified quantities and used for other purposes than the operation of motor vehicles upon the streets and highways of the state.\n This suit was brought against appellants, state officers, to enjoin the threatened enforcement of the foregoing statutory provisions, together with the penal provisions connected therewith, on the ground, among others, that they constitute a regulation of interstate commerce in contravention of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. The case was heard by the lower court, con- \n\n[297 U.S. 626, 628]\n\u00a0\n sisting of three judges as the federal law requires (Jud.Code  266, 28 U. S.C.A.  380), and a decree entered in accordance with the prayer of the bill. Golden Eagle Western Lines, Inc., v. Bingaman (D.C.) 14 F.Supp. 17.\n The case turns upon the question whether the pertinent statutory provisions exact a charge as compensation to the state for the use of its highways, or impose an excise tax for the use of an instrumentality of interstate commerce. If the former, the tax should be sustained; if the latter, it clearly contravenes the commerce clause and must be held bad. Helson and Randolph v. Kentucky, \n279 \nU.S. 245\n, 49 S.Ct. 279, and cases cited. The state supreme court has construed the provisions in George E. Breece Lumber Co. v. Mirabal, 34 N.M. 643, 287 P. 699, 84 A.L.R. 827, and Transcontinental & Western Air, Inc., v. Lujan, 36 N.M. 64, 8 P.( 2d) 103; and the court below, rightly concluding that it was bound by this construction,* thought that it settled the matter against the validity of the tax. With this view we agree.\n The New Mexico decisions dealt with an earlier act, the terms of which, however, without material change, were carried forward into the act of 1933, with the result that the new act became a continuation of the earlier one. Bear Lake & River Waterworks & Irrigation Co. v. Garland, \n164 U.S. 1\n, 11-14, 17 S.Ct. 7. Compare Posadas v. National City Bank of New York, \n296 \nU.S. 497\n, 56 S.Ct. 349, January 6, 1936. In the Breece Case the state court held that the exaction was a general excise tax upon the use of all gasoline in the state, and that it was not imposed for the use of the state roads. The court considered the suggestion that the entire proceeds of the tax were devoted by law to the building and improvement of the state highways, but said that this would not alter the fact that the tax was not exacted for the privilege of using hese highways. The Lujan Case reached the same conclusion. The state\n * United States v. Kombst, \n286 \nU.S. 424, 426\n, 52 S.Ct. 616; Frost & Forst Trucking Co. v. Railroad Commission of California, \n271 \nU.S. 583, 591\n, 592 S., 46 S.Ct. 605, 47 A.L.R. 457. \n\n[297 U.S. 626, 629]\n\u00a0\n court crew a sharp distinction between the excise tax on the sale and that on the use of gasoline, holding the first to be valid and the second to be repugnant to the commerce clause of the federal Constitution as applied to an interstate air carrier. Both cases definitely refused to accept the view that the tax was a charge for the use of the highways.\n Appellants contend that the refund provisions of the later 1931 statute, supra, nevertheless, demonstrate that the state legislature intended that the excise tax now in question should constitute compensation for the use of the highways. But the so-called refund provisions apply only in the case of taxes collected upon the purchase of gasoline, not of taxes collected for its use. Moreover, the state court in the Lujan Case, 36 N.M. 64, at page 74, 8 P.(2d) 103, considered a like contention and rejected it as without substance.\n As applied to appellee, an interstate carrier doing no intrastate business of any description, section 3 of the act, which exacts license fees from distributors, is plainly invalid as imposing a direct burden upon interstate commerce.

Banks, Jr., and R. Ammi Cutter, both of Boston, Mass., for appellants.\n Mr. James J. Ronan, of Salem, Mass., for appellee. \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 282]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal is from an order denying abatement of succession taxes assessed in respect of the estate of Hetty S. L. Cunningham, late a resident of Brookline, Massachusetts. Mrs. Cunningham died intestate in August, 1931, leaving as her sole heirs four children, who, with the trustees and certain beneficiaries of three trusts wherein she had life estates, were the petitioners below and are the appellants here. She left a substantial estate of her own which descended to her four children. Their succession to this estate was taxed, the tax was paid, and its legality is not questioned. Pursuant to the terms of the three trusts, her four children succeeded, upon her death, to the ownership and possession of certain property whereof she had been life tenant with power of appointment of principal; and succeeded to the enjoyment as life beneficiaries of other property as to which she had preceded them as life tenant. The appellee held the succession to the trust property taxable, and added the value of the corpus of Mrs. Cunningham's own estate and that of the interests to which the appellants succeeded upon her death with the result that the trust interests took a higher rate. The taxes assessed upon the three trust interests were paid and a petition was filed in the probate court for abatement in the view that the exaction was forbidden by article 1,  10, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The probate court reserved the questions, the Supreme Judicial Court decided them adversely to appellants1 and upon its rescript the petition was denied.\n In 1877 Mrs. Cunningham (then Hetty Sullivan Lawrence) conveyed property in trust reserving a life estate in the income but no power to revoke, alter or amend. \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 283]\n\u00a0\n The income was to be paid for twenty years after her death 'to and among such of' her children as 'may be living at the time of payment,' living issue of a deceased child to take by right of representation. If, at her death, or at any time during the twenty years thereafter, no child or issue of hers should be living the trustees were to transfer the principal to the heirs of her father, if he were then dead; otherwise, to her own heirs. She married and had five children, one of whom, born in 1892, died in 1923, without issue. The others, born between 1885 and 1890, are appellants.\n In 1862 Amos A. Lawrence, the intestate's father, paid a sum of money to an insurance company which agreed to pay the income to the intestate and, upon her death, to distribute the principal and any unpaid income, to such persons as she might, by will, appoint, and in default of appointment, to her surviving children.\n Sarah E. Lawrence, the intestate's mother, died May 27, 1891. Her will bequeathed property in trust to pay the income to each of her six children, two of whom still survive, and to the issue, per stirpes, of any deceased child so long as any of her children should live. For twenty years after the death of the last survivor of her children the income was to be paid to her grandchildren and their issue, per stirpes, and, at the expiration of that period, the principal was to be divided between the grandchildren, per capita, descendants of a deceased grandchild to divide his or her share per stirpes. Each child of Sarah E. Lawrence was empowered to 'appoint the shares in which' the income given to his or her children and issue 'shall be apportioned among such children and issue' and further to appoint the proportions in which the principal 'shall be divided among such children and issue.' Under this provision the four children of Mrs. Cunningham, who are appellants, succeeded to equal life estates in their mother's share, she having failed to exercise her power. \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 284]\n\u00a0\n When the trusts were created Massachusetts imposed no inheritance or succession tax. The first statute imposing such a tax2 applied only to collateral inheritance and excluded devolution to lineal descendants. In 1907 a law was enacted taxing testamentary devolution of property to lineal descendants;3 this made no mention of powers of appointment; the tax was graduated according to amounts and relationships, but there was no requirement of aggregation of various interests passing and accruing to a single beneficiary from or on account of the death of a decedent to ascertain the rate of tax. Such a provision for uniting interests was enacted in 1924,4 and incorporated with the first section of the act of 1907 as amended into a single section. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The act of 1907 and its amendments were prospective in operation and exempted estates of those who had died prior to its effective date. \n6\n This exemption has extended to all interests which passed or accrued upon the death of Sarah E. Lawrence, the intestate's mother.\n In 1909 provision was made for a succession tax upon the occasion of the exercise of, or nonexercise of, powers of appointment. \n7\n This, in its present form, is section 2 of chapter 65 of the General Laws. \n8\n The effective date of this provision was declared to be September 1, 1907, which was the effective date of the 1907 act, and was twenty-one months prior to the effective date of the 1909 act in which the provision is embodied. It is conceded that there are no other statutes purporting to tax succession under nontestamentary gifts. \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 285]\n\u00a0\n The acts are compiled in the general laws of the Commonwealth, and, so far as material to the present controversy, are:\n General Laws (Ter.Ed.) c. 65:\n'Section 1. All property within the jurisdiction of the commonwealth, corporeal or incorporeal, and any interest therein, belonging to inhabitants of the commonwealth, ... which shall pass by will, or by laws regulating intestate succession, or by deed, grant or gift, except in cases of a bona fide purchase for full consideration in money or money's worth, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor or donor or made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after his death ... to any person, absolutely or in trust ... shall be subject to a tax at the percentage rates fixed by the following table: ... (A table of graduated rates here appears.)\n\n'Provided, however, that no property or interest therein, which shall pass or accrue to or for the use of a person in Class A, except a grandchild of the deceased, unless its value exceeds ten thousand dollars, and no other property or interest therein, unless its value exceeds one thousand dollars, shall be subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, and no tax shall be exacted upon any property or interest so passing or accruing which shall reduce the value of such property or interest below said amounts.\n\n'All property and interests therein which shall pass from a decedent to the same beneficiary by any one or more of the methods hereinbefore specified and all beneficial interests which shall accrue in the manner hereinbefore provided to such beneficiary on account of the death of such decedent shall be united and treated as a single interest for the purpose of determining the tax hereunder.\n\n'Section 2. Whenever any person shall exercise a power of appointment, derived from any disposition of property made prior to September first, nineteen hundred and \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 286]\n\u00a0\n seven, such appointment when made shall be deemed a disposition of property by the person exercising such power, taxable under section one, in the same manner as though the property to which such appointment relates belonged absolutely to the donee of such power, and had been bequeathed or devised by the donee by will; and whenever any person possessing such a power of appointment so derived shall omit or fail to exercise the same within the time provided therefor, in whole or in part, a disposition of property taxable under section one shall be deemed to take place to the extent of such omission or failure in the same manner as though the persons thereby becoming entitled to the possession or enjoyment of the property to which such power related had succeeded thereto by a will of the donee of the power failing to exercise such power, taking effect at the time of such omission or failure. ...\n\n'Section 36. This chapter shall apply only to property or interests therein passing or accruing upon the death of persons dying on or after May fourth, nineteen hundred and twenty, and as to all property and interests therein passing or accruing upon the death of persons who have died prior to said date the laws theretofore applicable shall remain in force; but so much of this chapter as relates to property or interests therein passing by deed, grant or gift completed inter vivos in contemplation of death shall apply only to such deeds, grants or gifts made on or after May twenty-seventh, nineteen hundred and twenty.'\n\n The 1877 Trust.\n The trust created by the intestate in 1877, by deed inter vivos, reserved no power of revocation or alteration and, in this respect, differed from that under consideration in Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S.Ct. 225. The appel- \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 287]\n\u00a0\n lants insist that the invalidity of section 1, supra, as applied to their succession is established by Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582\n, 51 S.Ct. 306, since to tax them would under the doctrine of that case impair the obligation of the intestate's contract, and deprive them of property without due process. The court below thought that case not controlling because there the remainders were vested from the date of the gift, whereas here the interests of appellants were executory or, at the best, contingent remainders which never vested until the intestate's death. In Coolidge v. Long this court concluded that the tax laid by the act of 1907 offended the contract and due process clauses of the federal Constitution because the interests of the remaindermen had vested at the date of the creation of the trust many years prior to the passage of the taxing act. It was held that the mere taking possession of that which had been vested in the beneficiaries for many years did not amount to a taxable occasion and constitutionally could not be so designated by the Commonwealth in view of the complete vesting of the beneficiaries' estates in remainder at the date of the execution of the deed.\n The Supreme Judicial Court, following an unbroken line of authority in Massachusetts, and in accordance with the common law9 and the law as declared by this court,10 holds that the appellants' estates, under the trust instrument of 1877, were, at most, contingent remainders which did not vest until after the intestate's death, and hence the transfers to them fell clearly within the statutory definition as made to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the donor's death. The appellants urge that, in imposing a succession tax, the state should disregard technical rules relating to the vesting of interests and look to the substance and they insist that for many \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 288]\n\u00a0\n years prior to 1907 those who were to take in succession to the intestate were ascertained, subject only to the contingency that, as in Coolidge v. Long, some of them might fall out of the class by death. The contention was made and rejected in Coolidge v. Long. The fact that the remainders were vested from the date of the deed, and the interests of those who took in remainder were merely subject to be defeated by a condition subsequent, was the basis for the conclusion that the tax could not constitutionally be laid upon the occasion of their acquiring physical possession of what had, in the eye of the law, long been their property. Having relied on legal rather than practical considerations to invalidate the tax in Coolidge v. Long it would be inconsistent here to rely on practical rather than legal considerations to invalidate the same tax. The Commonwealth was not prevented by the constitutional provisions which the appellants invoke from taxing the succession under the 1877 trust upon the occasion of the intestate's death since the appellants' estates never vested until that event.\n As Mrs. Cunningham's death was the occasion for a tax upon the succession of those who take in remainder after her life estate we can conceive of no constitutional objection to the statutory provisions for uniting the interest thus derived with that which the appellants acquired in Mrs. Cunningham's own property at her death, and calculating the rate on the total according to a sliding scale.\n The 1862 Trust.\n The act of 1907 (section 1, supra) does not purport to tax complete and irrevocable transfers inter vivos, not in contemplation of the donor's death, made subsequent to the effective date of the act. The 1862 contract was not made in contemplation of the grantor's death; it became effective when executed. Such a transfer made to-day would result in no tax upon the interest acquired by the \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 289]\n\u00a0\n life tenant or upon those interests resulting from her exercise or nonexercise of her power of appointment. By the act of 1909, however ( section 2, supra) the legislature, while not attempting to tax the interests of the appellants as derived in succession to Amos A. Lawrence, does essay to tax those interests as derived from the intestate as the holder of a power of appointment under Amos A. Lawrence's contract. But the statutes do not tax similar interests the enjoyment of which depends upon the exercise or nonexercise of a power embodied in a deed effective after September 1, 1907. The law, therefore, creates two classes-the one composed of beneficiaries who take at the death of the donee of a power created by an instrument antedating 1907, who are taxed-and the other of beneficiaries who take in succession to the donee of a power conferred by a deed executed subsequent to 1907, who are not taxed. Upon its face the statute arbitrarily selects a past date, taxing the beneficiaries of an act if done prior to, and leaving untaxed beneficiaries of a precisely similar act if done subsequent to that date. In justification of the discrimination the court below suggests that any change in the state's policy of taxation must take effect at some point of time. The truth of this statement is obvious but the appellants' complaint is not directed at the fact that inheritances occurring prior to the effective date of the act of 1907 have escaped taxation while those happening thereafter are subjected to the exaction. The claim that the statutes deny equal protection is based upon quite another sort of discrimination. Succession consequent upon testamentary gifts (that is those made by will, or in contemplation of death or to take effect in possession or enjoyment after death) made or to take effect after the date of the act is the subject of the excise. The succession to nontestamentary gifts made subsequent to the effective date of the act of 1907 is not taxed whether the \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 290]\n\u00a0\n person coming into ownership and enjoyment of property does so by virtue of the direct gift of the former owner or by virtue of the exercise or nonexercise of a power of appointment vested by the former owner in a third party. Thus the future policy of the Commonwealth is declared to be that those who benefit by a testamentary gift are to be taxed while those who benefit, either immediately or remotely, from a complete and irrevocable gift inter vivos are not to be taxed. On the other hand, the statutes declare that one who benefits remotely through the exercise or nonexercise of a power under an absolute gift long since completed is to bear the burden of the exaction. This is not the declaration of a new policy effective after the promulgation of the legislation. On the contrary the statutes declare the policy to be the exemption for the future of a well-known type of succession, while at the same time imposing a tax on the identical type if resulting from a past gift.\n Neither the appellee nor the Supreme Judicial Court advances any satisfactory reason for this difference in treatment of persons similarly circumstanced.\n The Supreme Judicial Court states: 'The legislative intent possibly was to tax succession under St.1907, c. 563, not as from the donee but from the donor of the power. Whatever the reason, the classification cannot be pronounced arbitrary or unreasonable. The tax operates equally and uniformly as to all within this class. It may fairly have been deemed by the General Court to be founded in the 'purposes and policy of taxation.\"\n Instead of assigning any reason for the discrimination the statement merely points out that two classes are created, those who are taxed and those who are not, and since all who are taxed are treated alike and all who are exempt are treated alike the statute is uniform in opera- \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 291]\n\u00a0\n tion upon each class; and this falls short of meeting the question for decision.\n As we have noted the only basis for the classification is the time when the estate was created. This court has said that a tax on gifts inter vivos, so laid as to hit those made within a given period prior to the donor's death and exempting all others, would be wholly arbitrary. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230\n, 46 S.Ct. 260, 43 A.L. R. 1224. And we have also said that a discrimination in the taxation of loans based solely upon the time when the loan was made would clearly be arbitrary and capricious. Colgate v. Harvey, \n296 \nU.S. 404, 425\n, 56 S.Ct. 252, 257, 102 A.L.R. 54.\n It is said that prior to the passage of the act of 1909 succession derived through a power granted by an instrument effective before September 1, 1907, escaped taxation although the interest of the beneficiary really had its origin subsequent to that date; and thereby the Commonwealth unfairly lost taxes which were its due and discrimination resulted between beneficiaries under trusts created before and after September 1, 1907. The argument, however, overlooks the fact that a transfer through a power created after September 1, 1907, is, notwithstanding the act of 1909, still wholly untaxed where, as in the case of the trust under consideration, the power is to be exercised by a third party and the gift is not made in contemplation of the settlor's death. We fail to see how fairness, either to the Commonwealth or its citizens, is promoted by taxing the appellants, the beneficiaries of a trust made many years before the succession tax laws were adopted while exempting beneficiaries similarly situated in all respects save only that the trust was created after September 1, 1907. The discrimination becomes the more glaring when it is remembered that the tax is increased by the aggregation of the interest passing to the beneficiaries under the 1862 contract with that which they derive by inheritance from the intestate. Thus a \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 292]\n\u00a0\n beneficiary taking through a power under an inter vivos non-testamentary trust, created after September 1, 1907, would not have to aggregate the interest so derived with property inherited from the donee of the power, whereas one taking, as do the appellants, under a power in a deed executed in 1862 is compelled, by aggregation of the interests, to pay at a much higher rate on the property derived through the power.\n In view of the hostile discrimination against a class of remaindermen arbitrarily singled out for taxation from all those similarly situated, we are bound to hold the statutes deny the equal protection of the laws in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The 1891 Trust.\n In their operation upon the trust created in 1891 by the will of Sarah E. Lawrence the statutes discriminate between the appellants and others similarly situated. The discrimination differs in kind from that exhibited in the case of the 1862 trust but is equally hostile and arbitrary.\n When Mrs. Lawrence died in 1891 the interests created in her lineal descendants were wholly exempt from taxation. When, in 1907, the Commonwealth adopted a policy of taxing succession by lineals the statute said nothing of powers of appointment. Nevertheless, under that act, had it been in force when Mrs. Lawrence died, the intestate, her daughter, would have paid a tax upon the value of the life estate given her by her mother's will and the appellants when they came into possession of remainder interests, upon the intestate's death, would likewise have been compelled to pay a tax upon their succession to Mrs. Lawrence's estate. The act of 1909 (section 2, supra) recognizing that the act of 1907 ( section 1, supra) does not apply to the succession generated at the death of Mrs. Lawrence nevertheless pitches upon the fact that under her will the intestate had a power of appointment and \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 293]\n\u00a0\n makes the takers of Mrs. Lawrence's property in succession to the intestate liable for a tax as if the property had descended from the intestate. As directed by section 1 the appellee aggregated the interest falling to the appellants under their grandmother's will with that coming to them from their mother under the intestate law. Thus the interest derived under the 1891 trust is taxed in the higher brackets at four per cent whereas had it been created by a will effective after September 1, 1907, the tax would be computed as upon a succession to Mrs. Lawrence's estate alone, and at a rate of one per cent.\n The same considerations which have been stated in respect of the 1862 trust are controlling as to this one. We think it an arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination that the beneficiary of a power must aggregate the interest so derived with that enjoyed by inheritance of property owned in fee by the donee of the power, if the instrument creating the power antedates 1907, but need not so aggregate the interests for the purpose of taxation if the creation of the power be subsequent to 1907. The consequence that the one must pay at a higher rate on the interest falling in at the death of the donee of the power than the other who takes by reason of an exactly similar event, denies the equal protection of the law to the former.\n The argument that the act of 1909 tends to render collection of taxes more certain by accelerating the time of payment and making the executors the collectors of the tax is answered by the provisions of section 7 of chapter 65 of the General Laws (Ter.Ed.). Remaindermen become liable for the tax not at the death of the donor but when they come into possession and enjoyment of the property at the expiration of a life estate or term of years. The tax on their succession is then payable by any fiduciary who then holds the property, and, if none is in office, by the beneficiaries themselves. It cannot \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 294]\n\u00a0\n therefore successfully be contended that the act of 1909 was adopted with a view to earlier or more certain collection of the tax.\n The Commonwealth seeks to support the statutes upon well known principles: that the guaranty of equal protection does not compel adoption of an iron rule of equal taxation, preclude variety in taxation, or forbid classification of subjects if the discrimination is founded upon a reasonable distinction or if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived to sustain it; and that where the evident purpose is to deal fairly and equitably in classifying the subjects of taxation, a statute will not be condemned because of minor and incidental hardships or inequalities due not to a hostile purpose but to inherent difficulties or inadvertence. The claim is that the discrimination against the appellants is justified by either or both of these principles. While this court always accords great weight to the judgment of a state legislature, we cannot agree that there is here a fair basis for difference of treatment. All that is said in defense of the statute is that it treats alike all those who take under instruments executed prior to an arbitrary past date, and treats alike all those who take under instruments made subsequent to the same arbitrary date, and that the legislature may have found some reason for the discrimination in the state's policy of taxation. But this is merely to say that arbitrary classification which is the result of the exercise of the legislative will must be sustained. The alternative and inconsistent contention that the discrimination is the result of inadvertence cannot prevail. The act of 1907 was prospective in its operation. Knowing that that act did not reach successions under deeds or wills effective prior to September 1, 1907, the legislature adopted the acts of 1909 and 1924 to put those who succeeded to remainder interests created prior to September 1, 1907, into a taxable class while \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 295]\n\u00a0\n leaving wholly exempt or taxing on a different basis and at a different rate remaindermen taking under instruments effective subsequent to September 1, 1907. To suggest that this was an attempt to bring about equality which failed through inadvertence is to be blind to the obvious purpose and intent of the legislature. Action could not have been more deliberate.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting in part.\n I am unable to concur in so much of the opinion of the court as invalidates the tax upon the interests passing to the appellants under the deed of 1862 and reduces the amount of the tax under the will of 1891\n\n\n On September 1, 1907, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts laid a tax upon the subject of any transfer to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of a donor, whether the succession was brought about by will or intestacy or gift inter vivos. Acts 1907, c. 563. This court held in Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582\n, 51 S.Ct. 306, that as to remainders already vested, but dependent upon an estate for life, the tax so imposed is a denial of due process, though the life estate did not end until after the passage of the statute. In 1909 the legislature of the Commonwealth enacted another statute providing in substance that where the transfer becomes complete through the exercise or nonexercise of a power of appointment (cf. Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260, 270\n, 271 S., 48 S.Ct. 225, 226, 227; Guaranty Trust Co. v. Blodgett, \n287 \nU.S. 509, 511\n, 53 S.Ct. 244, 245) the succession shall be deemed to have been derived from the donee of the power, if the power had its origin in a disposition of property made before September 1, 1907, and \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 296]\n\u00a0\n if made after that date, from the donor of the power. Acts 1909, c. 527,  8; G.L.(Ter.Ed.) c. 65,  2. Is the result of that amendment an unlawful discrimination when applied to the deed of 1862 and the exercise or nonexercise of the power there created?\n If succession must be treated as derived from the donor, irrespective of the date when the power was created, many interests will go free that in fairness should contribute their quota to the fisc. 'Whatever be the technical source of title of a grantee under a power of appointment, it cannot be denied that in reality and substance it is the execution of the power that gives to the grantee the property passing under it.' Matter of Dows' Estate, 167 N.Y. 227, 231, 60 N.E. 439, 441, 52 L.R.A. 433, 88 Am.St. Rep. 508, affirmed sub. nom. Orr v. Gilman, \n183 \nU.S. 278, 287\n, 22 S.Ct. 213; Matter of Delano's Estate, 176 N.Y. 486, 68 N.E. 871, 64 L.R.A. 279, affirmed sub. nom. Chanler v. Kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466, 478\n, 27 S.Ct. 550. This court has held that a legislature does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment by giving heed to these realities when taxing a succession. Orr v. Gilman, supra; Chanler v. Kelsey, supra. The cases that have been cited had their origin in New York. For a time the tax laws of Massachusetts were drawn along stricter lines. Emmons v. Shaw, 171 Mass. 410, 413, 50 N.E. 1033. Until the act of 1909, a transfer through a power, if made under an instrument effective before September, 1907, escaped taxation altogether, though the gift in substance and reality may have had its origin thereafter. Acts 1907, c. 563,  25; cf. Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, supra; also Saltonstall v. Treasurer and Receiver General, 256 Mass. 519, 522, 525, 153 N.E. 4. This was unfair to the Commonwealth. It was perhaps unfair to legatees who were taxable under gifts of later date. But the evil, however patent, was not subject to correction through the medium of a uniform rule taxing the succession under every power of appointment exercised thereafter, and taxing it as derived from the primary donor. Such a method of assessment would be adequate in its application to instruments to be executed in the \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 297]\n\u00a0\n future, but quite inadequate as to instruments executed in the past. There was need for a distinction based on difference in time.\n One may take for illustration a will made in 1914, seven years after the act of 1907, and another made in 1900, seven years before. Each, let it be assumed, provides for a life estate, with power to the life tenant to appoint the remainder, and with a gift over to children in default of an appointment. The life tenants die in 1921. If an assessment is made upon the right of succession under the will of later date, there will be no difficulty in collecting the tax, economically and swiftly, out of the estate of the donor. The power having been created after 1907, the executors will be under a duty to retain so much of the estate as may be necessary to pay the tax in full. But in respect of the 1900 will, the situation is very different. The probability is that before the adoption of the statute the executors under that instrument will have been given their discharge. In that event the probate court will no longer have control of the estate, and the Commonwealth will be left to a precarious remedy against remaindermen deriving their possession through the nonexercise of the power, if perchance the failure to exercise it becomes known at all. Estates of subsequent donors will thus be made to bear the burden while those of earlier donors are left substantially immune. The amendment of 1909 corrects that inequality. Has it substituted another to be condemned as more offensive?\n The rule is elementary that a state in adopting a system of taxation is not confined to a formula of rigid uniformity. Swiss Oil Corp. v. Shanks, \n273 \nU.S. 407, 413\n, 47 S.Ct. 393, 395. It may tax some kinds of property at one rate, and others at another, and exempt others altogether. Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232\n, 10 S. Ct. 533; Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 142\n, 45 S.Ct. 424, 426, 44 A.L.R. 1454; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 150\n, 50 S.Ct. 310, 311.

What is true of division into classes according to subject-matter must be true of division into classes dependent upon time. The temporal arrangement must have its origin, to be sure, in something more than whim or fantasy, a tyrannical exhibition of arbitrary power. If that reproach has been avoided, the classification does not fail because the burdens before and after are not always and everywhere in perfect equilibrium.\n From all this it follows that a distinction between wills or deeds effective before 1907 and those effective afterwards-the exercise or nonexercise of powers under instruments of the first class giving rise to a succession to be taxed as a bequest from the donee, and the exercise or nonexercise of powers under instruments of the second class to be taxed as a bequest from the donor-is not rooted in caprice. The point of time which separates the classes is not interjected arbitrarily or by an exertion of brute force, but corresponds to the behests of a rational taxonomy. This being so, the division ought not to fail because the deed of 1862 was framed in such a way that succession thereunder would not have been taxable to any one, either the estate of the donor or that of the donee, if a like deed had been executed after the passage of the statute. A legislature cannot be expected in drafting legislation to think out every conceivable situation in which the members of one class will bear a heavier burden than the members of another. Under the statute challenged as invalid many deeds inter vivos continue to be taxable irrespective of their date. An interest in re- \n\n[299 U.S. 280, 299]\n\u00a0\n mainder to take effect in possession or enjoyment through the exercise or nonexercise of a power of appointment after the death of the donor ( Guaranty Trust Co. v. Blodgett, supra) will gain nothing from the fact that a non-testamentary conveyance brought the power into being. The only reason why this particular interest would be exempt if the deed of 1862 had been made after August, 1907, is because the remainder was so limited that the power might be exercised while the donor was yet alive. Such untoward accidents do not take a method of division out of the domain of the rational into the land of whim and fantasy. Eccentricities of incidence are common, and perhaps inevitable, in every system of taxation. The future would have to be scanned with miscroscopical powers of vision to foresee and forestall every possible diversity. For present purposes it is enough that the order of events removes the stigma of caprice from a system of classification whereby donees of a power before the passage of the act are treated as grantors, the tax to be laid upon that basis, whereas donors of a power are recognized as the source of the succession in respect of transfers afterwards.

TEN EYCK(1936)\nNo. 597\nArgued: January 6, 1936Decided: February 10, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 252]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter E. Hope, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 251, 255]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel Kramer, of New York City, for appellee State of New York.\n Mr. Henry S. Manley, of Albany, N.Y., for appellee Ten Eyck and others. \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 256]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause is here a second time. The prior appeal was from a decree denying a preliminary injunction and dismissing the bill. \n1\n We reversed, holding that evidence should be taken, findings and conclusions made, and a decree thereupon entered. After remand the appellant amended its bill, the court sent the case to a master who made findings of fact, stated his conclusions of law, and \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 257]\n\u00a0\n recommended that an injunction be entered. The District Court accepted the master's findings, and found certain additional facts, but dismissed the bill upon the merits. \n2\n From this judgment the present appeal was taken.\n As will appear by reference to our former opinion, the appellant's complaint is that the fixing of a differential of not to exceed one cent per quart on sales to stores, in favor of milk dealers not having a 'well advertised trade name,' by the Milk Control Law of April 10, 1933, Laws N. Y. 1933, c. 158 (re-enacted by the Laws N.Y. 1934, c. 126 (Agriculture and Markets Law N.Y., Consol. Laws, N.Y. c. 69,  258-q, as added by Laws N.Y. 1934, c. 126,  2)), was an invasion of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The bill, as framed when the case was here before, recited that the administrative authority which fixed the minimum price on sales to stores found the appellant and three other milk dealers in the metropolitan market had well-advertised trade-names and the statute permitted dealers not having such trade-names to sell bottled milk to stores at one cent per quart less than the minimum which dealers with well advertised trade-names were required to charge, and also permitted stores to resell to their customers the unadvertised brands of milk at a price one cent per quart less than that at which the appellant's milk could be sold under the minimum fixed by the order. Resulting loss of business and irreparable damage were alleged.\n In this court the appellees sought to justify the differential by the assertion that the statute was temporary in character, intended to relieve a temporary economic situation, and meanwhile to prevent monopoly of the business by dealers having well-advertised names. In support of this position it was said that prior to the adoption of the Milk Control Act of 1933 independent dealers, so-called, had purchased from producers at prices lower than \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 258]\n\u00a0\n those paid by appellant and other purveyors of well-advertised brands, and in turn charged less to stores than the appellant and others in its class. By the Milk Control Act the independent dealers were compelled to purchase from the farmers on the same basis as the well-known dealers; and to deprive them of this advantage and in turn to compel them to charge the same price for their milk as the well-advertised brands commanded would be to transfer all their customers to the owners of well-known brands, and put them out of business. The appellant replied that, prior to the adoption of the Milk Control Law, there had been a threat to forbid the sale of milk in bulk to stores; this compelled the independents who had formerly sold mostly bulk milk to change to the bottled trade, and keen competition ensued between them and the owners of well-advertised brands with destructive price cutting throughout the greater part of New York City, so that there was no fixed price for bottled milk sold to stores either by the independents or the well-advertised dealers. In support of these contentions we were referred to statements found in the legislative report leading to the adoption of the Milk Control Law, and the injunction affidavits.\n We held we could not take judicial notice of local trade conditions prevailing in the city of New York; as the case had been disposed of below on the allegations of the bill, we were not called upon to examine the affidavits submitted in support of the motion for injunction and to find the facts; and the constitutionality of the challenged provision should be determined in the light of evidence upon the matters as to which the parties were in disagreement.\n By amendment the appellant added to its bill paragraphs to the following effect: Prior to 1932 less than one-third of the fluid milk sold in New York was bottled, the balance being sold in bulk and under no trade- name. \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 259]\n\u00a0\n Toward the end of 1931 a commission recommended that the sale of loose milk to stores be prohibited. The Board of Health made an order, effective January 1, 1933, the effective date of which was subsequently postponed to June 1, 1933, prohibiting the practice. By reason of the impending ban upon the sale of loose milk, dealers engaged in the sale of that commodity were forced to make a drastic change in their methods. The transition from the sale of loose milk to bottled, which began about April 1, 1933, and continued until June 1, 1933, engendered widespread price cutting and a steadily declining price level, and brought about unsettled market conditions and great variations in price. At no time prior to the effective date of the Milk Control Act was there any trade custom, practice, or usage whereby the bottled milk of dealers thereafter classified as not having well-advertised trade-names was sold to stores at a price different from that of the bottled milk of the appellant and others classified as having well-advertised trade-names. Before April 10, 1933, and thereafter, the appellant was in active competition with more than 150 dealers in the sale of bottled milk to stores in the city. The appellant and others classified as having well-advertised trade-names sell approximately 21 per cent. of the bottled milk sold to stores. The prices paid by dealers to producers under the Milk Control Law have been the same for all dealers no matter how classified. All bottled milk must have printed on the cap the name of the dealer distributing it. The services rendered by the appellant and by so-called independent dealers differ in no respect.\n The assertions of shrinkage of appellant's sales to stores consequent upon the establishment of the differential were repeated and amplified in the amended bill. An answer was filed denying the allegations of the bill. Much evidence was received. \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 260]\n\u00a0\n The findings of the master establish that the dealers having a well- advertised trade-name, of which appellant is one, are in keen competition with each other and with the independent dealers, and have no monopoly, nor anything approaching a monopoly, of the sale of bottled milk to stores. The findings further demonstrate that the good will incident to appellant's well-known trade-name 'Borden's' has been built up largely by advertising, and there is no finding that the appellant's methods in that respect, or its trade practices, have been illegal. Grade B milk, with which we are alone concerned, must conform to standards of quality, purity, and cleanliness prescribed by law, whether sold by appellant or by an independent dealer. The service rendered and the conditions of sale are the same for both. It is plain from these facts that the allowance of the differential cannot be justified as a preventive of monopoly or as a deterrent of illegal combination or illegal trade practices, or as a recognition of differences in the service rendered.\n We are brought to the remaining issue of fact to resolve which the case was remanded. Was there a differential during a substantial period prior to adoption of the act between the price charged to stores by dealers having well-advertised trade-names and that charged by those lacking this advantage?\n The master's findings upon the point, though the appellant excepted to them, were adopted by the court below. They are to the effect that from November, 1931, to April, 1933, and for several years prior thereto, the independent dealers sold their bottled milk to stores in New York City for resale to consumers at one or more cents per quart below the price at which the advertised dealers were selling their bottled milk to stores in that city; and during the same years the stores were selling the independents' bottled milk to consumers from one cent to two cents per quart below the price at which they were \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 261]\n\u00a0\n vending the bottled milk of the advertised dealers. The District Court made additional findings, supplementing those of the master, that independent dealers on occasions before November 1, 1931, and until April 1, 1933, tried to sell bottled milk to stores at the same price as that charged by the appellant and another advertised dealer, and in each case were compelled by loss of business to resume their earlier and lower price; and during the same period customers when offered the several brands at the same price would usually take a bottle of the well-advertised dealer's milk in preference to that of an independent dealer. These findings of the master and the court disclose the circumstances in the light of which the appellant's claim that it was denied the equal protection of the laws must be considered. The appellant assig  them as error; but they are supported by substantial evidence and we will not disturb them.\n We hold that the fixing of the differential in favor of the sellers of milk not having a well-advertised trade-name, in the situation exhibited by the findings, does not deny the appellant equal protection.\n The argument is that the classification is arbitrary, since the statute puts the appellant and other dealers who have well-advertised trade-names in a single class solely by reason of the fact that their legitimate advertising has brought them good will. So, it is said, they are penalized for their business skill and acumen. The answer seems sufficiently obvious. In enforcing its policy of price fixing-a temporary expedient to redress an injurious economic condition-the Legislature believed that a fixed minimum price by dealers to stores would not preserve the existing economic method of attaining equality of opportunity. That method was for the well-advertised dealers to rely on their advertising to obtain a given price, and for the independents to retain their share of the market, not by counter advertising but by slight \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 262]\n\u00a0\n reduction of price. The one expedient the law did not purport to touch; the other by fixing the same minimum for all dealers it would effectually destroy. In these circumstances, it was competent to the lawmakers to attempt, during the limited term of the legislative experiment, to preserve the existing relationship of advantage established by the past trade practices of the two groups. So to do, we must assume, was within the legislative power under the State Constitution. No prohibition of the expedient is found in the Federal Constitution, unless in the Fourteenth Amendment. We have held that article does not prevent the fixing of maximum and minimum prices for milk, in the circumstances existing in the state of New York in 1933.3 We now hold that to provide that a differential of one cent maintained by the independent dealers shall continue does not deny their advertised competitors equal protection. There was a plain reason for the classification. It was not merely that appellant had established a good will; it was that there had resulted a balance between that advantage and the resulting disadvantage to the unadvertised dealer, a balance maintained by a price differential. To attempt the maintenance of that balance was to strive for equality of treatment, equality of burden, not to create inequality. To adapt the law to the existing trade practice was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. The present case affords an excellent example of the difficulties and complexities which confront the legislator who essays to interfere in sweeping terms with the natural laws of trade or industry. The danger in such efforts always is that unintended dislocations will bring hardship to groups whose situation the broad rules fail to fit. Where, as here, there is recognition of an existing status and an attempt to equate the incidence of the statute in accordance with it, we find a \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 263]\n\u00a0\n compliance with, rather than a disregard of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. The appellant cannot complain if, in fact, the discrimination embodied in the law is but a perpetuation of a classification created and existing by the action of the dealers. In the light of the facts found, the Legislature might reasonably have thought trade conditions existed justifying the fixing of a differential. Judicial inquiry does not concern itself with the accuracy of the legislative finding, but only with the question whether it so lacks any reasonable basis as to be arbitrary. Standard Oil Company v. Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582, 586\n, 587 S., 49 S.Ct. 430.\n A second argument is that, instead of maintaining equality between the two groups, the act has destroyed it by unduly favoring the independents. The differential is said to inflict grievous injury and irreparab e and continuing damage upon the appellant. We must look to the record to determine whether it supports the appellant's claim. The master made numerous findings touching the relative sales of bulk and bottled milk to stores by the two groups of dealers at various times before and after the adoption of the act, and in respect of appellant's share of that trade in comparison with total sales and those of its independent competitors. He also found: 'Since the enactment of the 1933 Law, the advertised dealers have had a smaller proportion relative to the independent dealers of the total sales of bottled milk to stores in New York City than before the enactment of the law.' But neither in his findings nor in his general discussion does he say that the smaller volume of appellant is due to the differential provision. He does state: 'The voluminous proofs fail to furnish facts on which to base a finding as to the effect of minimum prices without a differential.' There is no fact finding of loss and damage to plaintiff from the differential. A conclusion of law is: 'By reason of the differential provision, the \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 264]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff is now suffering, and will continue to suffer irreparable damage.' After a full discussion of the master's findings, the District Court said: 'From all this it seems to us very doubtful whether the differential has really damaged the plaintiff at all.' We have examined the findings and the evidence, and concur in the conclusion. Though appellant, at the time of the trial, had acquired a large experience of the operation of the differential, its proofs and the findings based upon them, leave serious doubt as to the effect on the appellant's store trade of other factors, such as seasonal variation, the decrease in the consumption of milk in 1934, the change from loose to bottled milk in store distribution, and the sale of great quantities of so-called relief milk under arrangement with the public authorities. It has failed to show that as a result of the statute the independent dealers have gained trade at its expense, or that it has suffered substantial loss.\n We have no occasion to determine whether the differential would become unlawful, and the appellant would be entitled to relief, if there were proof that in practice it produces such gross inequality, and so unnecessarily damages the appellant, as to shock the conscience.\n Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting).\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and I think the challenged judgment should be reversed.\n In Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502, 539\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469, we stated reasons in support of the conclusion that the New York Milk Control Act of 1933 infringed the due process clause. We adhere to what we there said.\n The present cause raises a distinct, although subordinate, question. Assuming that the general price fixing provisions of the Control Act are valid, do the provisions \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 265]\n\u00a0\n which permit other dealers to sell below the minimum price prescribed for appellant deprive it of the equal protection of the laws? The answer should be in the affirmative.\n Rational classification, based on substantial differences, is within legislative power. An act which permits dealer A to sell at less than the price fixed for dealer B obviously denies equality; and in the absence of some adequate reason for different treatment, the enactment is invalid.\n Here appellant differs from favored dealers only in that it possesses a well-advertised brand, while they do not. And solely because of that fact, the Legislature undertook to handicap it and thus enable others profitably to share the trade. There is no question of unfair trade practices or monopoly.\n By fair advertisement and commendable service, appellant acquired the public's good will. The purpose is to deprive it of the right to benefit by this and thereby aid competitors to secure the business. This is grossly arbitrary and oppressive.\n To support the legisl tion, it is said the Legislature believed that a fixed minimum price to stores would not preserve the existing economic method of attaining equality of opportunity. Apparently, this means that a dealer, who through merit has acquired a good reputation, can be deprived of the consequent benefit in order that another may trade successfully. Thus the statute destroys equality of opportunity-puts appellant at a disadvantage because of merit.\n Merely because on a given date there were differences in prices under open competition, offers no rational reason for legislation abolishing competition and perpetuating such differences. The status existing under competitive conditions certainly is not preserved by destroying competition. Formerly, appellant had the right to adjust prices to meet trade exigencies and thus protect itself \n\n[297 U.S. 251, 266]\n\u00a0\n from loss of business. Now it must stand helpless while adversaries take possession of the field. It may suffer utter ruin solely because of good reputation, honestly acquired. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Borden's Farm Products Co. v.

Archibald B. Dorman and Jefferson P. Chandler, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. Herbert W. Clark, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by petitioner against respondents to have impressed in his favor a trust in respect of a portion of a lease, executed by the United States, of oil and gas lands in the State of California.\n The bill alleges that petitioner, since March, 1919, has been the owner and in possession of certain legal subdivisions of section 30, township 21 south, range 17 east, Mount Diablo Meridian, Fresno county, California, embracing 322.89 acres; that by reason of such ownership, he has been at all times since February 25, 1920, entitled to a preference right for a permit to prospect on such land for oil and minerals and, in case of discovery thereon, to a lease under the provisions of section 20 of the Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, 41 Stat. 437, 445 (30 U.S.C.A.  229), which provides: 'In the case of lands bona fide entered as agricultural, and not withdrawn or classified as mineral at the time of entry, ... the entryman or patentee, or assigns, ... if \n\n[299 U.S. 65, 67]\n\u00a0\n the entry has been patented with the mineral right reserved, shall be entitled to a preference right to a permit and to a lease, as herein provided, in case of discovery.' The bill further alleges that petitioner made a bona fide entry of the land in question as agricultural; that the land was not withdrawn or classified as mineral at the time of his entry; that the entry was patented to him with a reservation of oil and gas to the United States under the provisions of the Act of July 17, 1914, 38 Stat. 509 (30 U.S.C.A.  121, 122). In May, 1921, it is alleged, one of the defendants illegally and wrongfully, and with knowledge of petitioner's rights, secured a purported permit to prospect for oil and gas on a large tract, which included the land described; that the issue of the permit was in violation of petitioner's preference right and operated to deny his right to procure a United States oil and gas prospecting permit to prospect thereon and to a lease in case of discovery, for the reason that no personal notice, as required by regulations of the Interior Department and the provisions of the Leasing Act, or notice of any kind, was given to petitioner, who had no notice of the issue of such purported permit until about the month of July, 1928. The bill further alleges that Pacific Western Oil Company acquired from the original permittee all his right, title, and interest in and to the permit, and that by reason thereof a lease was executed by the Secretary of the Interior to that company, granting the exclusive right to drill and explore for oil and minerals in said land; that such company is now the legal owner of the lease, and wrongfully holds it in violation of petitioner's prior and superior equitable rights; and that the other respondents named have or claim, adversely to petitioner, some interest in the lands in question and the lease covering the same.\n An amendment to the bill, made by stipulation of the parties, alleges that petitioner's entry was made on March \n\n[299 U.S. 65, 68]\n\u00a0\n 6, 1919, and patent issued to him on October 7, 1925. Copies of the entry, with Land Office indorsements, and of the patent are attached and made part of the bill. The entry is in usual form and concludes, over the signature of petitioner, with the words, 'Subject to provisions and reservations and limitations of Act of July 17, 1914,' and was stamped by the Land Office, 'Application made in accordance with and subject to the provisions and reservations of the Act of July 17, 1914.'\n The patent expressly excepts and reserves to the United States all the oil and gas in the lands patented, and to it, or persons authorized by it, the right to prospect for, mine and remove therefrom such oil and gas upon compliance with the conditions and subject to the provisions and limitations of the Act of July 17, 1914. Section 1 of that act provides that lands withdrawn or classified as phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil, gas, or asphaltic minerals, etc., shall be subject to entry, if otherwise available, under the nonmineral land laws, when made with a view of obtaining title 'with a reservation to the United States of the deposits on account of which the lands were withdrawn or classified ... together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same. ... (Provided, That) All applications to locate, select, enter, or purchase under this section shall state that the same are made in accordance with and subject to the provisions and reservations of this Act (the above mentioned sections).' Chapter 142, 38 Stat. 509 (30 U.S.C.A.  121).\n There was also attached to the stipulation a copy of an order of withdrawal made by the President December 30, 1910, as follows: 'It is hereby ordered that the following described lands be, and the same are hereby withdrawn from settlement, location, sale or entry, and reserved for classification and in aid of legislation affecting the use and disposal of petroleum lands belonging to the United States, subject to all of the provisions, limitations, exceptions, and con- \n\n[299 U.S. 65, 69]\n\u00a0\n ditions contained in the Act of Congress entitled 'An Act to authorize the President of the United States to make withdrawals of public lands in certain cases,' approved June 25, 1910: ...' Among the lands described is the land here in question.\n In the District Court, respondents moved to dismiss the bill on the grounds: First, that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a valid cause of action in equity or at law against them or either of them; second, that the United States was an indispensable party to a complete determination of the suit; third, that petitioner was guilty of laches and his cause of complaint was stale. The District Court denied the motion without prejudice to a renewal later and, after answer by respondents, proceeded to a hearing on the merits. After such hearing it held that petitioner was not entitled to a preference right nor to a lease of the lands in question; that respondents Kettleman Oil Corporation and Pacific Western Oil Company were the owners in equal proportions of the oil and gas lease executed by the Secretary of the Interior to the latter company; and that petitioner be denied all relief.\n An appeal followed to the Court of Appeals. That court, without passing upon the merits, held that the United States was an indispensable party, which could not be sued for lack of its consent, for which reason that court and the district court were without jurisdiction; and upon that ground it dismissed the suit. 80 F.(2d) 774.\n The case presented by the bill comes to this: Petitioner asserts a preference right to prospect for oil and other minerals and, if successful, to obtain a lease under section 20 of the Leasing Act of 1920, in virtue of his homestead entry in 1919 and patent in 1925. It appears, however, from the allegations of his bill and the exhibits attached, that the entry was subject to the provisions of the Act of July 17, 1914, among which is the limitation reserving \n\n[299 U.S. 65, 70]\n\u00a0\n to the United States all oil and minerals in the lands entered on account of which the lands so entered had been withdrawn or classified 'together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same.' The lands here in question when entered were within the terms of the executive order of 1910, by which order they were 'withdrawn from settlement, location, sale or entry, and reserved for classification ....' Whether a 'classification' of the lands was effected by the order we need not determine, since it is clear that they were 'withdrawn' by the definite and unambiguous words of the order; and, as shown by the bill, it is enough to exclude complainant from the privileges of the act of 1920 that the lands were either withdrawn or classified. It follows that the motion to dismiss on the first ground stated was well taken and should have been granted and the case ended without a hearing, which the district court unnecessarily ordered-evidently out of abundance of caution.\n Since, plainly, the bill of complaint did not state a cause of action, the United States could have no interest in the case requiring its presence as a party; and the inquiry as to whether it was an indispensable party, which would have been entirely proper under a good bill, was here wholly gratuitous.\n The rule is that if the merits of the cause may be determined without prejudice to the rights of necessary parties, absent and beyond the jurisdiction of the court, it will be done; and a court of equity will strain hard to reach that result. West v. Randall, 2 Mason, 181, 196, Fed. Cas.No.17,424 (opinion by Mr. Justice Story); Cole Silver Mining Co. v. Virginia & G.H.W. Co., 1 Sawy, 685, 689, Fed.Cas.No.2,990 (opinion by Mr. Justice Field); Story's Equity indispensable is that, since the bill states Russell v. Clark's Executors, 7 Cranch, 69, 98; Elmendorf v. Taylor, 10 Wheat. 152, 167, 168. Cf. Equity Rule 39 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723). \n\n[299 U.S. 65, 71]\n\u00a0\n We refer to the rule established by these authorities because it illustrates the diligence with which courts of equity will seek a way to adjudicate the merits of a case in the absence of interested parties that cannot be brought in. While the rule as stated is intended for the benefit of a plaintiff whose bill sets forth a cause of action which he should, if possible, be given an opportunity to prove, the principle it embodies applies with equal, if not greater, reason to a case like this where the bill entirely fails to do so. In such a case, the obvious reply of the court to a suggestion that other parties are indispensable is tht, since the bill states no cause of action against any one, the rights of absent parties are in no way threatened by it, and to enter upon a consideration of the question of their indispensability would be a vain waste of time.\n If it be urged that the United States is an indispensable party, and hence that the court may not proceed even to inquire whether the bill states a cause of action, the answer is that good sense suggests precisely the contrary. For a mere inspection of the bill at once discloses that it states no cause of action and, therefore, the United States is not an indispensable party, since it cannot be prejudiced by, and has no interest requiring protection in, a proceeding which at the threshhold is seen to be without substance. Nothing is to be gained by an inquiry into the status of absent parties when it is certain upon the face of complainant's bill that in no event will he be entitled to a decree in his favor.\n We are of opinion that the Court of Appeals should have disposed of the case in accordance with that view; and that the District Court should have dismissed the bill upon the first ground stated in respondent's motion. Upon the question whether, upon a good bill, the United States would be an indispensable party, we deem it unnecessary to express an opinion. \n\n[299 U.S. 65, 72]\n\u00a0\n The decrees of both courts below must, therefore, be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with directions to enter a decree in accordance with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRITISH-AMERICAN OIL PRODUCING CO. v.

Nagle, both of Helena, Mont., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana sustaining state taxes on the production of oil and gas under a lease covering such minerals in certain lands of the Blackfeet Indians (101 Mont. 293, 54 P.(2d) 129) is here under review.\n These Indians are wards of the United States and have been occupying a reservation in Montana. During recent years they have received allotments in severalty from lands in the reservation, and they now hold the allotments under so-called trust patents, whereby the United States declares that it will retain the title for a period of twenty- \n\n[299 U.S. 159, 161]\n\u00a0\n -five years in trust for the use and benefit of the several allottees, and at the expiration of that period will convey the same by patent to them or their heirs. Under the terms of the controlling statute, as also under the terms of the patents, all minerals, including coal, oil, and gas, in or under the allotted lands are reserved to the United States for the benefit of the tribe 'until Congress shall otherwise direct.'\n The petitioner holds a mining lease covering 'all the oil and gas deposits in or under' certain of these allotted lands a stated share of the gross production being reserved to the United States for the benefit of the Indian Tribe as the lessor's royalty. The lease was authorized by a resolution of the tribal council, was recommended by the United States agent in charge of the reservation, was given for a term of five years from the date of its approval, was approved by the Secretary of the Interior October 5, 1934, and recites that it was given in accordance with section 3 of the Act of February 28, 1891, c. 383, 26 Stat. 795 (25 U.S.C. A.  397), as amended by Act of May 29, 1924, c. 210, 43 Stat. 244 (25 U.S. C.A.  398).\n The taxes in question are a gross production tax and a net proceeds tax, and it is conceded that the State is without power to apply either to the production under this lease, save and except as Congress may have given its assent. Whether Congress has given its assent is the ultimate question, and this turns on the subordinate questions (a) which of several statutes controls the leasing of tribal lands in this reservation for mining oil and gas, and (b) whether the reserved oil and gas deposits underlying allotted lands in this reservation constitute unallotted lands in the sense of these statutes.\n There have been two related but distinct lines of legislation respecting the leasing of tribal Indian lands for mining purposes. The older and more general line has been regarded uniformly as including lands in reserva- \n\n[299 U.S. 159, 162]\n\u00a0\n tions created by legislation, such as a treaty or congressional enactment; and has also been regarded at times as including, and at other times as excluding, lands in a reservation created by Executive Order. The proviso to section 3 of the Act of February 28, 1891, and the Act of May 29, 1924, both before mentioned, belong of the first line. The later and narrower line, which doubtless was prompted by diverse administrative interpretations of the other, is in terms confined to lands in reservations created by Executive Order. The Act of March 3, 1927, c. 299, 44 Stat. 1347 (25 U.S.C.A.  398a to 398e), belongs to this line.\n We are of opinion, as was the state court, that the Blackfeet reservation, as existing in recent years, was created by legislation and not by Executive Order.\n The original territory of the Blackfeet and other Indians associated with them included a large area, as is shown by a treaty of September 17, 1851, 2 Kappler Indian Affairs (2d Ed.) 594, and a treaty of October 17, 1855, 11 Stat. 657. Under Executive Orders of 1873 and 1874, an Act of Congress of April 15, 1874, c. 96, 18 Stat. 28, and Executive Orders of 1875 and 1880, the Blackfeet and certain of the other Indians associated with them came to occupy a large part of this original territory as a reservation specially set apart for them.\n By an agreement or convention, ratified by Congress May 1, 1888, c. 213, 25 Stat. 113, which recited various considerations moving from the Blackfeet to the United States and the reverse, and from the Blackfeet to their associates and the reverse, much of the earlier reservation was ceded to the United States, and three separate reservations, all within the limits of the earlier reservation, were created, one of these being set apart for the Blackfeet and the other two for the other Indians. By another agreement or convention, ratified by Congress June 10, 1896, c. 398, 29 Stat. 321, 353, which disclosed various considerations moving from the Indians to the government and the reverse, part of the separate Blackfeet \n\n[299 U.S. 159, 163]\n\u00a0\n reservation was ceded to the United States, and the remainder was set apart as the tribe's future reservation. This last reservation is the one with which we now are concerned It rests entirely on the agreements or conventions which were ratified and given effect by Congress. The Executive Orders before mentioned, evidently designed to be temporary, have been superseded by congressional action and no longer are of any force.\n We turn, therefore, to the legislation bearing on the leasing for mining purposes of tribal lands in such a reservation. We say 'tribal lands' because (1) here the mineral deposits did not pass to the allottees but were reserved for the benefit of the tribe, and (2) other and distinct legislation controls the leasing for mining purposes of lands of individual allottees where there is no reservation of the mineral deposits.\n The proviso to section 3 of the Act of February 28, 1891 (25 U.S.C.A .  397), reads:\n'Where lands are occupied by Indians who have bought and paid for the same, and which lands are not needed for farming or agricultural purposes, and are not desired for individual allotments, the same may be leased by authority of the council speaking for such Indians, for a period not to exceed ... ten years for mining purposes in such quantities and upon such terms and conditions as the agent in charge of such reservation may recommend, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n The Act of May 29, 1924 (25 U.S.C.A.  398), provides that 'unallotted land on Indian reservations,' other than lands of the Five Civilized Tribes and of the Osage Reservation, which are subject to lease for mining purposes under the abovequoted proviso, 'may be leased at public auction by the Secretary of the Interior, with the consent of the council speaking for such Indians, for oil and gas mining purposes for a period of not to exceed ten years, and as much longer \n\n[299 U.S. 159, 164]\n\u00a0\n thereafter as oil or gas shall be found in paying quantities: ... Provided, that the production of oil and gas and other minerals on such lands may be taxed by the State in which said lands are located in all respects the same as production on unrestricted lands, and the Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to cause to be paid the tax so assessed against the royalty interests on said lands: Provided, however, That such tax shall not become a lien or charge of any kind or character against the land or the property of the Indian owner.'\n The present lease recites that it was given under these general provisions, and the state court regarded them as both applicable and controlling.\n The petitioner does not question that the reservation, as existing and occupied by the tribe in recent years, comes within the terms of the proviso in the Act of 1891 as lands which the Indians 'have bought and paid for.' Doubtless this is because the petitioner recognizes that by uniform administrative practice and by judicial decision this part of the proviso has been construed as not confined to lands acquired by Indians through the payment of a consideration in money, but equally including lands reserved for Indians in return for a cession or surrender by them of other lands, possessions, or rights. \n1\n Further comment in this regard is not necessary.\n Obviously the mineral deposits which are the subject of the lease are not needed for farming or agricultural purposes and are not desired for individual allotments.\n The issue of the trust patents containing, at the statute requires, a reservation for the benefit of the tribe of all minerals, including oil and gas, in or under the allotted land, operates to carve out of such land and create a distinct estate consisting of the minerals. This estate is in \n\n[299 U.S. 159, 165]\n\u00a0\n itself land, and, being reserved for the benefit of the tribe, it is tribal land, and is unallotted.\n What has been said, unless deflected by matters which remain to be noticed, shows, we think, that the reserved mineral estate which is the subject of the lease comes in all particulars within the terms of the general provisions before quoted, and that the lease should be regarded as authorized by that legislation and given under it.\n But it is urged that there are other provisions specifically dealing with the leasing of the Blackfeet lands for mining purposes and that these provisions fully cover that field and therefore render the general legislation inapplicable. There are provisions expressly relating to such leasing of these lands, and therefore it becomes necessary to consider their scope and effect.\n The Act of June 30, 1919, c. 4, 41 Stat. 3, 16, 17, contains the following:\n'The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to make allotments under existing laws within the said reservation to any Indians of said Blackfeet Tribe not heretofore allotted. ...\n\n'Provided further, That any and all minerals, including coal, oil, and gas, are hereby reserved for the benefit of the Blackfeet Tribe of Indians until Congress shall otherwise direct, and patents hereafter issued shall contain a reservation accordingly: Provided, That the lands containing said minerals may be leased under such rules and regulations and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe.' Section 10.\n\n The Act of September 20, 1922, c. 347, 42 Stat. 857 (25 U.S.C.A.  400), also provides that 'lands reserved for school and agency purposes and all other unallotted lands on the Fort Peck and Blackfeet Indian Reservations, in the State of Montana, reserved from allotment or other disposition, may be leased for mining purposes under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.' \n\n[299 U.S. 159, 166]\n\u00a0\n It is to be observed that the administration of these special provisions and of the general provisions is committed to the supervision of the same officer-the Secretary of the Interior-and that in the exercise of this supervision he approved the present lease containing a recital that it was given in accordance with the general provisions. Not only so, but the agent in charge of the reservation recommended the lease, and the lessee accepted it, with that recital of its statutory fundation. In other words, all proceed with the view that the general provisions are applicable, and not excluded by the special provisions.\n We are of opinion that this view is right. The special provisions relate to the same subject that is dealt with in the general provisions and are to be read in the light of the latter. All were in force when the lease was given and all should be treated as one law so far as this reasonably can be done. 2 The general provisions are more comprehensive than the special. The latter are meager and wanting in detail. The general provisions supply what is thus wanting. And, so far as is here material, there is no conflict, nor anything to prevent all from being carried into effect as if they were one law.\n We conclude that the least was given under the special provision in the Act of June 30, 1919, taken in connection with the general provisions. The Act of May 29, 1924 (25 U.S.C.A.  398), is one of the general provisions, and in it Congress assents to taxation by the State of the production of oil and gas through a lease given under its provisions.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 25 Land Dec. 408; Strawberry Valley Cattle Co. v.

IRVING TRUST CO.(1936)\nNo. 232\nArgued: December 13, 1935Decided: February 10, 1936\n\n\n\n Mr. M. H. Goldstein, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles A. Houston, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n J. R. Palmenberg Sons, Inc., was adjudged bankrupt in the Federal Court for Southern New York in August, 1933. In September, Bronx Brass Foundry, Inc., filed its proof of claim. In January, 1934, the Irving Trust Company, trustee in bankruptcy, moved to expunge the claim on the ground that the creditor had received, within the four months preceding the bankruptcy, payments on ac- \n\n[297 U.S. 230, 231]\n\u00a0\n count aggregating $1,000 which were unlawful preferences. The creditor denied the allegations of preference.\n On the issue thus raised, several hearings were had before the referee and the evidence introduced clearly indicated that the payments would, upon bankruptcy, effect a preference over other creditors of the same class, and that the claimant had received them having reasonable cause to believe the debtor insolvent. But it left uncertain whether the amount received was more than its pro rata share would have been, if the then existing assets had been ratably distributed among all the then creditors. Before the hearing closed, and in view of an adverse ruling on the admission of evidence, the creditor filed a withdrawal of its claim and left the hearing.\n The trustee objected to allowance of the withdrawal, and introduced further evidence, insisting that it was entitled to an adjudication of the question whether the payments made were unlawful preferences. The referee, at the close of the hearing, ordered that the claim be expunged, unless the creditor within 20 days repay the preference to the trustee, with interest from the date of service of the motion to expunge. He said: 'When a creditor files a claim against the bankrupt estate he elects a forum which may hear and determine whether a preference to him was made. Although judgment of recovery may not be granted, the finding thereon, subject to review, is conclusive as between the parties. It is not intended that a party shall have two trials of the same issue or be permitted to present the same issue to different tribunals for determination. When ssue is joined upon the question whether a voidable preference has been received, the creditor may not withdraw of his own motion and thereby avoid such determination as the proof warrants.'\n The District Court approved the order of the referee. Its judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Ap- \n\n[297 U.S. 230, 232]\n\u00a0\n peals, which held that the creditor had received a preference although the proof did not show that at the times of the payments the assets of the debtor were insufficient to pay proportional amounts to all the other creditors, In re J. R. Palmenberg Sons, 76 F.(2d) 935. We granted certiorari, \n296 \nU.S. 565\n, 56 S.Ct. 117, because the ruling on the right of the creditor to withdraw its claim appeared to conflict with Scholl Mfg. Co. v. Rodgers, 51 F.(2d) 971, decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit; and because the ruling on the question of preference conflicted with W. S. Peck & Co. v. Whitmer, 231 F. 893, also decided by that court.\n First. The referee was justified in refusing to permit the creditor to withdraw its claim. The Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that ordinarily a plaintiff in equity has, as stated in Ex parte Skinner & Eddy Corporation, \n265 \nU.S. 86, 93\n, 44 S.Ct. 446, the absolute right to dismiss his bill. Its approval of the referee's refusal to permit the creditor to withdraw rested on the ground that the District Court had adopted a rule which authorized the court to refuse, after issue joined, 'to permit the plaintiff to discontinue even though the defendant cannot have affirmative relief under the pleadings and though his only prejudice be the vexation and expense of a possible second suit upon the same cause of action'; that this modification of the right of voluntary discontinuance was within the judicial power, since it dealt with procedure; that the rule had been approved by the Circuit Court of Appeals; that it was applicable also to bankruptcy proceedings; and that it had been properly applied below. We agree with the reasoning and the conclusion reached.\n Second. The ruling of the referee on the question of preference was correct for the reasons stated in Palmer Clay Products Co. v. Brown, \n297 \nU.S. 227\n, 56 S.Ct. 450, decided this day.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWN v.

Morgan Stevens, both of Jackson, Miss., for petitioners.\n Messrs. W. D. Conn, of Corinth, Miss., and W. H. Maynard, of Baltimore, Md., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether convictions, which rest solely upon confessions shown to have been extorted by officers of the state by brutality and violence, are consistent with the due process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n Petitioners were indicted for the murder of one Raymond Stewart, whose death occurred on March 30, 1934. They were indicted on April 4, 1934, and were then arraigned and pleaded not guilty. Counsel were appointed by the court to defend them. Trial was begun the next morning and was concluded on the following day, when they were found guilty and sentenced to death.\n Aside from the confessions, there was no evidence sufficient to warrant the submission of the case to the jury. After a preliminary inquiry, testimony as to the confessions was received over the objection of defendants' counsel. Defendants then testified that the confessions were false and had been procured by physical torture. The case went to the jury with instructions, upon the request of defendants' counsel, that if the jury had reasonable doubt as to the confessions having resulted from coercion, and that they were not they were not to be considered as evidence. On their to the Su- \n\n[297 U.S. 278, 280]\n\u00a0\n preme Court of the State, defendants assigned as error the inadmissibility of the confessions. The judgment was affirmed. 158 So. 339.\n Defendants then moved in the Supreme Court of the State to arrest the judgment and for a new trial on the ground that all the evidence against them was obtained by coercion and brutality known to the court and to the district attorney, and that defendants had been denied the benefit of counsel or opportunity to confer with counsel in a reasonable manner. The motion was supported by affidavits. At about the same time, defendants filed in the Supreme Court a 'suggestion of error' explicitly challenging the proceedings of the trial, in the use of the confessions and with respect to the alleged denial of representation by counsel, as violating the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The state court entertained the suggestion of error, considered the federal question, and decided it against defendants' contentions. 161 So. 465. Two judges dissented. 161 So. 470. We granted a writ of certiorari. \n296 \nU.S. 559\n, 56 S.Ct. 128.\n The grounds of the decision were (1) that immunity from self- incrimination is not essential to due process of law; and (2) that the failure of the trial court to exclude the confessions after the introduction of evidence showing their incompetency, in the absence of a request for such exclusion, did not deprive the defendants of life or liberty without due process of law; and that even if the trial court had erroneously overruled a motion to exclude the confessions, the ruling would have been mere error reversible on appeal, but not a violation of constitution right. 161 So. 465, at page 468.\n The opinion of the state court did not set forth the evidence as to the circumstances in which the confessions were procured. That the evidence established that they were procured by coercion was not questioned. The state \n\n[297 U.S. 278, 281]\n\u00a0\n court said: 'After the state closed its case on the merits, the appellants, for the first time, introduced evidence from which it appears that the confessions were not made voluntarily but were coerced.' 161 So. 465, at page 466. There is no dispute as to the facts upon this point, and as they are clearly and adequately stated in the dissenting opinion of Judge Griffith (with whom Judge Anderson concurred), showing both the extreme brutality of the measures to extort the confessions and the participation of the state authorities, we quote this part of his opinion in full, as follows (161 So. 465, at pages 470, 471):\n'The crime with which these defendants, all ignorant negroes, are charged, was discovered about 1 o'clock p.m. on Friday, March 30, 1934. On that night one Dial, a deputy sheriff, accompanied by others, came to the home of Ellington, one of the defendants, and requested him to accompany them to the house of the deceased, and there a number of white men were gathered, who began to accuse the defendant of the crime. Upon his denial they seized him, and with the participation of the deputy they hanged him by a rope to the limb of a tree, and, having let him down, they hung him again, and when he was let down the second time, and he still protested his innocence, he was tied to a tree and whipped, and, still declining to accede to the demands that he confess, he was finally released, and he returned with some difficulty to his home, suffering intense pain and agony. The record of the testimony shows that the signs of the rope on his neck were plainly visible during the so-called trial. A day or two thereafter the said deputy, accompanied by another, returned to the home of the said defendant and arrested him, and departed with the prisoner towards the jail in an adjoining county, but went by a route which led into the state of Alabama; and while on the way, in that state, the deputy stopped and again severely whipped the defendant, declaring that he would continue the whipping \n\n[297 U.S. 278, 282]\n\u00a0\n until he confessed, and the defendant then agreed to confess to such a statement as the deputy would dictate, and he did so, after which he was delivered to jail.\n\n'The other two defendants, Ed Brown and Henry Shields, were also arrested and taken to the same jail. On Sunday night, April 1, 1934, the same deputy, accompanied by a number of white men, one of whom was also an officer, and by the jailer, came to the jail, and the two last named defendants were made to strip and they were laid over chairs and their backs were cut to pieces with a leather strap with buckles on it, and they were likewise made by the said deputy definitely to understand that the whipping would be continued unless and until they confessed, and not only confessed, but confessed in every matter of detail as demanded by those present; and in this manner the defendants confessed he crime, and, as the whippings progressed and were repeated, they changed or adjusted their confession in all particulars of detail so as to conform to the demands of their torturers. When the confessions had been obtained in the exact form and contents as desired by the mob, they left with the parting admonition and warning that, if the defendants changed their story at any time in any respect from that last stated, the perpetrators of the outrage would administer the same or equally effective treatment.\n\n'Further details of the brutal treatment to which these helpless prisoners were subjected need not be pursued. It is sufficient to say that in pertinent respects the transcript reads more like pages torn from some medieval account than a record made within the confines of a modern civilization which aspires to an enlightened constitutional government.\n\n'All this having been accomplished, on the next day, that is, on Monday, April 2, when the defendants had been given time to recuperate somewhat from the tortures to which they had been subjected, the two sheriffs, one \n\n[297 U.S. 278, 283]\n\u00a0\n of the county where the crime was committed, and the other of the county of the jail in which the prisoners were confined, came to the jail, accompanied by eight other persons, some of them deputies, there to hear the free and voluntary confession of these miserable and abject defendants. The sheriff of the county of the crime admitted that he had heard of the whipping, but averred that he had no personal knowledge of it. He admitted that one of the defendants, when brought before him to confess, was limping and did not sit down, and that this particular defendant then and there stated that he had been strapped so severely that he could not sit down, and, as already stated, the signs of the rope on the neck of another of the defendants were plainly visible to all. Nevertheless the solemn farce of hearing the free and voluntary confessions was gone through with, and these two sheriffs and one other person then present were the three witnesses used in court to establish the so-called confessions, which were received by the court and admitted in evidence over the objections of the defendants duly entered of record as each of the said three witnesses delivered their alleged testimony. There was thus enough before the court when these confessions were first offered to make known to the court that they were not, beyond all reasonable doubt, free and voluntary; and the failure of the court then to exclude the confessions is sufficient to reverse the judgment, under every rule of procedure that has heretofore been prescribed, and hence it was not necessary subsequently to renew the objections by motion or otherwise.\n\n'The spurious confessions having been obtained-and the farce last mentioned having been gone through with on Monday, April 2d-the court, then in session, on the following day, Tuesday, April 3, 1934, ordered the grand jury to reassemble on the succeeding day, April 4, 1934, at 9 o'clock, and on the morning of the day last men- \n\n[297 U.S. 278, 284]\n\u00a0\n tioned the grand jury returned an indictment against the defendants for murder. Late that afternoon the defendants were brought from the jail in the adjoining county and arraigned, when one or more of them offered to plead guilty, which the court declined to accept, and, upon inquiry whether they had or desired counsel, they stated that they had none, and did not suppose that counsel could be of any assistance to them. The court thereupon appointed counsel, and set the case for trial for the following morning at 9 o'clock, and the defendants were returned to the jail in the adjoining county about thirty miles away.\n\n'The defendants were brought to the courthouse of the county on the following morning, April 5th, and the so-called trial was opened, and was concluded on the next day, April 6, 1934, and resulted in a pretended conviction with death sentences. The evidence upon which the conviction was obtained was the so-called confessions. Without this e idence, a peremptory instruction to find for the defendants would have been inescapable. The defendants were put on the stand, and by their testimony the facts and the details thereof as to the manner by which the confessions were extorted from them were fully developed, and it is further disclosed by the record that the same deputy, Dial, under whose guiding hand and active participation the tortures to coerce the confessions were administered, was actively in the performance of the supposed duties of a court deputy in the courthouse and in the presence of the prisoners during what is denominated, in complimentary terms, the trial of these defendants. This deputy was put on the stand by the state in rebuttal, and admitted the whippings. It is interesting to note that in his testimony with reference to the whipping of the defendant Ellington, and in response to the inquiry as to how severely he was whipped, the deputy stated, 'Not too much for a negro; not as much as I would have done if it were left to me.' Two others who had participated \n\n[297 U.S. 278, 285]\n\u00a0\n in these whippings were introduced and admitted it-not a single witness was introduced who denied it. The facts are not only undisputed, they are admitted, and admitted to have been done by officers of the state, in conjunction with other participants, and all this was definitely well known to everybody connected with the trial, and during the trial, including the state's prosecuting attorney and the trial judge presiding.'\n\n\n 1. \nThe state stresses the statement in Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 114\n, 29 S.Ct. 14, 26, that 'exemption from compulsory self-incrimination in the courts of the states is not secured by any part of the Federal Constitution,' and the statement in Snyder v. Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 105\n, 54 S.Ct. 330, 332, 90 A.L.R. 575, that 'the privilege against self-incrimination may be withdrawn and the accused put upon the stand as a witness for the state.' But the question of the right of the state to withdraw the privilege against self-incrimination is not here involved. The compulsion to which the quoted statements refer is that of the processes of justice by which the accused may be called as a witness and required to testify. Compulsion by torture to extort a confession is a different matter.\n The state is free to regulate the procedure of its courts in accordance with its own conceptions of policy, unless in so doing it 'offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' Snyder v. Massachusetts, supra; Rogers v. Peck, \n199 \nU.S. 425, 434\n, 26 S.Ct. 87. The state may abolish trial by jury. It may dispense with indictment by a grand jury and substitute complaint or information. Walker v. Sauvinet, \n92 U.S. 90\n; Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516\n, 4 S.Ct. 111, 292; Snyder v. Massachusetts, supra. But the freedom of the state in establishing its policy is the freedom of constitutional government and is limited by the requirement of due process of law. Because a state may dispense with a jury trial, it does not follow that it may substitute trial by ordeal. The rack and tor- \n\n[297 U.S. 278, 286]\n\u00a0\n ture chamber may not be substituted for the witness stand. The state may not permit an accused to be hurried to conviction under mob domination- where the whole proceeding is but a mask-without supplying corrective process. Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86, 91\n, 43 S.Ct. 265. The state may not deny to the accused the aid of counsel. Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527. Nor may a state, through the action of its officers, contrive a conviction through the pretense of a trial which in truth is 'but used as a means of depriving a defendant of liberty through a deliberate deception of court and jury by the presentation of testimony known to be perjured.' Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103, 112\n, 55 S.Ct. 340, 342, 98 A.L.R. 406. And t e trial equally is a mere pretense where the state authorities have contrived a conviction resting solely upon confessions obtained by violence. The due process clause requires 'that state action, whether through one agency or another, shall be consistent with the fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions.' Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S. Ct. 103, 104, 48 A.L.R. 1102. It would be difficult to conceive of methods more revolting to the sense of justice than those taken to procure the confessions of these petitioners, and the use of the confessions thus obtained as the basis for conviction and sentence was a clear denial of due process.\n\n 2. \nIt is in this view that the further contention of the State must be considered. That contention rests upon the failure of counsel for the accused, who had objected to the admissibility of the confessions, to move for their exclusion after they had been introduced and the fact of coercion had been proved. It is a contention which proceeds upon a misconception of the nature of petitioners' complaint. That complaint is not of the commission of mere error, but of a wrong so fundamental that it made the whole proceeding a mere pretense of a trial and rendered the conviction and sentence wholly void. Moore v. Dempsey, supra. We are not concerned with a mere \n\n[297 U.S. 278, 287]\n\u00a0\n question of state practice, or whether counsel assigned to petitioners were competent or mistakenly assumed that their first objections were sufficient. In an earlier case the Supreme Court of the State had recognized the duty of the court to supply corrective process where due process of law had been denied. In Fisher v. State, 145 Miss. 116, 134, 110 So. 361, 365, the court said: 'Coercing the supposed state's criminals into confessions and using such confessions so coerced from them against them in trials has been the curse of all countries. It was the chief iniquity, the crowning infamy of the Star Chamber, and the Inquisition, and other similar institutions. The Constitution recognized the evils that lay behind these practices and prohibited them in this country. ... The duty of maintaining constitutional rights of a person on trial for his life rises above mere rules of procedure, and wherever the court is clearly satisfied that such violations exist, it will refuse to sanction such violations and will apply the corrective.'\n In the instant case, the trial court was fully advised by the undisputed evidence of the way in which the confessions had been procured. The trial court knew that there was no other evidence upon which conviction and sentence could be based. Yet it proceeded to permit conviction and to pronounce sentence. The conviction and sentence were void for want of the essential elements of due process, and the proceeding thus vitiated could be challenged in any appropriate manner. Mooney v. Holohan, supra. It was challenged before the Supreme Court of the State by the express invocation of the Fourteenth Amendment. That court entertained the challenge, considered the federal question thus presented, but declined to enforce petitioners' constitutional right. The court thus denied a federal right fully established and specially set up and claimed, and the judgment must be reversed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCALLAGHAN v. RECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORPORATION(1936)\nNo. 539\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 464, 465]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Percival E. Jackson, of New York City, for petitioners Callaghan and others.\n Mr. Theodore Stitt, of Brooklyn, N.Y., pro se.\n Eli W. Debevoise, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Nos. 539, 540.\n In these cases certiorari was granted, \n296 \nU.S. 570\n, 56 S.Ct. 307, because of the public impo tance of the questions involved, to review the interpretation by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, In re Allied Owners Corp., 79 F.(2d) 187, of the provisions of section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  207) govering allowances to trustees and referees in bankruptcy for their services in bankruptcy proceedings when superseded by reorganization proceedings under that section. No 539, which relates to the allowances of the trustees in bankruptcy, and No. 540, which relates to the compensation of the referee in bankruptcy, will be separately considered. \n No. 539.\n Allowances to Trustees in Bankruptcy.\n Petitioners were trustees in a bankruptcy proceeding which was superseded by a proceeding to reorganize the debtor under section 77B, 11 U.S.C.A.  207. The referee in bankruptcy fixed their compensation at $60, 000, which the District Judge \n\n[297 U.S. 464, 466]\n\u00a0\n sitting in bankruptcy increased to $90,000. The same judge sitting in the reorganization proceeding ordered payment of this allowance. The Court of Appeals reduced it to $14,628.50, computed, as provided by section 48a and 48e of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  76(a, e) upon the basis of cash disbursed by them. It held that section 77B(i), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(i), requires that allowances to trustees, for their services in the bankruptcy proceeding, be fixed in conformity to section 48 (11 U.S.C.A.  76), and that the reorganization court, in so far as it finds them reasonable, direct their payment from the property of the debtor.\n Section 77B(i) provides: 'If a receiver or trustee of ... the property of a corporation has been appointed by a Federal, State, or Territorial court,' and appropriate proceedings for a reorganization are afterward had under section 77B, the trustee or receiver appointed in the reorganization proceedings, or the debtor if no trustee is appointed, 'shall be entitled forthwith to possession of (such property) and vested with title,' and, 'the judge shall make such orders as he may deem equitable for the protection of obligations incurred by the receiver or prior trustee and for the payment of such reasonable administrative expenses and allowances in the prior proceeding as may be fixed by the court appointing aid receiver or prior trustee.'\n It is the contention of petitioners that section 77B(i), when bankruptcy is superseded by reorganization, authorizes the bankruptcy court to fix reasonable allowances for trustee's services, unrestricted by section 48 or other provision of the Bankruptcy Act, and that it requires payment of the allowances thus fixed except that the reorganization court may reduce them if it finds them excessive.\n Petitioners thus construe 77B(i) as substituting the test of reasonableness for all other statutory restrictions upon the authority of the prior court to compensate trustees, a result which is reached by reading 'reasonable' as \n\n[297 U.S. 464, 467]\n\u00a0\n qualifying the authority to fix compensation given by section 77B(i) to the appointing court. They argue that section 48 was intended only to apply to bankruptcies in which liquidation results; that when, because of the intervening reorganization proceeding, liquidation does not result, section 77B(i) makes a new grant of power to the court appointing the trustee to fix reasonable allowances without reference to the limitations of section 48; that the interpretation of the court below is inadmissible because of the hardship of inadequate allowances which would ensue in some instances if it were accepted.\n We think these arguments ignore the words of section 77B(i), the policy disclosed by its legislative history, and the policy as well of the Bankruptcy Act, of which it is an integral part. It is the judge in the reorganization proceeding who is to order payment of such reasonable administrative expenses and allowances in the prior proceeding as may be fixed by the court appointing the 'prior trustee.' Plainly the word 'reasonable' seems designed, by qualifying the action of the judge ordering the payment, to enable him to require tha allowances, which the statute permits the prior judge to fix, shall not exceed the limit of reasonableness. Compare Taylor v. Sternberg, \n293 \nU.S. 470\n, 55 S.Ct. 260; Gross v. Irving Trust Co., \n289 \nU.S. 342\n, 53 S.Ct. 605, 90 A.L.R. 1215; Hume v. Myers (C.C.A.) 242 F. 827. Only by a strained construction can it be read as a new grant of power to the latter, by qualifying his action and impliedly relieving him of existing limitations upon his authority to make allowances for services rendered by officers of his own court.\n That such a grant of power was not intended is evident from the fact that the section applies to the administrative expenses incurred in state court proceedings as well as in bankruptcy. It would require compelling language to justify the conclusion that Congress has undertaken to enlarge or alter the powers of state courts to fix allow- \n\n[297 U.S. 464, 468]\n\u00a0\n ances for their own administrative expenses because payment of them is to be effected by a federal court to which the proceeding has been transferred.\n In interpreting the section, it is of importance that it is a part of the Bankruptcy Act, to be read with the other sections relating to allowances, and that the allowances are compensation for officers of the court and for expenses incurred in the course of a judicial proceeding conducted for the purpose, among others, of protecting the interests of creditors in the debtor's property. Trustees in bankruptcy are public officers and officers of a court, and the officers of a court, like public officers generally must show clear warrant of law before compensation will be owing to them for the performance of their public duties. Realty Associates Securities Corp. v. O'Connor, \n295 \nU.S. 295, 299\n, 55 S.Ct. 663\n\n\n It has been the consistent policy of Congress that proceedings in bankruptcy and under section 77B be economically administered. This is evidenced by explicit limitations in sections 40, 48, of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  68, 76), on fees of referees, trustees, and receivers. To exact strict compliance with these sections, section 72 (11 U.S.C.A.  112) commands: 'Neither the referee, receiver, marshal, nor trustee shall in any form or guise receive, nor shall the court allow him, any other or further compensation for his services than that expressly authorized and prescribed in this Act (title).' In recognition of this policy, the limitations upon expenses prescribed by sections 40, 48, have been strictly construed, even when the compensation allowed was, in special circumstances, materially less than that which otherwise might have been considered reasonable. See Realty Associates Securities Corp. v. O'Connor, supra; In re Detroit Mortgage Corporation (C.C.A.) 12 F.(2d) 889; American Surety Co. v. Freed (C.C.A.) 224 F. 333. Compare In re Consolidated Distributors, Inc. (C.C.A.) 298 F. 859; In re Curtis (C.C.A.) 100 F. 784, 792. Occasional hardship to the individual is a consideration outweighed by the public interest and the declared policy of Congress. \n\n[297 U.S. 464, 469]\n\u00a0\n One of the controlling reasons for the enactment of section 77B was the desire to reduce the cost of reorganization. See Continental Illinois National Bank v. Chicago, R.I. & P.R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 685\n, 55 S.Ct. 595; Report No. 194, House Judiciary Committee, June 2, 1933, 73d Cong., 1st Sess.; Report No. 482, Senate Judiciary Committee, March 15, 1934, 73d Cong. 2d Sess. Section 76a, 11 U.S.C.A., enacted at the same time as section 77B, Bankr.Act, provides: 'The compensation allowed a ... trustee shall in no case be excessive or exorbitant, and the court in fixing such compensation shall have in mind the conservation and preservation of the estate of the bankrupt and the interests of the creditors therein.' Where the attempted reorganization results in liquidation, sections 40, 48, regulating the fees of referees, receivers and trustees in bankruptcy, are incorporated by reference in section 77B(k ), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(k), and are likewise made to control the fees of such officers in the reorganization proceedings.\n In all this we find convincing evidence that the settled policy of the Bankruptcy Act and its specific restrictions upon the allowances to officers were not to be disturbed by the inclusion, in a new provision for the transformation of an insolvency proceeding into one for reorganization, of permission to the judge in the former to fix allowances. Only amendatory language plainly indicating a purpose of disregard the restrictions of sections 40, 48, would justify a different conclusion.\n No. 540. Allowances to the Referee in Bankruptcy.\n Petitioner was the referee in the proceeding in bankruptcy which was superseded by the reorganization proceeding. The District Judge allowed him $25,000 for his services in the bankruptcy proceeding, and the same judge, sitting in the reorganization proceeding, ordered it paid. The Court of Appeals reduced the allowance to $1,038, computing it in accordance with section 40 of the Bankruptcy \n\n[297 U.S. 464, 470]\n\u00a0\n Act. As there had been no disbursement to creditors, the allowance was limited by section 40 to a filing fee and commissions on creditors' claims filed. Adopting the same comclusion which we have reached in No. 539, petitioner does not contend that section 77B(i) is authority for disregarding the limitations of the other sections of the Bankruptcy Act upon allowances for administration expenses. But he insists that reorganization under section 77B is a confirmation of a composition so that he is entitled to the allowance authorized by section 40a, 11 U.S.C.A .  68(a), of 'one-half of one per centum on the amount to be paid to creditors upon the confirmation of a composition.'\n He also relies on section 40c, 11 U.S.C.A.  68(c), which provides, 'In event of the reference of a case being invoked before it is concluded, and when the case is specially referred, the judge shall determine what part of the fee and commissions shall be paid to the referee.'\n In view of the requirement, already discussed, of strict construction of sections of the Bankruptcy Act fixing fees and allowances of officers, we think neither of the contentions of petitioner is admissible. Section 40 was enacted long before section 77B, when section 12 (11 U.S.C.A.  30), dealing eo nomine with compositions in bankruptcy, was a part of the act. Reorganizations now permitted under section 77B present certain resemblances to compositions under section 12 which have been commented upon as supporting the constitutionality of the reorganization provisions of section 77 or section 77B (11 U.S.C.A.  205 or 207). Continental Ill. Nat. Bank v. Chicago, R.I. & P.R. Co., supra; In re Central Funding Corp. ( C.C.A.) 75 F.(2d) 256; Campbell v. Alleghany Corp. (C.C.A.) 75 F.(2d) 947. But section 77B contemplates a procedure and results not permissible under section 12. Reorganizations are nowhere referred to in the statute as compositions. Section 77B(c)(11), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(c)(11), applies a different standard of compensation for the master appointed in a reorganization proceeding, with duties corresponding to those of a referee in bankruptcy, from \n\n[297 U.S. 464, 471]\n\u00a0\n that established by section 40. If reorganization is abandoned in favor of liquidation, a referee may be appointed to whose compensation section 40 is expressly made applicable by section 77B(k). These are persuasive reasons for concluding that neither section 40 nor section 77B is to be construed as recognizing that a reorganization is the equivalent of a composition for the purpose of fixing referees' fees under section 40a.\n Section 40c relates only to the allocation of fees allowed under section 40a in the event that the reference is revoked or the case is specially referred. But here the reference has not been revoked nor the case specially referred, and, for reasons already given, no fees to the referee in addition to those allowed by the court below are authorized under section 40a.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARTER v.

C. 824, 49 Stat. 991 (15 U.S.C.A.  801-827). The constitutional validity of the act is challenged in each of the suits.\n Nos. 636 and 651 are cross-writs of certiorari in a stockholder's suit, brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia by Carter against the Carter Coal Company and some of its officers, Guy T. Helvering ( Commissioner of Internal Revenue of the United \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 279]\n\u00a0\n States), and certain other officers of the United States, to enjoin the coal company and its officers named from filing an acceptance of the code provided for in said act, from paying any tax imposed upon the coal company under the authority of the act, and from complying with its provisions or the provisions f the code. The bill sought to enjoin the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the other federal officials named from proceeding under the act in particulars specified, the details of which it is unnecessary to state. \n No. 649\n is a suit brought in a federal District Court in Kentucky by petitioners against respondent collector of internal revenue for the district of Kentucky, to enjoin him from collecting or attempting to collect the taxes sought to be imposed upon them by the act, on the ground of its unconstitutionality.\n No. 650 is a stockholder's suit brought in the same court against the coal company and some of its officers, to secure a mandatory injunction against their refusal to accept and operate under the provisions of the Bituminous Coal Code prepared in pursuance of the act.\n By the terms of the act, every producer of bituminous coal within the United States is brought within its provisions.\n Section 1 (15 U.S.C.A.  801) is a detailed assertion of circumstances thought to justify the act. It declares that the mining and distribution of bituminous coal throughout the United States by the producer are affected with a national public interest; and that the service of such coal in relation to industrial activities, transportation facilities, health and comfort of the people, conservation by controlled production and economical mining and marketing, maintenance of just and rational relations between the public, owners, producers, and employees, the right of the public to constant and adequate supplies of coal at reasonable prices, and the general welfare of the Nation, \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 280]\n\u00a0\n require that the bituminous coal industry should be regulated as the act provides.\n Section 1 (15 U.S.C.A.  802), among other things, further declares that the production and distribution by producers of such coal bear upon and directly affect interstate commerce, and render regulation of production and distribution imperative for the protection of such commerce; that certain features connected with the production, distribution, and marketing have led to waste of the national coal resources, disorganization of interstate commerce in such coal, and burdening and obstructing interstate commerce therein; that practices prevailing in the production of such coal directly affect interstate commerce and require regulation for the protection of that commerce; and that the right of mine workers to organize and collectively bargain for wages, hours of labor, and conditions of employment should be guaranteed in order to prevent constant wage cutting and disparate labor costs detrimental to fair interstate competition, and in order to avoid obstructions to interstate commerce that recur in industrial disputes over labor relations at the mines. These declarations constitute not enactments of law, but legislative averments by way of inducement to the enactment which follows.\n The substantive legislation begins with section 2 (15 U.S.C.A.  803), which establishes in the Department of the Interior a National Bituminous Coal Commission, to be appointed and constituted as the section then specifically provides. Upon this commission is conferred the power to hear evidence and find facts upon which its orders and actions may be predicated.\n Section 3 (15 U.S.C.A.  804) provides:\n'There is hereby imposed upon the sale or other disposal of all bituminous coal produced within the United States an excise tax of 15 per centum on the sale price at the mine, or in the case of captive coal the fair market \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 281]\n\u00a0\n value of such coal at the mine, such tax, subject to the later provisions of this section, to be payable to the United States by the producers of such coal, and to be payable monthly for each calendar month, on or before the first business day of the second succeeding month, and under such regulations, and in such manner, as shall be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue: Provided, That in the case of captive coal produced as aforesaid, the Commissioner of Internal Revenu shall fix a price therefor at the current market price for the comparable kind, quality, and size of coals in the locality where the same is produced: Provided further, That any such coal producer who has filed with the National Bituminous Coal Commission his acceptance of the code provided for in section 4 of this Act (sections 805, 806, 807 and 808 of this chapter), and who acts in compliance with the provisions of such code, shall be entitled to a drawback in the form of a credit upon the amount of such tax payable hereunder, equivalent to 90 per centum of the amount of such tax, to be allowed and deducted therefrom at the time settlement therefor is required, in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Such right or benefit of drawback shall apply to all coal sold or disposed of from and after the day of the producer's filing with the Commission his acceptance of said code in such form of agreement as the Commission may prescribe. No producer shall by reason of his acceptance of the code provided for in section 4 (sections 805, 806, 807 and 808 of this chapter) or of the drawback of taxes provided in section 3 of this Act (this section) be held to be precluded or estopped from contesting the constitutionality of any provision of said code, or its validity as applicable to such producer.'\n\n Section 4 (15 U.S.C.A.  805 et seq.) provides that the commission shall formulate the elaborate provisions contained therein into a working agreement to be known as the Bituminous Coal Code. These provisions require the organization of twenty-three \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 282]\n\u00a0\n coal districts, each with a district board the membership of which is to be determined in a manner pointed out by the act. Minimum prices for coal are to be established by each of these boards, which is authorized to make such classification of coals and price variation as to mines and consuming market areas as it may deem proper. 'In order to sustain the stabilization of wages, working conditions, and maximum hours of labor, said prices shall be established so as to yield a return per net ton for each district in a minimum price area, as such districts are identified and such area is defined in the subjoined table designated 'Minimum-price area table,' equal as nearly as may be to the weighted average of the total costs, per net ton, determined as hereinafter provided, of the tonnage of such minimum price area. The computation of the total costs shall include the cost of labor, supplies, power, taxes, insurance, workmen's compensation, royalties, depreciation, and depletion (as determined by the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the computation of the Federal income tax) and all other direct expenses of production, coal operators' association dues, district board assessments for Board operating expenses only levied under the code, and reasonable costs of selling and the cost of administration.' ( 15 U.S.C.A.  807(a). The district board must determine and adjust the total cost of the ascertainable tonnage produced in the district so as to give effect to any changes in wage rates, hours of employment, or other factors substantially affecting costs, which may have been established since January 1, 1934\n\n\n Without repeating the long and involved provisions with regard to the fixing of minimum prices, it is enough to say that the act confers the power to fix the minimum price of coal at each and every coal mine in the United States, with such price variations as the board may deem necessary and proper. There is also a provision authorizing the commission, when deemed necessary in the public \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 283]\n\u00a0\n interest, to establish maximum prices in order to protect the consumer against unreasonably high prices.\n All sales and contracts for the sale of coal are subject to the code prices provided for and in effect when such sales and contracts are made. Various unfair methods of competition are defined and forbidden.\n The labor provisions of the code, found in part 3 of the same section ( 15 U.S.C.A.  808), require that in o der to effectuate the purposes of the act the district boards and code members shall accept specified conditions contained in the code, among which are the following:\n Employees to be given the right to organize and bargain collectively, through representatives of their own choosing, free from interference, restraint, or coercion of employers or their agents in respect of their concerted activities.\n Such employees to have the right of peaceable assemblage for the discussion of the principles of collective bargaining and to select their own check-weighman to inspect the weighing or measuring of coal.\n A labor board is created, consisting of three members, to be appointed by the President and assigned to the Department of Labor. Upon this board is conferred authority to adjudicate disputes arising under the provisions just stated, and to determine whether or not an organization of employees had been promoted, or is controlled or dominated by an employer in its organization, management, policy, or election of representatives. The board 'may order a code member to meet the representatives of its employees for the purpose of collective bargaining.'\n Subdivision (g) of part 3 (15 U.S.C.A.  808(g) provides:\n'Whenever the maximum daily and weekly hours of labor are agreed upon in any contract or contracts negotiated between the producers of more than two-thirds the annual national tonnage production for the \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 284]\n\u00a0\n preceding calendar year and the representatives of more than one-half the mine workers employed, such maximum hours of labor shall be accepted by all the code members. The wage agreement or agreements negotiated by collective bargaining in any district or group of two or more districts, between representatives of producers of more than two-thirds of the annual tonnage production of such district or each of such districts in a contracting group during the preceding calendar year, and representatives of the majority of the mine workers therein, shall be filed with the Labor Board and shall be accepted as the minimum wages for the various classifications of labor by the code members operating in such district or group of districts.'\n\n The bill of complaint in Nos. 636 and 651 was filed in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on August 31, 1935, the day after the Coal Conservation Act came into effect. That court, among other things, found that the suit was brought in good faith; that if Carter Coal Company should join the code, it would be compelled to cancel existing contracts and pay its proportionate share of administering the code; that the production of bituminous coal is a local activity carried on within state borders; that coal is the Nation's greatest and primary source of energy, vital to the public welfare, of the utmost importance to the industrial and economic life of the Nation and the health and comfort of its inhabitants; and that its distribution in interstate commerce should be regular, continuous, and free of interruptions, obstructions, burdens, and restraints.\n Other findings are to the effect that such coal is generally sold f.o. b. mine, and the predominant portion of it shipped outside the state in which it is produced; that the distribution and marketing is predominantly interstate in character; and that the intrastate distribution \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 285]\n\u00a0\n and sale are so connected that interstate regulation cannot be accomplished effectively unless transactions of intrastate distribution and sale be regulated.\n The court further found the existence of a condition of unrestrained and destructive competition in the system of distribution and marketing such coal, and of destructive price-cutting, burdening and restraining interstate commerce, and dislocating and diverting its normal flow.\n The court concludes as a matter of law that the bringing of the suit was not premature; that the plaintiff was without legal remedy, and rightly invoked relief in equity; that the labor provisions of the act and code were unconstitutional for reaso  stated, but the price-fixing provisions were valid and constitutional; that the labor provisions are separable; and, since the provisions with respect to price-fixing and unfair competition are valid, the taxing provisions of the act could stand. Therefore, except for granting a permanent injunction against collection of the 'taxes' accrued during the suit (Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 147\n, 148 S., 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A. (N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764), the court denied the relief sought, and dismissed the bill.\n Appeals were taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by the parties; but pending hearing and submission in that court, petitions for writs of certiorari were presented asking us to review the decree of the Supreme Court of the District without awaiting such hearing and submission. Because of the importance of the question and the advantage of a speedy final determination thereof, the writs were granted. \n296 \nU.S. 571\n, 56 S.Ct. 371.\n The remaining two suits (Nos. 649 and 650), involving the same questions, were brought in the federal District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. That court held the act valid and constitutional in its entirety and entered a decree accordingly. R. C. Tway Coal Co. v. Glenn, 12 F.Supp. 570. Appeals were taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 286]\n\u00a0\n Circuit; but, as in the Carter case and for the same reasons, this court granted writs of certiorari in advance of hearing and submission. \n296 \nU.S. 571\n, 56 S.Ct. 371.\n The questions involved will be considered under the following heads:\n\n 1. \nThe right of stockholders to maintain suits of this character.\n\n 2. \nWhether the suits were prematurely brought.\n\n 3. \nWhether the exaction of 15 per centum on the sale price of coal at the mine is a tax or a penalty.\n\n 4. \nThe purposes of the act as set forth in section 1, and the authority vested in Congress by the Constitution to effectuate them.\n\n 5. \nWhether the labor provisions of the act can be upheld as an exercise of the power to regulate interstate commerce.\n\n 6. \nWhether subdivision (g) of part 3 of the code is an unlawful delegation of power.\n\n 7. \nThe constitutionality of the price-fixing provisions, and the question of severability-that is to say, whether, if either the group of labor provisions or the group of price-fixing provisions be found constitutionally invalid, the other can stand as separable.\n First. In the Carter case (Nos. 636 and 651) the stockholder who brought the suit had formally demanded of the board of directors that the company should not join the code, should refuse to pay the tax fixed by the act, and should bring appropriate judicial proceedings to prevent an unconstitutional and improper diversion of the assets of the company and to have determined the liability of the company under the act. The board considered the demand, determined that, while it believed the act to be unconstitutional and economically unsound and that it would adversely affect the business of the company if accepted, nevertheless it should accept the code provided for by the act because the penalty in the form \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 287]\n\u00a0\n of a 15 per cent. tax on its gross sales would be seriously injurous and might result in bankruptcy. This action of the board was approved by a majority of the shareholders at a special meeting called for the purpose of considering it.\n In the Tway Company cases, the company itself brought suit to enjoin the enforcement of the act (No. 649); and a stockholder brought suit to compel the company to accept the code and operate under its provisions (No. 650).\n Without repeating the long averments of the several bills, we are of opinion that the suits were properly brought and were maintainable in a court of equity. The right of stockholders to bring such suits under the circumstances disclosed is settled by the recent decision of this court in Ashwander et al. v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288\n, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L. d. 688 (February 17, 1936), and requires no further discussion.\n Second. That the suits were not prematurely brought also is clear. Section 2 of the act is mandatory in its requirement that the commission be appointed by the President. The provisions of section 4 that the code be formulated and promulgated are equally mandatory. The so-called tax of 15 per cent. is definitely imposed, and its exaction certain to ensue.\n In Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 U.S. 553\n, 592-595, 43 S.Ct. 658, 663, 32 A.L.R. 300, suits were brought by Pennsylvania and Ohio against West Virginia to enjoin the defendant state from enforcing an act of her Legislature upon the ground that it would injuriously affect or cut off the supply of natural gas produced in her territory and carried by pipe lines into the territory of the plaintiff states and there sold and used. These suits were brought a few days after the West Virginia act became effective. No order had yet been made under it by the Public Service Commission, nor had it been tested in actual practice. But it appeared that the act was certain to operate as the complainant \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 288]\n\u00a0\n states apprehended it would. This court held that the suit was not premature. 'One does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief. If the injury is certainly impending, that is enough.'\n Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510, 535\n, 536 S., 45 S.Ct. 571, 574, 39 A.L.R. 468, involved the constitutional validity of the Oregon Compulsory Education Act, which required every parent or other person having control of a child between the ages of eight and sixteen years to send him to the public school of the district where he resides. Suit was brought to enjoin the operation of the act by corporations owning and conducting private schools, on the ground that their business and property was threatened with destruction through the unconstitutional compulsion exercised by the act upon parents and guardians. The suits were held to be not premature, although the effective date of the act had not yet arrived. We said, 'The injury to appellees was present and very real, not a mere possibility in the remote future. If no relief had been possible prior to the effective date of the act, the injury would have become irreparable. Prevention of impending injury by unlawful action is a well-recognized function of courts of equity.'\n See, also, Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 215\n, 216 S., 44 S.Ct. 15; Swift & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 311, 326\n, 48 S.Ct. 311; Euclid v. Ambler Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365, 386\n, 47 S.Ct. 114, 54 A.L.R. 1016; City Bank Co. v. Schnader, \n291 \nU.S. 24, 34\n, 54 S.Ct. 259.\n Third. The so-called excise tax of 15 per centum on the sale price of coal at the mine, or, in the case of captive coal the fair market value, with its drawback allowance of 13 1\/2 per cent., is clearly not a tax but a penalty. The exaction applies to all bituminous coal produced, whether it be sold, transported, or consumed in interstate commerce, or transactions in respect of it be confined wholly \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 289]\n\u00a0\n to the limits of the state. It also applies to 'captive coal'-that is to say, coal produced for the sole use of the producer.\n It is very clear that the 'excise tax' is not imposed for revenue but exacted as a penalty to compel compliance with the regulatory provisions of the act. The whole purpose of the exaction is to coerce what is called an agreement-which, of course, it is not, for it lacks the essential element of consent. One who does a thing in order to avoid a monetary penalty does not agree; he yields to compulsion precisely the same as though he did so to avoid a term in jail.\n The exaction here is a penalty and not a tax within the test laid down by this court in numerous cases. Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 U.S. 20\n, 37-39, 42 S.Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432; United States v. La Franca, \n282 \nU.S. 568, 572\n, 51 S.Ct. 278; United States v. Constantine, \n296 U.S. 287\n, 293 et seq., 56 S.Ct. 223; United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1, 70\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914. While the lawmaker is entirely free to ignore the ordinary meanings of words and make definitions of his own, Karnuth v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 231, 242\n, 49 S.Ct. 274; Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497, 502\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 69 A.L.R. 758, that device may not be employed so as to change the nature of the acts or things to which the words are applied. But it is not necessary to pursue the matter further. That the 'tax' is in fact a penalty is not seriously in dispute. The position of the government, as we understand it, is that the validity of the exaction does not rest upon the taxing power but upon the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce; and that if the act in respect of the labor and price-fixing provisions be not upheld, the 'tax' must fall with them. With that position we agree and confine our consideration accordingly.\n Fourth. Certain recitals contained in the act plainly suggest that its makers were of opinion that its constitutionality could be sustained under some general federal \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 290]\n\u00a0\n power, thought to exist, apart from the specific grants of the Constitution. The fallacy of that view will be apparent when we recall fundamental principles which, although hitherto often expressed in varying forms of words, will bear repetition whenever their accuracy seems to be challenged. The recitals to which we refer are contained in section 1 ( which is simply a preamble to the act), and, among others, are to the effect that the distribution of bituminous coal is of national interest, affecting the health and comfort of the people and the general welfare of the Nation; that this circumstance, together with the necessity of maintaining just and rational relations between the public, owners, producers, and employees, and the right of the public to constant and adequate supplies at reasonable prices, require regulation of the industry as the act provides. These affirmations-and the further ones that the production and distribution of such coal 'directly affect interstate commerce,' because of which and of the waste of the national coal resources and other circumstances, the regulation is necessary for the protection of such commerce-do not constitute an exertion of the will of Congress which is legislation, but a recital of considerations which in the opinion of that body existed and justified the expression of its will in the present act. Nevertheless, this preamble may not be disregarded. On the contrary it is important, because it makes clear, except for the pure assumption that the conditions described 'directly' affect interstate commerce, that the powers which Congress undertook to exercise are not specific but of the most general character-namely, to protect the general public interest and the health and comfort of the people, to conserve privately-owned coal, maintain just relations between producers and employees and others, and promote the general welfare, by controlling nation-wide production and distribution of coal. These, it may be conceded, are objects of great worth; \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 291]\n\u00a0\n but are they ends, the attainment of which has been committed by the Constitution to the federal government? This is a vital question; for nothing is more certain than that beneficent aims, however great or well directed, can never serve in lieu of constitutional power.\n The ruling and firmly established principle is that the powers which the general government may exercise are only those specifically enumerated in the Constitution, and such implied powers as are necessary and proper to carry into effect the enumerated powers. Whether the end sought to be attained by an act of Congress is legitimate is wholly a matter of constitutional power and not at all of legislative discretion. Legislative congressional discretion begins with the choice of means and ends wit the adoption of methods and details to carry the delegated powers into effect. The distinction between these two things-power and discretion-is not only very plain but very important. For while the powers are rigidly limited to the enumerations of the Constitution, the means which may be employed to carry the powers into effect are not restricted, save that they must be appropriate, plainly adapted to the end, and not prohibited by, but consistent with, the letter and spirit of the Constitution. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421. Thus, it may be said that to a constitutional end many ways are open; but to an end not within the terms of the Constitution, all ways are closed.\n The proposition, often advanced and as often discredited, that the power of the federal government inherently extends to purposes affecting the Nation as a whole with which the states severally cannot deal or cannot adequately deal, and the related notion that Congress, entirely apart from those powers delegated by the Constitution, may enact laws to promote the general welfare, have never been accepted but always definitely rejected by this court. Mr. Justice Story, as early as 1816, \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 292]\n\u00a0\n laid down the cardinal rule, which has ever since been followed-that the general government 'can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the constitution, and the powers actually granted, must be such as are expressly given, or given by necessary implication.' Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326. In the Framers Convention, the proposal to confer a general power akin to that just discussed was included in Mr. Randolph's resolutions, the sixth of which, among other things, declared that the National Legislature ought to enjoy the legislative rights vested in Congress by the Confederation, and 'moreover to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent, or in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted by the exercise of individual Legislation.' The convention, however, declined to confer upon Congress power in such general terms; instead of which it carefully limited the powers which it thought wise to intrust to Congress by specifying them, thereby denying all others not granted expressly or by necessary implication. It made no grant of authority to Congress to legislate substantively for the general welfare, United States v. Butler, supra, \n297 U.S. 1\n, at page 64, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914; and no such authority exists, save as the general welfare may be promoted by the exercise of the powers which are granted. Compare Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11, 22\n, 25 S.Ct. 358, 3 Ann.Cas. 765.\n There are many subjects in respect of which the several states have not legislated in harmony with one another, and in which their varying laws and the failure of some of them to act at all have resulted in injurious confusion and embarrassment. See Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211, 232\n, 233 S., 20 S.Ct. 96. The state laws with respect to marriage and divorce present a case in point; and the great necessity of national legislation on that subject has been from time to time vigorously urged. Other pertinent examples are laws with respect to nego- \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 293]\n\u00a0\n tiable instruments, desertion and nonsupport, certain phases of state taxation, and others which we do not pause to mention. In many of these fields of legislation, the necessity of bringing the applicable rules of law into general harmonious relation has been so great that a Commission on Uniform State Laws, composed of commissioners from every state in the Union, has for many years been industriously and successfully working to that end by preparing and securing the passage by the several states of uniform laws. If there be an easier and constitutional way to these desirable results through congressional action, it thus far has escaped discovery.\n Replying directly to the suggestion advanced by counsel in Kansas v. C lorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 89\n, 90 S., 27 S.Ct. 655, 664, to the effect that necessary powers national in their scope must be found vested in Congress, though not expressly granted or essentially implied, this court said:\n'But the proposition that there are legislative powers affecting the nation as a whole which belong to, although not expressed in the grant of powers, is in direct conflict with the doctrine that this is a government of enumerated powers. That this is such a government clearly appears from the Constitution, independently of the Amendments, for otherwise there would be an instrument granting certain specified things made operative to grant other and distinct things. This natural construction of the original body of the Constitution is made absolutely certain by the 10th Amendment. This Amendment, which was seemingly adopted with prescience of just such contention as the present, disclosed the widespread fear that the national government might, under the pressure of a supposed general welfare, attempt to exercise powers which had not been granted. With equal determination the framers intended that no such assumption should ever find justification in the organic act, and that if, in the future, further powers seemed necessary, they should \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 294]\n\u00a0\n be granted by the people in the manner they had provided for amending that act.'\n\n The general rule with regard to the respective powers of the national and the state governments under the Constitution is not in doubt. The states were before the Constitution; and, consequently, their legislative powers antedated the Constitution. Those who framed and those who adopted that instrument meant to carve from the general mass of legislative powers, then possessed by the states, only such portions as it was thought wise to confer upon the federal government; and in order that there should be no uncertainty in respect of what was taken and what was left, the national powers of legislation were not aggregated but enumerated-with the result that what was not embraced by the enumeration remained vested in the states without change or impairment. Thus, 'when it was found necessary to establish a national government for national purposes,' this court said in Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, 124, 'a part of the powers of the States and of the people of the States was granted to the United States and the people of the United States. This grant operated as a further limitation upon the powers of the States, so that now the governments of the States possess all the powers of the Parliament of England, except such as have been delegated to the United States or reserved by the people.' While the states are not sovereign in the true sense of that term, but only quasi sovereign, yet in respect of all powers reserved to them they are supreme-'as independent of the general government as that government within its sphere is independent of the States.' The Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124. And since every addition to the national legislative power to some extent detracts from or invades the power of the states, it is of vital moment that, in order to preserve the fixed balance intended by the Constitution, the powers of the general government \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 295]\n\u00a0\n be not so extended as to embrace any not within the express terms of the several grants or the implications necessarily to be drawn therefrom. It is no longer open to question that the general government, unlike the states, Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251, 275\n, 38 S.Ct. 529, 3 A.L.R. 649, Ann.Cas.1918E 724, possesses no inherent power in respect of the internal affairs of the states; and emphatically not with regard to legislation. The question in respect of the inherent power of that government as to the external affairs of the Nation and in the field of international law is a wholly different matter which it is not necessary now to consider. See, however, Jones v. United States, \n137 \nU.S. 202, 212\n, 11 S.Ct. 80; Nishimur Ekiu v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 651, 659\n, 12 S.Ct. 336; Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 U.S. 698\n, 705 et seq., 13 S.Ct. 1016; Burnet v. Brooks, \n288 \nU.S. 378, 396\n, 53 S.Ct. 457, 86 A.L.R. 747.\n The determination of the Framers Convention and the ratifying conventions to preserve complete and unimpaired state self-government in all matters not committed to the general government is one of the plainest facts which emerges from the history of their deliberations. And adherence to that determination is incumbent equally upon the federal government and the states. State powers can neither be appropriated on the one hand nor abdicated on the other. As this court said in Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725, 'The preservation of the States, and the maintenance of their governments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National government. The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.' Every journey to a forbidden end begins with the first step; and the danger of such a step by the federal government in the direction of taking over the powers of the states is that the end of the journey may find the states so despoiled of their powers, or-what may amount to the same thing-so \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 296]\n\u00a0\n relieved of the responsibilities which possession of the powers necessarily enjoins, as to reduce them to little more than geographical subdivisions of the national domain. It is safe to say that if, when the Constitution was under consideration, it had been thought that any such danger lurked behind its plain words, it would never have been ratified.\n And the Constitution itself is in every real sense a law-the lawmakers being the people themselves, in whom under our system all political power and sovereignty primarily resides, and through whom such power and sovereignty primarily speaks. It is by that law, and not otherwise, that the legislative, executive, and judicial agencies which it created exercise such political authority as they have been permitted to possess. The Constitution speaks for itself in terms so plain that to misunderstand their import is not rationally possible. 'We the People of the United States,' it says, 'do ordain and establish this Constitution.' Ordain and establish! These are definite words of enactment, and without more would stamp what follows with the dignity and character of law. The framers of the Constitution, however, were not content to let the matter rest here, but provided explicitly-'This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.' (Const. art. 6, cl. 2.) The supremacy of the Constitution as law is thus declared without qualification. That supremacy is absolute; the supremacy of a statute enacted by Congress is not absolute but conditioned upon its being made in pursuance of the Constitution. And a judicial tribunal, clothed by that instrument with complete judicial power, and, therefore, by the very nature of the power, required to ascertain and apply the law to the facts in every case or proceeding properly brought for adjudication, must apply the supreme law and reject the inferior stat- \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 297]\n\u00a0\n ute whenever the two conflict. In the discharge of that duty, the opinion of the lawmakers that a statute passed by them is valid must be given great weight, Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 544\n, 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238; but their opinion, or the court's opinion, that the statute will prove greatly or generally beneficial is wholly irrelevant to the inquiry. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495, 549\n, 550 S., 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947.\n We have set forth, perhaps at unnecessary length, the foregoing principles, because it seemed necessary to do so in order to demonstrate that the general purposes which the act recites, and whic , therefore, unless the recitals be disregarded, Congress undertook to achieve, are beyond the power of Congress except so far, and only so far, as they may be realized by an exercise of some specific power granted by the Constitution. Proceeding by a process of elimination, which it is not necessary to follow in detail, we shall find no grant of power which authorizes Congress to legislate in respect of these general purposes unless it be found in the commerce clause-and this we now consider.\n Fifth. Since the validity of the act depends upon whether it is a regulation of interstate commerce, the nature and extent of the power conferred upon Congress by the commerce clause becomes the determinative question in this branch of the case. The commerce clause (art. 1,  8, cl. 3) vests in Congress the power 'To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.' The function to be exercised is that of regulation. The thing to be regulated is the commerce described. In exercising the authority conferred by this clause of the Constitution, Congress is powerless to regulate anything which is not commerce, as it is powerless to do anything about commerce which is not regulation. We first inquire, then-What is commerce? The term, as this court many times has said, is \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 298]\n\u00a0\n one of extensive import. No allembracing definition has ever been formulated. The question is to be approached both affirmatively and negatively-that is to say, from the points of view as to what it includes and what it excludes.\n In Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189, 190, Chief Justice Marshall said:\n'Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic, but it is something more-it is intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between nations, and parts of nations, in all its branches, and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse.'\n\n As used in the Constitution, the word 'commerce' is the equivalent of the phrase 'intercourse for the purposes of trade,' and includes transportation, purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities between the citizens of the different states. And the power to regulate commerce embraces the instruments by which commerce is carried on. Welton v. State of Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, 280; Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211, 241\n, 20 S.Ct. 96; Hopkins v. United States, \n171 \nU.S. 578, 597\n, 19 S.Ct. 40. In Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161, 177\n, 28 S.Ct. 277, 281, 13 Ann. Cas. 764, the phrase 'Commerce among the several states' was defined as comprehending 'traffic, intercourse, trade, navigation, communication, the transit of persons, and the transmission of messages by telegraph,-indeed, every species on commercial intercourse among the several states.' In Veazie et al. v. Moor, 14 How. 568, 573, 574, this court, after saying that the phrase could never be applied to transactions wholly internal, significantly added: 'Nor can it be properly concluded, that, because the products of domestic enterprise in agriculture or manufactures, or in the arts, may ultimately become the subjects of foreign commerce, that the control of the means or the encouragements by which enterprise is fostered and protected, is legitimately within the import of the phrase foreign commerce, or fairly im- \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 299]\n\u00a0\n plied in any investiture of the power to regulate such commerce. A pretension as far reaching as this, would extend to contracts between citizen and citizen of the same State, would control the pursuits of the planter, the grazier, the manufacturer, the mechanic, the immense operations of the collieries and mines and furnaces of the country; for there is not one of these avocations, the results of which may not become the subjects of foreign commerce, and be borne either by turnpikes, canals, or railroads, from point to point within the several States, towards an ultimate destination, like the one above mentioned.'\n The distinct on between manufacture and commerce was discussed in Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 21 S., 22, 9 S.Ct. 6, 10, and it was said:\n'No distinction is more popular to the common mind, or more clearly expressed in economic and political literature, than that between manufactures and commerce. Manufacture is transformation-the fashioning of raw materials into a change of form for use. The functions of commerce are different. ... If it be held that the term includes the regulation of all such manufactures as are intended to be the subject of commercial transactions in the future, it is impossible to deny that it would also include all productive industries that contemplate the same thing. The result would be that congress would be invested, to the exclusion of the states, with the power to regulate, not only manufacture, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock-raising, domestic fisheries, mining,-in short, every branch of human industry. For is there one of them that does not contemplate, more or less clearly, an interstate or foreign market? Does not the wheat-grower of the northwest, and the cotton-planter of the south, plant, cultivate, and harvest his crop with an eye on the prices at Liverpool, New York, and Chicago? The power being vested in congress and \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 300]\n\u00a0\n denied to the states, it would follow as an inevitable result that the duty would devolve on congress to regulate all of these delicate, multiform, and vital interests,-interests which in their nature are, and must be, local in all the details of their successful management.'\n\n And then, as though foreseeing the present controversy, the opinion proceeds:\n'Any movement towards the establishment of rules of production in this vast country, with its many different climates and opportunities, could only be at the sacrifice of the peculiar advantages of a large part of the localities in it, if not of every one of them. On the other hand, any movement towards the local, detailed, and incongruous legislation required by such an interpretation would be about the widest possible departure from the declared object of the clause in question. Nor this alone. Even in the exercise of the power contended for, congress would be confined to the regulation, not of certain branches of industry, however numerous, but to those instances in each and every branch where the producer contemplated an interstate market. ... A situation more paralyzing to the state governments, and more provocative of conflicts between the general government and the states, and less likely to have been what the framers of the constitution intended, it would be difficult to imagine.'\n\n Chief Justice Fuller, speaking for this court in United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 13 S., 15 S.Ct. 249, 253, said:\n'Doubtless the power to control the manufacture of a given thing involves, in a certain sense, the control of its disposition, but this is a secondary, and not the primary, sense; and, although the exercise of that power may result in bringing the operation of commerce into play, it does not control it, and affects it only incidentally and indirectly. Commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it. ... \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 301]\n\u00a0\n 'It is vital that the independence of the commercial power and of the police power, and the delimitation between them, however sometimes perplexing, should always be recognized and observed, for, while the one furnishes the strongest bond of union, the other is essential to the preservation of the autonomy of the states as required by our dual form of government; and acknowledged evils, however grave and urgent they may appear to be, had better be borne, than the risk be run, in the effort to suppress them, of more serious consequences by resort to expedients of even doubtful constitutionality. ...\n\n'The regulation of commerce applies to the subjects of commerce, and not to matters of internal police. Contracts to buy, sell, or exchange goods to be transported among the several  ates, the transportation and its instrumentalities, and articles bought, sold, or exchanged for the purposes of such transit among the states, or put in the way of transit, may be regulated; but this is because they form part of interstate trade or commerce. The fact that an article is manufactured for export to another state does not of itself make it an article of interstate commerce, and the intent of the manufacturer does not determine the time when the article or product passes from the control of the state and belongs to commerce.'\n\n That commodities produced or manufactured within a state are intended to be sold or transported outside the state does not render their production or manufacture subject to federal regulation under the commerce clause. As this court said in Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517, 526\n, 6 S.Ct. 475, 478, 'Though intended for exportation, they may never be exported,-the owner has a perfect right to change his mind,-and until actually put in motion, for some place out of the state, or committed to the custody of a carrier for transportation to such place, why may they not be regarded as still remaining a part of the general mass of \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 302]\n\u00a0\n property in the state?' It is true that this was said in respect of a challenged power of the state to impose a tax; but the query is equally pertinent where the question, as here, is with regard to the power of regulation. The case was relied upon in Kidd v. Pearson, supra, \n128 U.S. 1\n, at page 26, 9 S.Ct. 6, 12. 'The application of the principles above announced,' it was there said, 'to the case under consideration leads to a conclusion against the contention of the plaintiff in error. The police power of a state is as broad and plenary as its taxing power, and property within the state is subject to the operations of the former so long as it is within the regulating restrictions of the latter.'\n In Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245, 259\n, 260 S., 43 S.Ct. 83, 86, we held that the possibility, or even certainty of exportation of a product or article from a state did not determine it to be in interstate commerce before the commencement of its movement from the state. To hold otherwise 'would nationalize all industries, it would nationalize and withdraw from state jurisdiction and deliver to federal commercial control the fruits of California and the South, the wheat of the West and its meats, the cotton of the South, the shoes of Massachusetts and the woolen industries of other states at the very inception of their production or growth, that is, the fruits unpicked, the cotton and wheat ungathered, hides and flesh of cattle yet 'on the hoof,' wool yet unshorn, and coal yet unmined because they are in varying percentages destined for and surely to be exported to states other than those of their production.'\n In Oliver Iron Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172, 178\n, 43 S.Ct. 526, 529, we said on the authority of numerous cited cases: 'Mining is not interstate commerce, but like manufacturing, is a local business, subject to local regulation and taxation. ... Its character in this regard is intrinsic, is not affected by the intended use or disposal of the product, is not controlled by contractual engagements, and persists even \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 303]\n\u00a0\n though the business be conducted in close connection with interstate commerce.'\n The same rule applies to the production of oil. 'Such production is essentially a mining operation, and therefore is not a part of interstate commerce, even though the product obtained is intended to be and in fact is immediately shipped in such commerce.' Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 210, 235\n, 52 S.Ct. 559, 565, 86 A.L.R. 403. One who produces or manufactures a commodity, subsequently sold and shipped by him in interstate commerce, whether such sale and shipment were originally intended or not, has engaged in two distinct and separate activities. So far as he produces or manufactures a commodity, his business is purely local. So far as he sells and ships, or contracts to sell and ship, the commodity to customers in another state, he engages in interstate commerce. In respect of the former, he is subject only to regulation by the state; in respect of the latter, to regulation only by the federal government. Utah Power & L. Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 182\n, 52 S.Ct. 548. Production is not commerce; but a step in preparation for commerce. Chassaniol v. Greenwood, \n291 \nU.S. 584, 587\n, 54 S.Ct. 541.\n We have seen that the word 'commerce' is the equivalent of the phrase 'intercourse for the purposes of trade.' Plainly, the incidents leading up to and culminating in the mining of coal do not constitute such intercourse. The employment of men, the fixing of their wages, hours of labor, and working conditions, the bargaining in respect of these things- whether carried on separately or collectively-each and all constitute intercourse for the purposes of production, not of trade. The latter is a thing apart from the relation of employer and employee, which in all producing occupations is purely local in character. Extraction of coal from the mine is the aim and the completed result of local activities. Commerce in the coal mined is not brought into being by \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 304]\n\u00a0\n force of these activities, but by negotiations, agreements and circumstances entirely apart from production. Mining brings the subject- matter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of it.\n A consideration of the foregoing, and of many cases which might be added to those already cited, renders inescapable the conclusion that the effect of the labor provisions of the act, including those in respect of minimum wages, wage agreements, collective bargaining, and the Labor Board and its powers, primarily falls upon production and not upon commerce; and confirms the further resulting conclusion that production is a purely local activity. It follows that none of these essential antecedents of production constitutes a transaction in or forms any part of interstate commerce. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, supra, \n295 U.S. 495\n, at page 542 et seq., 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947. Everything which moves in interstate commerce has had a local origin. Without local production somewhere, interstate commerce, as now carried on, would practically disappear. Nevertheless, the local character of mining, of manufacturing, and of crop growing is a fact, and remains a fact, whatever may be done with the products.\n Certain decisions of this court, superficially considered, seem to lend support to the defense of the act now under review. But upon examination, they will be seen to be inapposite. Thus, Coronado Co. v. United Mine Workers, \n268 \nU.S. 295, 310\n, 45 S.Ct. 551, and kindred cases, involved conspiracies to restrain interstate commerce in violation of the Anti-Trust Laws. The acts of the persons involved were local in character; but the intent was to restrain interstate commerce, and the means employed were calculated to carry that intent into effect. Interstate commerce was the direct object of attack; and the restraint of such commerce was the necessary consequence of the acts and the immediate end in view. Bedford Cut Stone Co. \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 305]\n\u00a0\n v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Ass'n, \n274 \nU.S. 37, 46\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 54 A.L.R. 791. The applicable law was concerned not with the character of the acts or of the means employed, which might be in and of themselves purely local, but with the intent and direct operation of those acts and means upon interstate commerce. 'The mere reduction in the supply of an article,' this court said in the Coronado Co. Case, supra, \n268 U.S. 295\n, at page 310, 45 S.Ct. 551, 556, 'to be shipped in interstate commerce by the illegal or tortious prevention of its manufacture or production is ordinarily an indirect and remote obstruction to that commerce. But when the intent of those unlawfully preventing the manufacture or production is shown to be to restrain or control the supply entering and moving in interstate commerce, or the price of it in interstate markets, their action is a direct violation of the Anti-Trust Act (15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.).'\n Another group of cases, of which Swift & Company v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S.Ct. 276, is an example, rest upon the circumstance that the acts in question constituted direct interferences with the 'flow' of commerce among the states. In the Swift Case, live stock was consigned and delivered to stockyards-not as a place of final destination, but, as the court said in Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 516\n, 42 S.Ct. 397, 402, 23 A.L.R. 229, 'a throat through which the current flows.' The sales which ensued merely changed the private interest in the subject of the current without interfering with its continuity. Industrial Ass'n of San Francisco v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64, 79\n, 45 S.Ct. 403. It was nowhere suggested in these cases that the interstate commerce power extended to the growth or production of the things which, after production, entered the flow. If the court had held that the raising of the cattle, which were involved in the Swift Case, including the wages paid to and working conditions of the herders and others employed in the business, could be regulated by Congress, that decision and decisions holding similarly would be in \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 306]\n\u00a0\n point; for it is that situation, and not the one with which the court actually dealt, which here concerns us.\n The distinction suggested is illustrated by the decision in Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis S.W.R. Co., \n249 U.S. 134\n, 150-152, 39 S.Ct. 237. That case dealt with orders of a state commission fixing railroad rates. One of the questions considered was whether certain shipments of rough material from the forest to mills in the same state for manufacture, followed by the forwarding of the finished product to points outside the state, was a continuous movement in interstate commerce. It appeared that when the rough material reached the mills it was manufactured into various articles which were stacked or placed in kilns to dry, the processes occupying several months. Markets for the manufactured articles were almost entirely in other states or in foreign countries. About 95 per cent. of the finished articles was made for outbound shipment. When the rough material was shipped to the mills, it was expected by the mills that this percentage of the finished articles would be so sold and shipped outside the state. And all of them knew and intended that this 95 per cent. of the finished product would be so sold and shipped. This court held that the state order did not interfere with interstate commerce, and that the Swift Case was not in point; as it is not in point here.\n The restricted field covered by the Swift and kindred cases is illustrated by the Schechter Case, supra, \n295 U.S. 495\n, at page 543, 55 S. Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947. There the commodity in question, although shipped from another state, had come to rest in the state of its destination, and, as the court pointed out, was no longer in a current or flow of interstate commerce. The Swift doctrine was rejected as inapposite. In the Schechter Case the flow had ceased. Here it had not begun. The difference is not one of substance. The applicable principle is the same. \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 307]\n\u00a0\n But section 1 (the Preamble) of the act now under review declares that all production and distribution of bituminous coal 'bear upon and directly affect its interstate commerce'; and that regulation thereof is imperative for the protection of such commerce. The contention of the government is that the labor provisions of the act may be sustained in that view.\n That the production of every commodity intended for interstate sale and transportation has some effect upon interstate commerce may be, if it has not already been, freely granted; and we are brought to the final and decisive inquiry, whether here that effect is direct, as the 'Preamble' recites, or indirect. The distinction is not formal, but substantial in the highest degree, as we pointed out in the Schechter Case, supra, \n295 U.S. 495\n, at page 546 et seq., 55 S.Ct. 837, 850, 97 A.L.R. 947. 'If the commerce clause were construed,' we there said, 'to reach all enterprises and transactions which could be said to have an indirect effect upon interstate commerce, the federal authority would embrace practically all the activities of the people, and the authority of the state over its domestic concerns would exist only by sufferance of the federal government. Indeed, on such a theory, even the development of the state's commercial facilities would be subject to federal control.' It was also pointed out, \n295 U.S. 495\n, at page 548, 55 S.Ct. 837, 851, 97 A.L.R. 947, that 'the distinction between direct and indirect effects of intrastate transactions upon interstate commerce must be recognized as a fundamental one, essential to the maintenance of our constitutional system.'\n Whether the effect of a given activity or condition is direct or indirect is not always easy to determine. The word 'direct' implies that the activity or condition invoked or blamed shall operate proximately-not mediately, remotely, or collaterally-to produce the effect. It connotes the absence of an efficient intervening agency \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 308]\n\u00a0\n or condition. And the extent of the effect bears no logical relation to its character. The distinction between a direct and an indirect effect turns, not upon the magnitude of either the cause or the effect, but entirely upon the manner in which the effect has been brought about. If the production by one man of a single ton of coal intended for interstate sale and shipment, and actually so sold and shipped, affects interstate commerce indirectly, the effect does not become direct by multiplying the tonnage, or increasing the number of men employed, or adding to the expense or complexities of the business, or by all combined. It is quite true that rules of law are sometimes qualified by considerations of degree, as the government argues. But the matter of degree has no bearing upon the question here, since that question is not-What is the extent of the local activity or condition, or the extent of the effect produced upon interstate commerce? but-What is the relation between the activity or condition and the effect?\n Much stress is put upon the evils which come from the struggle between employers and employees over the matter of wages, working conditions, the right of collective bargaining, etc., and the resulting strikes, curtailment, and irregularity of production and effect on prices; and it is insisted that interstate commerce is greatly affected thereby. But, in addition to what has just been said, the conclusive answer is that the evils are all local evils over which the federal government has no legislative control. The relation of employer and employee is a local relation. At common law, it is one of the domestic relations. The wages are paid for the doing of local work. Working conditions are obviously local conditions. The employees are not engaged in or about commerce, but exclusively in producing a commodity. And the controversies and evils, which it is the object of the \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 309]\n\u00a0\n act to regulate and minimize, are local controversies and evils affecting local work undertaken to accomplish that local result. Such effect as they may have upon commerce, however extensive it may be, is secondary and indirect. An increase in the greatness of the effect adds to its importance. It does not alter its character.\n The government's contentions in defense of the labor provisions are really disposed of adversely by our decision in the Schechter Case, supra. The only perceptible difference between that case and this is that in the Schechter Case the federal power was asserted with respect to commodities which had come to rest after their interstate transportation; w ile here, the case deals with commodities at rest before interstate commerce has begun. That difference is without significance. The federal regulatory power ceases when interstate commercial intercourse ends; and, correlatively, the power does not attach until interstate commercial intercourse begins. There is no basis in law or reason for applying different rules to the two situations. No such distinction can be found in anything said in the Schechter Case. On the contrary, the situations were recognized as akin. The opinion, \n295 U.S. 495\n, at page 546, 55 S.Ct. 837, 850, 97 A.L.R. 947, after calling attention to the fact that if the commerce clause could be construed to reach transactions having an indirect effect upon interstate commerce, the federal authority would embrace practically all the activities of the people, and the authority of the state over its domestic concerns would exist only by sufferance of the federal government, we said: 'Indeed, on such a theory, even the development of the state's commercial facilities would be subject to federal control.' And again, after pointing out that hours and wages have no direct relation to interstate commerce and that if the federal government had power to determine the wages and hours of employees in the internal commerce of a state because of their relation to cost and prices and their \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 310]\n\u00a0\n indirect effect upon interstate commerce, we said, \n295 U.S. 495\n, at page 549, 55 S.Ct. 837, 851, 97 A.L.R. 947: 'All the processes of production and distribution that enter into cost could likewise be controlled. If the cost of doing an intrastate business is in itself the permitted object of federal control, the extent of the regulation of cost would be a question of discretion and not of power.' A reading of the entire opinion makes clear, what we now declare, that the want of power on the part of the federal government is the same whether the wages, hours of service, and working conditions, and the bargaining about them, are related to production before interstate commerce has begun, or to sale and distribution after it has ended.\n Sixth. That the act, whatever it may be in form, in fact is compulsory clearly appears. We have already discussed section 3, which imposes the excise tax as a penalty to compel 'acceptance' of the code. Section 14 (15 U.S.C.A.  818) provides that the United States shall purchase no bituminous coal produced at any mine where the producer has not complied with the provisions of the code; and that each contract made by the United States shall contain a provision that the contractor will buy no bituminous coal to use on, or in the carrying out of, such contract unless the producer be a member of the code, as certified by the coal commission. In the light of these provisions we come to a consideration of subdivision (g) of part 3 of section 4, dealing with 'labor relations.'\n That subdivision delegates the power to fix maximum hours of labor to a part of the producers and the miners-namely, 'the producers of more than two-thirds the annual national tonnage production for the preceding calendar year' and 'more than one-half the mine workers employed'; and to producers of more than two-thirds of the district annual tonnage during the preceding calendar year and a majority of the miners, there is delegated the power to fix minimum wages for the district \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 311]\n\u00a0\n or group of districts. The effect, in respect of wages and hours, is to subject the dissentient minority, either of producers or miners or both, to the will of the stated majority, since, by refusing to submit, the minority at once incurs the hazard of enforcement of the drastic compulsory provisions of the act to which we have referred. To 'accept,' in these circumstances, is not to exercise a choice, but to surrender to force.\n The power conferred upon the majority is, in effect, the power to regulate the affairs of an unwilling minority. This is legislative delegation in its most obnoxious form; for it  not even delegation to an official or an official body, presumptively disinterested, but to private persons whose interests may be and often are adverse to the interests of others in the same business. The record shows that the conditions of competition differ among the various localities. In some, coal dealers compete among themselves. In other localities, they also compete with the mechanical production of electrical energy and of natural gas. Some coal producers favor the code; others oppose it; and the record clearly indicates that this diversity of view arises from their conflicting and even antagonistic interests. The difference between producing coal and regulating its production is, of course, fundamental. The former is a private activity; the latter is necessarily a governmental function, since, in the very nature of things, one person may not be intrusted with the power to regulate the business of another, and especially of a competitor. And a statute which attempts to confer such power undertakes an intolerable and unconstitutional interference with personal liberty and private property. The delegation is so clearly arbitrary, and so clearly a denial of rights safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, that it is unnecessary to do more than refer to decisions of this court which foreclose the question. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 312]\n\u00a0\n \n295 U.S. 495\n, at page 537, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947; Eubank v. Richmond, \n226 \nU.S. 137, 143\n, 33 S.Ct. 76, 42 L.R.A.( N.S.) 1123; Washington ex rel. Seattle Trust Co. v. Roberge, \n278 \nU.S. 116, 121\n, 122 S., 49 S.Ct. 50, 86 A.L.R. 654.\n Seventh. Finally, we are brought to the price-fixing provisions of the code. The necessity of considering the question of their constitutionality will depend upon whether they are separable from the labor provisions so that they can stand independently. Section 15 of the act (15 U.S.C.A.  819) provides:\n'If any provision of this Act (chapter), or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of the Act ( chapter) and the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.'\n\n In the absence of such a provision, the presumption is that the Legislature intends an act to be effective as an entirety-that is to say, the rule is against the mutilation of a statute; and if any provision be unconstitutional, the presumption is that the remaining provisions fall with it. The effect of the statute is to reverse this presumption in favor of inseparability, and create the opposite one of separability. Under the nonstatutory rule, the burden is upon the supporter of the legislation to show the separability of the provisions involved. Under the statutory rule, the burden is shifted to the assailant to show their inseparability. But under either rule, the determination, in the end, is reached by applying the same test-namely, What was the intent of the lawmakers?\n Under the statutory rule, the presumption must be overcome by considerations which establish 'the clear probability that the invalid part being eliminated the Legislature would not have been satisfied with what remains,' Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 U.S. 235\n, 241 et seq., 49 S.Ct. 115, 117, 60 A.L.R. 596; or, as stated in Utah Power & L. Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 184\n, 185 S., 52 S.Ct. 548, 553, 'the clear probability that the Legislature would not have been satisfied with the statute un- \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 313]\n\u00a0\n less it had included the invalid part.' Whether the provisions of a statute are so interwoven that one being held invalid the others must fall, presents a question of statutory construction and of legislative intent, to the determination of which the statutory provision becomes an aid. 'But it is an aid merely; not an inexorable command.' Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 44 S.Ct. 323, 325. The presumption in favor of separability does not authorize the court to give the statute 'an effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole.' Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 330, 362\n, 55 S.Ct. 758, 768.\n The statutory aid to construction in no way alters the rule that in order to hold one part of a statute unconstitutional and uphold another part as separable, they must not be mutually dependent upon one another. Perhaps a fair approach to a solution of the problem is to suppose that while the bill was pending in Congress a motion to strike out the labor provisions had prevailed, and to inquire whether, in that event, the statute should be so construed as to justify the conclusion that Congress, notwithstanding, probably would not have passed the price-fixing provisions of the code.\n Section 3 of the act, which provides that no producer shall, by accepting the code or the drawback of taxes, be estopped from contesting the constitutionality of any provision of the code is thought to aid the separability clause. But the effect of that provision is simply to permit the producer to challenge any provision of the code despite his acceptance of the code or the drawback. It seems not to have anything to do with the question of separability.\n With the foregoing principles in mind, let us examine the act itself. The title of the act and the preamble demonstrate, as we have already seen, that Congress desired to accomplish certain general purposes therein recited. To that end it created a commission, with man- \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 314]\n\u00a0\n datory directions to formulate into a working agreement the provisions set forth in section 4 of the act. That being done, the result is a code. Producers accepting and operating under the code are to be known as code members; and section 4 specifically requires that, in order to carry out the policy of the act, 'the code shall contain the conditions, provisions, and obligations,' (15 U.S.C.A.  805), which are then set forth. No power is vested in the commission, in formulating the code, to omit any of these conditions, provisions, or obligations. The mandate to include them embraces all of them. Following the requirement just quoted, and, significantly, in the same section (International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91, 112\n, 113 S., 30 S.Ct. 481, 27 L.R.A.(N.S.) 493, 18 Ann.Cas. 1103) under appropriate headings, the price-fixing and labor- regulating provisions are set out in great detail. These provisions, plainly meant to operate together and not separately, constitute the means designed to bring about the stabilization of bituminous-coal production, and thereby to regulate or affect interstate commerce in such coal. The first clause of the title is: 'To stabilize the bituminous coal-mining industry and promote its interstate commerce.'\n Thus, the primary contemplation of the act is stabilization of the industry through the regulation of labor and the regulation of prices; for, since both were adopted, we must conclude that both were thought essential. The regulations of labor on the one hand and prices on the other furnish mutual aid and support; and their associated force-not one or the other but both combined-was deemed by Congress to be necessary to achieve the end sought. The statutory mandate for a code upheld by two legs at once suggests the improbability that Congress would have assented to a code supported by only one.\n This seems plain enough; for Congress must have been conscious of the fact that elimination of the labor provi- \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 315]\n\u00a0\n sions from the act would seriously impair, if not destroy, the force and usefulness of the price provisions. The interdependence of wages and prices is manifest. Approximately two-thirds of the cost of producing a ton of coal is represented by wages. Fair prices necessarily depend upon the cost of production; and since wages constitute so large a proportion of the cost, prices cannot be fixed with any proper relation to cost without taking into consideration this major element. If one of them becomes unc rtain, uncertainty with respect to the other necessarily ensues.\n So much is recognized by the code itself. The introductory clause of part 3 (15 U.S.C.A.  808) declares that the conditions respecting labor relations are 'to effectuate the purposes of this Act (chapter).' And subdivision (a) of part 2 (15 U.S.C.A.  807(a), quoted in the forepart of this opinion, reads in part: 'In order to sustain the stabilization of wages, working conditions, and maximum hours of labor, said prices shall be established so as to yield a return per net ton for each district in a minimum price area, ... equal as nearly as may be to the weighted average of the total costs, per net ton.' Thus wages, hours of labor, and working conditions are to be so adjusted as to effectuate the purposes of the act; and prices are to be so regulated as to stabilize wages, working conditions, and hours of labor which have been or are to be fixed under the labor provisions. The two are so woven together as to render the probability plain enough that uniform prices, in the opinion of Congress, could not be fairly fixed or effectively regulated, without also regulating these elements of labor which enter so largely into the cost of production.\n These two sets of requirements are not like a collection of bricks, some of which may be taken away without disturbing the others, but rather are like the interwoven threads constituting the warp and woof of a fabric, one \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 316]\n\u00a0\n set of which cannot be removed without fatal consequences to the whole. Paraphrasing the words of this court in Butts v. Merchants' Transp. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 126, 133\n, 33 S.Ct. 964, we inquire-What authority has this court, by construction, to convert the manifest purpose of Congress to regulate production by the mutual operation and interaction of fixed wages and fixed prices into a purpose to regulate the subject by the operation of the latter alone? Are we at liberty to say from the fact that Congress has adopted an entire integrated system that it probably would have enacted a doubtfully-effective fraction of the system? The words of the concurring opinion in the Schechter Case, \n295 U.S. 495\n, at pages 554, 555, 55 S.Ct. 837, 853, 97 A.L.R. 947, are pertinent in reply: 'To take from this code the provisions as to wages and the hours of labor is to destroy it altogether. ... Wages and hours of labor are essential features of the plan, its very bone and sinew. There is no opportunity in such circumstances for the severance of the infected parts in the hope of saving the remainder.' The conclusion is unavoidable that the price-fixing provisions of the code are so related to and dependent upon the labor provisions as conditions, considerations, or compensations, as to make it clearly probable that the latter being held bad, the former would not have been passed. The fall of the latter, therefore, carries down with it the former. International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, supra, \n217 U.S. 91\n, at page 113, 30 S.Ct. 481, 27 L.R.A.(N.S.) 493, 18 Ann.Cas. 1103; Warren v. Mayor and Aldermen of Charlestown, 2 Gray (Mass.) 84, 98, 99.\n The price-fixing provisions of the code are thus disposed of without coming to the question of their constitutionality; but neither this disposition of the matter, nor anything we have said, is to be taken as indicating that the court is of opinion that these provisions, if separately enacted, could be sustained.\n If there be in the act provisions, other than those we have considered, that may stand independently, the \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 317]\n\u00a0\n question of their validity is left for future determination when, if ever, that question shall be presented for consideration.\n The decrees in Nos. 636, 649, and 650 must be reversed and the causes remanded for further consideration in conformity with this opinion. The decree in No. 651 will be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Separate opinion of Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES.\n I agree that the stockholders were entitled to bring their suits; that, in view of the question whether any part of the act could be sustained, the suits were not premature; that the so-called tax is not a real tax, but a penalty; that the constitutional power of the federal government to impose this penalty must rest upon the commerce clause, as the government concedes; that production-in this case mining-which precedes commerce is not itself commerce; and that the power to regulate commerce among the several states is not a power to regulate industry within the state.\n The power to regulate interstate commerce embraces the power to protect that commerce from injury, whatever may be the source of the dangers which threaten it, and to adopt any appropriate means to that end. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 51\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44. Congress thus has adequate authority to maintain the orderly conduct of interstate commerce and to provide for the peaceful settlement of disputes which threaten it. Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 570\n, 50 S.Ct. 427. But Congress may not use this protective authority as a pretext for the exertion of power to regulate activities and relations within the states which affect interstate commerce only indirectly. Otherwise, in view of the multitude of indirect effect, Congress in its discretion \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 318]\n\u00a0\n could assume control of virtually all the activities of the people to the subversion of the fundamental principle of the Constitution. If the people desire to give Congress the power to regulate industries within the state, and the relations of employers and employees in those industries, they are at liberty to declare their will in the appropriate manner, but it is not for the Court to amend the Constitution by judicial decision.\n I also agree that subdivision (g) of part 3 of the prescribed Code ( 15 U.S.C.A.  808(g) is invalid upon three counts: (1) It attempts a broad delegation of legislative power to fix hours and wages without standards of limitation. The government invokes the analogy of legislation which becomes effective on the happening of a specified event, and says that in this case the event is the agreement of a certain proportion of producers and employees, whereupon the other producers and employees become subject to legal obligations accordingly. I think that the argument is unsound and is pressed to the point where the principle would be entirely destroyed. It would remove all restrictions upon the delegation of legislative power, as the making of laws could thus be referred to any designated officials or private persons whose orders or agreements would be treated as 'events,' with the result that they would be invested with the force of law having penal sanctions. (2) The provision permits a group of producers and employees, according to their own views of expediency, to make rules as to hours and wages for other producers and employees who were not parties to the agreement. Such a provision, apart from the mere question of the delegation of legislative power, is not in accord with the requirement of due process of law which under the Fifth Amendment dominates the regulations which Congress may impose. (3) The provision goes beyond any proper measure of protection of interstate \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 319]\n\u00a0\n commerce and attempts a broad regulation of industry within the state.\n But that is not the whole case. The act also provides for the regulation of the prices of bituminous coal sold in interstate commerce and prohibits unfair methods of competition in interstate commerce. Undoubtedly transactions in carrying on interstate commerce are subject to the federal power to regulate that commerce and the control of charges and the protection of fair competition in that commerce are familiar illustrations of the exercise of the power, as the Interstate Commerce Act ( 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.), the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C.A.  181 et seq.), and the Anti-Trust Acts (15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.) abundantly show. The Court has repeatedly stated that the power to regulate interstate commerce among the several states is supreme and plenary. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 398\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L. R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18. It is 'complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution.' Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196. We are not at liberty to deny to the Congress, with respect to interstate commerce, a power commensurate with that enjoyed by the states in the regulation of their internal commerce. See Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469.\n Whether the policy of fixing prices of commodities sold in interstate commerce is a sound policy is not for our consideration. The question of that policy, and of its particular applications, is for Congress. The exercise of the power of regulation is subject to the constitutional restriction of the due process clause, and if in fixing rates, prices, or conditions of competition, that requirement is transgressed, the judicial power may be invoked to the end that the constitutional limitation may be maintained. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S.Ct. 108; St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 80 L.Ed. --, decided April 27, 1936. \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 320]\n\u00a0\n In the legislation before us, Congress has set up elaborate machinery for the fixing of prices of bituminous coal sold in interstate commerce. That provision is attacked in limine. Prices have not yet been fixed. If fixed, they may not be contested. If contested, the act provides for review of the administrative ruling. If in fixing prices, due process is violated by arbitrary, capricious, on confiscatory action, judicial remedy is available. If an attempt is made to fix prices for sales in intrastate commerce, that attempt will also be subject to attack by appropriate action. In that relation it should be noted that in the Carter cases the court below found that substantially all the coal mined by the Carter Coal Company is sold f.o.b. mines and is transported into states other than those in which it is produced for the purpose of filling orders obtained from purchasers in such states. Such transactions are in interstate commerce. Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 520\n, 32 S.Ct. 715. The court below also found that 'the interstate distribution and sale and the intrastate distribution and sale' of the coal are so 'intimately and inextricably connected' that 'the regulation of interstate transactions of distribution and sale cannot be accomplished effectively without discrimination against interstate commerce unless transactions of intrastate distribution and sale be regulated.' Substantially the same situation is disclosed in the Kentucky cases. In that relation, the government invokes the analogy of transportation rates. Houston, E. & W.T. R. Co. v. U.S. (Shreveport Case), \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086. The question will be the subject of consideration when it arises in any particular application of the act.\n Upon what ground, then, can it be said that this plan for the regulation of transactions in interstate commerce in coal is beyond the constitutional power of Congress? The Court reaches that conclusion in the view that the \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 321]\n\u00a0\n invalidity of the labor provisions requires us to condemn the act in its entirety. I am unable to concur in that opinion. I think that the express provisions of the act preclude such a finding of inseparability.\n This is admittedly a question of statutory construction; and hence we must search for the intent of Congress. And in seeking that intent we should not fail to give full weight to what Congress itself has said upon the very point. That act provides (section 15, 15 U.S.C.A.  819):\n'If any provision of this Act (chapter), or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of the Act ( chapter) and the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.'\n\n That is a flat declaration against treating the provisions of the act as inseparable. It is a declaration which Congress was competent to make. It is a declaration which reverses the presumption of indivisibility and creates an opposite presumption. Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 184\n, 52 S.Ct. 548.\n The above-quoted provision does not stand alone. Congress was at pains to make a declaration of similar import with respect to the provisions of the code (section 3, 15 U.S.C.A.  804):\n'No producer shall by reason of his acceptance of the code provided for in section 4 (sections 805, 806, 807 and 808 of this chapter), or of the drawback of taxes provided in section 3 of this Act (this section) be held to be precluded or estopped from contesting the constitutionality of any provision of said code, or its validity as applicable to such producer.'\n\n This provision evidently contemplates, when read with the one first quoted, that a stipulation of the code may be found to be unconstitutional and yet that its invalidity shall not be regarded as affecting the obligations attaching to the remainder.\n I do not think that the question of separability should be determined by trying to imagine what Congress would \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 322]\n\u00a0\n have done if certain provisions found to be invalid were excised. That, if taken broadly, would lead us into a realm of pure speculation. Who can tell amid the host of divisive influences playing upon the legislative body what its reaction would have been to a particular excision required by a finding of invalidity? The question does not call for speculation of that sort, but rather for an inquiry whether the provisions are inseparable by virtue of inherent character. That is, when Congress states that the provisions of the act are not inseparable and that the invalidity of any provision shall not affect others, we should not hold that the provisions are inseparable unless their nature, by reason of an inextricable tie, demands that conclusion.\n All that is said in the preamble of the act, in the directions to the commission which the act creates, and in the stipulations of the code, is subject to the explicit direction of Congress that the provisions of the statute shall not be treated as forming an indivisible unit. The fact that the various requirements furnish to each other mutual aid and support does not establish indivisibility. The purpose of Congress, plainly expressed, was that if a part of that aid were lost, the whole should not be lost. Congress desired that the act and code should be operative so far as they met the constitutional test. Thus we are brought, as I have said, to the question whether, despite this purpose of Congress, we must treat the marketing provisions and the labor provisions as inextricably tied together because of their nature. I find no such tie. The labor provisions are themselves separated and placed in a separate part (part 3) of the code (15 U.S.C.A.  808). It seems quite clear that the validity of the entire act cannot depend upon the provisions as to hours and wages in paragraph (g) of part 3. For what was contemplated by that paragraph is manifestly independent of \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 323]\n\u00a0\n the other machinery of the act, as it cannot become effective unless the specified proportion of producers and employees reach an agreement as to particular wages and hours. And the provision for collective bargaining in paragraphs (a) and (b) of part 3 is apparently made separable from the code itself by section 9 of the act (15 U.S.C.A.  813), providing, in substance, that the employees of all producers shall have the right of collective bargaining even when producers do not accept or maintain the code.\n The marketing provisions (part 2) of the cod (15 U.S.C.A.  807) naturally form a separate category. The interdependence of wages and prices is no clearer in the coal business than in transportation. But the broad regulation of rates in order to stabilize transportation conditions has not carried with it the necessity of fixing wages. Again, the requirement, in paragraph (a) of part 2 that district boards shall establish prices so as to yield a prescribed 'return per net ton' for each district in a minimum price area, in order 'to sustain the stabilization of wages, working conditions, and maximum hours of labor,' does not link the marketing provisions to the labor provisions by an unbreakable bond. Congress evidently desired stabilization through both the provisions relating to marketing and those relating to labor, but the setting up of the two sorts of requirements did not make the one dependent upon the validity of the other. It is apparent that they are not so interwoven that they cannot have separate operation and effect. The marketing provisions in relation to interstate commerce can be carried out as provided in part 2 without regard to the labor provisions contained in part 3. That fact, in the light of the congressional declaration of separability, should be considered of controlling importance.\n In this view, the act, and the code for which it provides, may be sustained in relation to the provisions for \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 324]\n\u00a0\n marketing in interstate commerce, and the decisions of the courts below, so far as they accomplish that result, should be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO (dissenting in Nos. 636, 649, and 650, and in No. 651 Concurring in the result).\n My conclusions compendiously stated are these:\n\n\n (a)\n Part 2 of the statute sets up a valid system of price-fixing as applied to transactions in interstate commerce and to those in intrastate commerce where interstate commerce is directly or intimately affected. The prevailing opinion holds nothing to the contrary.\n\n\n (b)\n Part 2, with its system of price-fixing, is separable from part 3, which contains the provisions as to labor considered and condemned in the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n (c)\n Part 2 being valid, the complainants are under a duty to come in under the code, and are subject to a penalty if they persist in a refusal.\n\n\n (d)\n The suits are premature in so far as they seek a judicial declaration as to the validity or invalidity of the regulations in respect of labor embodied in part 3. No opinion is expressed either directly or by implication as to those aspects of the case. It will be time enough to consider them when there is the threat or even the possibility of imminent enforcement. If that time shall arrive, protection will be given by clear provisions of the statute (section 3) against any adverse inference flowing from delay or acquiescence.\n\n\n (e)\n The suits are not premature to the extent that they are intended to avert a present wrong, though the wrong upon analysis will be found to be unreal.\n The complainants are asking for a decree to restrain the enforcement of the statute in all or any of its provisions on the ground that it is a void enactment, and void in all its parts. If some of its parts are valid and are separable from others that are or may be void, and if the parts upheld and separated are sufficient to sustain a \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 325]\n\u00a0\n regulatory penalty, the injunction may not issue and hence the suits must fail. There is no need when that conclusion has been reached to stir a step beyond. Of the provisions not considered, some may never take effect, at least in the absence of future happenings which are still uncertain and contingent. Some may operate in one way as to one group and in another way as to others according to particular conditions as yet unknown and unknowable. A decision in advance as to the operation and validity of separable provisions in varying contingencies is premature and hence unwise. 'The Court will not 'anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.' Liverpool, N.Y. & P. Stea ship Co. v. Emigration Commissioners, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 39\n, 5 S.Ct. 352, 355; Abrams v. Van Schaick, \n293 \nU.S. 188\n, 55 S.Ct. 135; Wilshire Oil Co. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 100\n, 55 S.Ct. 673. 'It is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.' Burton v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 283, 295\n, 25 S.Ct. 243, 245.' Per Brandeis, J., in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288\n, 56 S.Ct. 466, 483, February 17, 1936. The moment we perceive that there are valid and separable portions, broad enough to lay the basis for a regulatory penalty, inquiry should halt. The complainants must conform to whatever is upheld, and as to parts excluded from the decision, especially if the parts are not presently effective, must make their protest in the future when the occasion or the need arises.\n First. I am satisfied that the act is within the power of the central government in so far as it provides for minimum and maximum prices upon sales of bituminous coal in the transactions of interstate commerce and in those of intrastate commerce where interstate commerce is directly or intimately affected. Whether it is valid also in other provisions that have been considered and condemned in the opinion of the Court, I do not find it necessary to determine at this time. Silence must not be taken as importing acquiescence. Much would have \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 326]\n\u00a0\n to be written if the subject, even as thus restricted were to be explored through all its implications, historical and economic as well as strictly legal. The fact that the prevailing opinion leaves the price provisions open for consideration in the future makes it appropriate to forego a fullness of elaboration that might otherwise be necessary. As a system of price fixing, the act is challenged upon three grounds: (1) Because the governance of prices is not within the commerce clause; (2) because it is a denial of due process forbidden by the Fifth Amendment; and (3) because the standards for administrative action are indefinite, with the result that there has been an unlawful delegation of legislative power.\n\n\n (1)\n With reference to the first objection, the obvious and sufficient answer is, so far as the act is directed to interstate transactions, that sales made in such conditions constitute interstate commerce, and do not merely 'affect' it. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 290\n, 42 S.Ct. 106; Flanagan v. Federal Coal Co., \n267 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 45 S.Ct. 233; Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50, 60\n, 42 S.Ct. 244; Public Utilities Commission v. Attleboro Steam & Electric Co., \n273 \nU.S. 83, 90\n, 47 S.Ct. 294; Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific States Paper Trade Association, \n273 \nU.S. 52, 64\n, 47 S.Ct. 255. To regulate the price for such transactions is to regulate commerce itself, and not alone it antecedent conditions or its ultimate consequences. The very act of sale is limited and governed. Prices in interstate transactions may not be regulated by the states. Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., \n294 \nU.S. 511\n, 55 S.Ct. 497, 101 A.L.R. 55. They must therefore be subject to the power of the Nation unless they are to be withdrawn altogether from governmental supervision. Cf. Head Money Cases, \n112 \nU.S. 580, 593\n, 5 S.Ct. 247; Story, Commentaries on the Constitution,  1082. If such a vacuum were permitted, many a public evil incidental to interstate transactions would be left without a remedy. This does not mean, of course, that prices may be fixed for arbitrary reasons or in an arbitrary way. The commerce power of the Nation is \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 327]\n\u00a0\n subject to the requirement of due process like the police power of the states. Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146, 156\n, 40 S.Ct. 106; cf. Brooks v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 432, 436\n, 437 S., 45 S.Ct. 345, 37 A.L. . 1407; Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502, 524\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469. Heed must be given to similar considerations of social benefit or detriment in marking the division between reason and oppression. The evidence is overwhelming that congress did not ignore those considerations in the adoption of this act. What is to be said in that regard may conveniently be postponed to the part of the opinion dealing with the Fifth Amendment.\n Regulation of prices being an exercise of the commerce power in respect of interstate transactions, the question remains whether it comes within that power as applied to intrastate sales where interstate prices are directly or intimately affected. Mining and agriculture and manufacture are not interstate commerce considered by themselves, yet their relation to that commerce may be such that for the protection of the one there is need to regulate the other. Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495, 544\n, 545 S., 546, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947. Sometimes it is said that the relation must be 'direct' to bring that power into play. In many circumstances such a description will be sufficiently precise to meet the needs of the occasion. But a great principle of constitutional law is not susceptible of comprehensive statement in an adjective. The underlying thought is merely this, that 'the law is not indifferent to considerations of degree.' Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, supra, concurring opinion, 295 U.S. at page 554, 55 S.Ct. 853, 97 A.L.R. 947. It cannot be indifferent to them without an expansion of the commerce clause that would absorb or imperil the reserved powers of the states. At times, as in the case cited, the waves of causation will have radiated so far that their undulatory motion, if discernible at all, will be too faint or obscure, too broken by cross-currents, to be heeded by the law. In such circum- \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 328]\n\u00a0\n stances the holding is not directed at prices or wages considered in the abstract, but at prices or wages in particular conditions. The relation may be tenuous or the opposite according to the facts. Always the setting of the facts is to be viewed if one would know the closeness of the tie. Perhaps, if one group of adjectives is to be chosen in preference to another, 'intimate' and 'remote' will be found to be as good as any. At all events, 'direct' and 'indirect,' even if accepted as sufficient, must not be read too narrowly. Cf. Stone, J., in Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, \n273 \nU.S. 34, 44\n, 47 S.Ct. 267. A survey of the cases shows that the words have been interpreted with suppleness of adaptation and flexibility of meaning. The power is as broad as the need that evokes it.\n One of the most common and typical instances of a relation characterized as direct has been that between interstate and intrastate rates for carriers by rail where the local rates are so low as to divert business unreasonably from interstate competitors. In such circumstances Congress has the power to protect the business of its carriers against disintegrating encroachments. Houston, E. & W.T.R. Co. v. U.S. (Shreveport Case), \n234 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 352 S., 34 S.Ct. 833; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 588\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086; United States v. Louisiana, \n290 \nU.S. 70, 75\n, 54 S.Ct. 28; Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 603. To be sure, the relation even then may be characterized as indirect if one is nice or over-literal in the choice of words. Strictly speaking, the intrastate rates have a primary effect upon the intrastate traffic and not upon any other, though the repercussions of the competitive system may lead to secondary consequences affecting interstate traffic also. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Florida, \n295 \nU.S. 301, 306\n, 55 S.Ct. 713. What the cases really mean is that the causal relation in such circumstances is so close and intimate and obvious  to permit it to be called direct without subjecting the word to an unfair or excessive strain. There is a like imme- \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 329]\n\u00a0\n diacy here. Within rulings the most orthodox, the prices for intrastate sales of coal have so inescapable a relation to those for interstate sales that a system of regulation for transactions of the one class is necessary to give adequate protection to the system of regulation adopted for the other. The argument is strongly pressed by intervening counsel that this may not be true in all communities or in exceptional conditions. If so, the operators unlawfully affected may show that the act to that extent is invalid as to them. Such partial invalidity is plainly an insufficient basis for a declaration that the act is invalid as a whole. Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, supra, \n257 U.S. 282\n, at page 289, 42 S.Ct. 106; DuPont v. Commissioner, \n289 \nU.S. 685, 688\n, 53 S.Ct. 766.\n What has been said in this regard is said with added certitude when complainants' business is considered in the light of the statistics exhibited in the several records. In No. 636, the Carter case, the complainant has admitted that 'substantially all' (over 97 1\/2 per cent.) of the sales of the Carter Company are made in interstate commerce. In No. 649 the percentages of intrastate sales are, for one of the complaining companies, 25 per cent., for another 1 per cent., and for most of the others 2 per cent. or 4. The Carter Company has its mines in West Virginia; the mines of the other companies are located in Kentucky. In each of those states, moreover, coal from other regions is purchased in large quantities, and is trus brought into competition with the coal locally produced. Plainly, it is impossible to say either from the statute itself or from any figures laid before us that interstate sales will not be prejudicially affected in West Virginia and Kentucky if intrastate prices are maintained on a lower level. If it be assumed for present purposes that there are other states or regions where the effect may be different, the complaints are not the champions of any rights except their own. Hatch v. \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 330]\n\u00a0\n Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 160\n, 161 S., 27 S.Ct. 188, 9 Ann.Cas. 736; Premier-Pabst Sales Co. v. Grosscup (May 18, 1936) \n298 \nU.S. 226\n, 56 S. Ct. 754, 80 L.Ed. --.\n\n\n (2)\n The commerce clause being accepted as a sufficient source of power, the next inquiry must be whether the power has been exercised consistently with the Fifth Amendment. In the pursuit of that inquiry, Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469, lays down the applicable principle. There a statute of New York prescribing a minimum price for milk was upheld against the objection that price-fixing was forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n1\n We found it a sufficient reason to uphold the challenged system that 'the conditions or practices in an industry make unrestricted competition an inadequate safeguard of the consumer's interests, produce waste harmful to the public, threaten ultimately to cut off the supply of a commodity needed by the public, or portend the destruction of the industry itself.' \n291 U.S. 502\n, at page 538, 54 S.Ct. 505, 516, 89 A.L.R. 1469.\n All this may be said, and with equal, if not greater force, of the conditions and practices in the bituminous coal industry, not only at the enactment of this statute in August, 1935, but for many years before. Overproduction was at a point where free competition had been degraded into anarchy. Prices had been cut so low that profit had become impossible for all except a lucky \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 331]\n\u00a0\n handful. Wages came down along with prices and with profits. There were strikes, at times nation-wide in extent, at other times spreading over broad areas and many mines, with the accompaniment of violence and bloodshed and misery and bitter feeling. The sordid tale is unfolded in many a document and treatise. During the twenty-three years between 1913 and 1935, there were nineteen investigations or hearings by Congress or by specially created commissions with reference to conditions in the coal mines. \n2\n The hope of betterment was faint unless the industry could be subjected to the compulsion of a code. In the weeks immediately preceding the passage of this act the country was threatened once more with a strike of ominous proportions. The plight of the industry was not merely a menace to owners and to mine workers, it was and had long been a menace to the public, deeply concerned in a steady and uniform supply of a fuel so vital to the national economy.\n Congress was not condemned to inaction in the face of price wars and wage wars so pregnant with disaster. Commerce had been choked and burdened; its normal flow had been diverted from one state to another; there had been bankruptcy and waste and ruin alike for capital and for labor. The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment does not include the right to persist in this anarchic riot. 'When industry is grievously hurt, when producing concerns fail, when unemployment mounts and communities dependent upon profitable production are prostrated, the wells of commerce go dry.' Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344, 372\n, 53 S.Ct. 471, 478. The free competition so often figured as a social good imports order and moderation and a decent regard for the welfare of the group. Cf. Sugar Institute, Inc., v. \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 332]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n297 \nU.S. 553\n, 56 S.Ct. 629, March 30, 1936. There is testimony in these records, testimony even by the assailants of the statute, that only through a system of regulated prices can the industry be stabilized and set upon the road of orderly and peaceful progress. \n3\n If further facts are looked for, they are narrated in the findings as well as in Congressional Reports and a mass of public records. 4 After making every allowance for difference of opinion as to the most efficient cure, the student of the subject is confronted with the indisputable truth that there were ills to be corrected, and ills that had a direct relation to the maintenance of commerce among the states without friction or diversion. An evil existing, and also the power to correct it, the lawmakers were at liberty to use their own discretion in the selection of the means. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n (3)\n Finally, and in answer to the third objection to the statute in its price-fixing provisions, there has been no excessive delegation of legislative power. The prices \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 333]\n\u00a0\n to be fixed by the district boards and the commission must conform to the following standards: They must be just and equitable; they must take account of the weighted average cost of production for each minimum price area; they must not be unduly prejudicial or preferential as between districts or as between producers within a district; and they must reflect as nearly as possible the relative market value of the various kinds, qualities, and sizes of coal, at points of delivery in each common consuming market area; to the end of affording the producers in the several districts substantially the same opportunity to dispose of their coals on a competitive basis as has heretofore existed. The minimum for any district shall yield a return, per net ton, not less than the weighted average of the total costs per net ton of the tonnage of the minimum price area; the maximum for any mine, if a maximum is fixed, shall yield a return not less than cost plus a reasonable profit. Reasonable prices can as easily be ascertained for coal as for the carriage of passengers or property under the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.), or for the services of brokers in the stockyards (Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420\n, 50 S.Ct. 220), or for the use of dwellings under the Emergency Rent Laws (Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135, 157\n, 41 S.Ct. 458, 16 A.L.R. 165; Marcus Brown Co. v. Feldman, \n256 \nU.S. 170\n, 41 S.Ct. 465; Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, \n258 \nU.S. 242\n, 42 S.Ct. 289), adopted at a time of excessive scarcity, when the laws of supply and demand no longer gave a measure for the ascertainment of the reasonable. The standards established by this act are quite as definite as others that have had the approval of this court. New York Central Securities Corporation v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 53 S.Ct. 45; Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Bros. Bond & Mortgage Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 286\n, 53 S.Ct. 627; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra; Mahler v. Eby, \n264 \nU.S. 32\n, 44 S.Ct. 283. Certainly a bench of judges, not experts in the coal business, cannot \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 334]\n\u00a0\n say with assurance that members of a commission will be unable, when advised and informed by others experienced in the industry, to make the standards workable, or to overcome through the development of an administrative technique many obstacles and difficulties that might be baffling or confusing to inexperience or ignorance.\n The price provisions of the act are contained in a chapter known as section 4, part 2 (15 U.S.C.A.  807). The final subdivisions of that part enumerate certain forms of conduct which are denounced as 'unfair methods of competition.' For the most part, the prohibitions are ancillary to the fixing of a minimum price. The power to fix a price carries with it the subsidiary power to forbid and prevent evasion. Cf. United States v. Ferger, \n250 \nU.S. 199\n, 39 S.Ct. 445. The few prohibitions that may be viewed as separate are directed t situations that may never be realized in practice. None of the complainants threatens or expresses the desire to do these forbidden acts. As to those phases of the statute, the suits are premature.\n Second. The next inquiry must be whether section 4, part 1 of the statute (15 U.S.C.A.  806) which creates the administrative agencies, and part 2 (15 U.S.C.A.  807), which has to do in the main with the price- fixing machinery, as well as preliminary sections levying a tax or penalty, are separable from part 3 (15 U.S.C.A.  808), which deals with labor relations in the industry with the result that what is earlier would stand if what is later were to fall.\n The statute prescribes the rule by which construction shall be governed. 'If any provision of this Act (chapter), or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of the Act (chapter) and the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.' Section 15, 15 U.S.C.A.  819. The rule is not read as an inexorable mandate. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 44 S.Ct. 323; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, 286 \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 335]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 165, 184, 52 S.Ct. 548; Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 330, 362\n, 55 S.Ct. 758. It creates a 'presumption of divisibility,' which is not applied mechanically or in a manner to frustrate the intention of the law-makers. Even so, the burden is on the litigant who would escape its operation, Here the probabilities of intention are far from overcoming the force of the presumption. They fortify and confirm it. A confirmatory token is the formal division of the statute into 'parts' separately numbered. Part 3 which deals with labor is physically separate from everything that goes before it. But more convincing than the evidences of form and structure, the division into chapters and sections and paragraphs, each with its proper subject matter, are the evidences of plan and function. Part 2, which deals with prices, is to take effect at once, or as soon as the administrative agencies have finished their administrative work. Part 3 in some of its most significant provisions, the section or subdivision in respect of wages and the hours of labor, may never take effect at all. This is clear beyond the need for argument from the mere reading of the statute. The maximum hours of labor may be fixed by agreement between the producers of more than two-thirds of the annual national tonnage production for the preceding calendar year and the representatives of more than one-half the mine workers. Wages may be fixed by agreement or agreement negotiated by collective bargaining in any district or group of two or more districts between representatives of producers of more than two-thirds of the annual tonnage production of such districts or each of such districts in a contracting group during the preceding calendar year, and representatives of the majority of the mine workers therein. It is possible that none of these agreements as to hours and wages will ever be made. If made, they may not be completed for months or even years. In the meantime, however, the provi- \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 336]\n\u00a0\n sions of part 2 will be continuously operative, and will determine prices in the industry. Plainly, then, there was no intention on the part of the framers of the statute that prices should not be fixed if the provisions for wages or hours of labor were found to be invalid.\n Undoubtedly the rules as to labor relations are important provisions of the statute. Undoubtedly the lawmakers were anxious that provisions so important should have the force of law. But they announced with all the directness possible for words that they would keep what they could have if they could not have the whole. Stabilizing prices would go a long way toward stabilizing labor relations by giving the producers capacity to pay a living wage. \n6\n To hold otherwise is to ignore the whole history of mining. All in vain have offici l committees \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 337]\n\u00a0\n inquired and reported in thousands of printed pages if this lesson has been lost. In the face of that history the Court is now holding that Congress would have been unwilling to give the force of law to the provisions of part 2, which were to take effect at once, if it could not have part 3, which in the absence of agreement between the employers and the miners would never take effect at all. Indeed, the prevailing opinion goes so far, it seems, as to insist that if the least provision of the statute in any of the three chapters is to be set aside as void, the whole statute must go down, for the reason that everything from end to end, or everything at all events beginning with section 4, is part of the Bituminous Coal Code, to be swallowed at a single draught, without power in the commission or even in the court to abate a jot or tittle. One can only wonder what is left of the 'presumption of divisibility' which the lawmakers were at pains to establish later on. Codes under the National Recovery Act (48 Stat. 195) are not a genuine analogy. The Recovery Act made it mandatory (section 7a (15 U.S.C.A.  707(a))) that every code should contain provisions as to labor, including wages and hours, and left everything else to the discretion of the codifiers. Wages and hours in such circumstances were properly described as 'essential features of the plan, its very bone and sinew' (Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, supra, concurring opinion, 295 U.S. at page 555, 55 S.Ct. 854, 97 A.L.R. 947), which taken from the body of a code would cause it to collapse. Here on the face of the statute the price provisions of one part and the labor provisions of the other (the two to be administered by separate agencies) are made of equal rank.\n What is true of the sections and subdivisions that deal with wages and the hours of labor is true also of the other provisions of the same chapter of the act. Employees are to have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choos- \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 338]\n\u00a0\n ing, and shall be free from interference, restraint, or coercion of employers, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives, or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and no employee and no one seeking employment shall be required as a condition of employment to join any company union. No threat has been made by any one to do violence to the enjoyment of these immunities and privileges. No attempt to violate them may be made by the complainants or indeed by any one else in the term of four years during which the act is to remain in force. By another subdivision employees are to have the right of peaceable assemblage for the discussion of the principles of collective bargaining, shall be entitled to select their own check-weighman to inspect the weighing or measuring of coal, and shall not be required as a condition of employment to live in company houses or to trade at the store of the employer. None of these privileges or immunities has been threatened with impairment. No attempt to impair them may ever be made by any one.\n Analysis of the statute thus leads to the conclusion that the provisions of part 3, so far as summarized, are separable from parts 1 and 2, and that any declaration in respect of their validity or invalidity under the commerce clause of the Constitution or under any other section will anticipate a controversy that may never become real. This being so, the proper course is to withhold an expression of opinion until expression becomes necessary. A different situation would be here if a portion of the statute, and a portion sufficient to uphold the regulatory penalty, did not appear to be valid. If the whole statute were a nullity, the complainants would be at liberty to stay the hand of the tax-gatherer threatening to collect the penalty, for collection in such circumstances would be a trespass, an illegal and forbidden act. Child Labor \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 339]\n\u00a0\n Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S.Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432; Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 62\n, 42 S.Ct. 453; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 215\n, 44 S.Ct. 15; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510, 536\n, 45 S.Ct. 571, 39 A.L.R. 468. It would be no answer to say that the complainants might avert the penalty by declaring themselves code members (section 3) and fighting the statute afterwards. In the circumstances supposed there would be no power in the national government to put that constraint upon them. The act by hypothesis being void in all its parts as a regulatory measure, the complainants might stand their ground, refuse to sign anything, and resist the onslaught of the collector as the aggression of a trespasser. But the case as it comes to us assumes a different posture, a posture inconsistent with the commission of a trespass either present or prospective. The hypothesis of complete invalidity has been shown to be unreal. The price provisions being valid, the complainants were under a duty to come in under the code, whether the provisions as to labor are valid or invalid, and their failure to come in has exposed them to a penalty lawfully imposed. They are thus in no position to restrain the acts of the collector, or to procure a judgment defeating the operation of the statute, whatever may be the fate hereafter of particular provisions not presently enforceable. The right to an injunction failing, the suits must be dismissed. Nothing more is needful-no pronouncement more elaborate-for a disposition of the controversy.\n A last assault upon the statute is still to be repulsed. The complainants take the ground that the act may not coerce them through the imposition of a penalty into a seeming recognition or acceptance of the code, if any of the code provisions are invalid, however separable from others. I cannot yield assent to a position so extreme. It is one thing to impose a penalty for refusing to come in under a code that is void altogether. It is a very different thing if a penalty is imposed for \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 340]\n\u00a0\n refusing to come in under a code invalid at the utmost in separable provisions, not immediately operative, the right to contest them being explicitly reserved. The penalty in those circumstances is adopted as a lawful sanction to compel submission to a statute having the quality of law. A sanction of that type is the one in controversy here. So far as the provisions for collective bargaining and freedom from coercion are concerned, the same duties are imposed upon employers by section 9 of the statute (15 U.S.C.A.  813) whether they come in under the code or not. So far as code members are subject to regulation as to wages and hours of labor, the force of the complainants' argument is destroyed when reference is made to those provisions of the statute in which the effect of recognition and acceptance is explained and limited. By section 3 of the act, 'No producer shall by reason of his acceptance of the code provided for in section 4 (sections 805, 806, 807 and 808 of this chapter) or of the drawback of taxes provided in section 3 of this Act (this section) be held to be precluded or estopped from contesting the constitutionality of any provision of said code, or its validity as applicable to such producer.' These provisions are reinforced and made more definite by sections 5(c) and 6(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  809(c), 810(b), which so far as presently material are quoted in the margin. 7 For the subscriber to the code who is \n\n[298 U.S. 238, 341]\n\u00a0\n doubtful as to the validity of some of its requirements, there is thus complete protection. If this might otherwise be uncertain, it would be made clear by our decision in Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764, which was applied in the court below at the instance and for the benefit of one of these complainants to give relief against penalties accruing during suit. Helvering v. Carter, No. 651. Finally, the adequacy of the remedial devices is made even more apparent when one remembers that the attack upon the statute in its labor regulations assumes the existence of a controversy that may never become actual. The failure to agree upon a wage scale or upon maximum hours of daily or weekly labor may make the statutory scheme abortive in the very phases and aspects that the court has chosen to condemn. What the code will provide as to wages and hours of labor, or whether it will provide anything, is still in the domain of prophecy. The opinion of the Court begins at the wrong end. To adopt a homely form of words, the complainants have been crying before they are really hurt.\n My vote is for affirmance.\n I am authorized to state that Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Hamilton v.

Veasey, both of Tulsa, Okl., for respondents.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n John Wadsworth, enrolled as a Seminole Indian, died on August 3, 1907, after selecting his allotment and prior \n\n[299 U.S. 30, 31]\n\u00a0\n to the admission of Oklahoma to statehood. Surviving him were his mother, brothers, and sisters, enrolled as Seminoles, and his wife and three children enrolled as Creeks. In an action to quiet title, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma affirmed a judgment sustaining demurrers to the petition. 175 Okl. 494, 53 P.(2d) 549. The Court said: 'For twenty-five years it has been the settled rule of law in this state, in reliance upon which the stability and dependability of titles has depended, that the allotted land of a Seminole Indian, who died (1) after selecting his allotment and (2) before statehood, descended to his heirs, in accordance with the Arkansas laws of descent and distribution (Crawford & Moses' Dig.  3471 et seq.), without regard to the above limitation to tribal citizens. ... There is some merit in the assertion of plaintiffs in error that the first pronouncement of the rule, in Bruner v. Sanders, 26 Okl. 673, 110 P. 730, decided in the year 1910, is dictum. Nevertheless, if it was dictum, it was repeatedly followed by subsequent decisions of this court wherein it emerged from the real of dictum into the point actually decided. Those cases are Heliker-Jarvis Seminole Co. v. Lincoln, 33 Okl. 425, 126 P. 723; Thorn v. Cone, 47 Okl. 781, 150 P. 701; Rentie v. Rentie, 70 Okl. 103, 172 P. 1083; Dickinson v.

In the same suit, on the receiver's application, the court ordered an assessment of 100 per cent. upon the shares of stock of the corporation, in order to enforce the provisions of the Minnesota Constitution and laws relating to the double liability of stockholders. Minn.Const. art. 10,  3; Mason's Minn.St.1927,  8025, 8026; and  8027, 8028, as amended by Laws Minn.1931, c. 205,  1, 2. The order was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Saetre v. Chandler, 57 F.(2d) 951.\n The receiver brought the present suit in the state court of Colorado against respondent John Peketz, a resident of that state and alleged to be a stockholder in the corporation. Respondent demurred to the complaint upon the ground that the action of the District Court in Minnesota was not binding upon him. The demurrer was sustained, the suit was dismissed, and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Colorado against the contention of the receiver that full faith and credit had been denied to the order of assessment. Compare Hancock National Bank v. Farnum, \n176 \nU.S. 640, 645\n, 20 S.Ct. 506. The state court held that since respondent was not served with process in Minnesota, the court ordering the assessment acquired no jurisdiction over his person, and that the procedure provided by the laws of Minnesota in the interest of nonresident stockholders had not been followed. This Court granted certiorari. \n296 \nU.S. 571\n, 56 S.Ct. 369.\n The legislation of Minnesota with respect to the liability of stockholders has been reviewed and its constitutional validity has been sustained by this Court. Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516\n, 27 S.Ct. 755; Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243\n, 32 S.Ct. 415, Ann.Cas.1913D, 1292; Selig v. Hamilton, \n234 \nU.S. 652, 660\n, 34 S. Ct. 926, Ann.Cas.1917A, 104; Marin v. Augedahl, \n247 \nU.S. 142\n, 38 S.Ct. 452. We have had held that the Minnesota provisions constituted a reasonable regulation for enforcing the liability assumed by those who became stockholders in corporations organized under the laws of that state; that the order levying the assessment is made conclusive as to all matters relating to the amount and \n\n[297 U.S. 609, 611]\n\u00a0\n propriety thereof, and the necessity therefor; that it is thus conclusive, although the stockholder may not have been a party to the suit in which it was made or notified that an assessment was contemplated, as the order is not in the nature of a personal judgment against him and he must be deemed, by virtue of his relation to the corporation and the obligation assumed with respect to its debts, to be represented by it in the proceeding; and, further, that one against whom the order of assessment is sought to be enforced is not precluded from showing that he is not a stockholder, or is not the holder of as many shares as is alleged, or has a claim against the corporation which in law or in equity he is entitled to set off against the assessment, or has any other defense personal to himself.\n These defenses respondent was entitled to assert in the suit bro ght against him by the receiver in Colorado. But the present question relates not to any such defense, as none was asserted, but to the binding quality of the order of assessment. The particulars of procedure in the Minnesota suit, which the court in Colorado found faulty, were these. The petition for assessment was filed by the receiver in the Minnesota suit on July 10, 1931. The proceeding was entertained and the court entered an order setting the matter for hearing on August 31, 1931. Notice was mailed on July 25, 1931, to all stockholders, including respondent, the notice being sent to his address at Denver. On August 18, 1931, the court in Minnesota made an order continuing the hearing to September 10, 1931. On August 19, 1931, notice of the hearing on the adjourned date was mailed to each stockholder, including respondent. The state court in Colorado took the view that the Minnesota statute required that the court in proceedings for an assessment shall 'appoint a time for hearing, not less than thirty nor more than sixty days' after the order appointing the \n\n[297 U.S. 609, 612]\n\u00a0\n hearing, and that by reason of the adjournment the hearing was not had within the time which the statute prescribed. Another objection was that the Minnesota laws required the court in ordering an assessment to designate a period for payment, that is, that payment should be directed 'within the time specified in such order.' Mason's Minn.St.1927,  8026, supra. The order in question required the stockholders to pay the assessment 'forthwith' and directed the receiver 'forthwith' to institute suits to recover the amounts assessed, with interest to run from thirty days after the date of the order.\n The Court is of the opinion that neither of these objections go to the jurisdiction of the District Court in Minnesota in making the assessment. That jurisdiction attached when the petition of the receiver was filed in accordance with the statute. Neither the order for continuing the hearing, nor the provision directing payment, can properly be regarded as ousting that jurisdiction. Errors or procedural irregularities, if any, were subject to correction by the court itself or upon appeal, but afforded no warrant for collateral attack upon the order. Rose v.

HOAGE(1936)\nNo. 151\nArgued: Decided: January 6, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 526, 527]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harlan Wood, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. G. Bowdoin Craighill, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on certiorari, \n296 \nU.S. 554\n, 56 S.Ct. 103, to resolve a question arising under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act of March 4, 1927, 44 Stat. 1424 (see 33 U.S.C.A .  901 et seq.) made applicable to the District of Columbia by the Act of May 17, 1928, 45 Stat. 600 (33 U.S.C.A.  901 note, D.C.Code 1929, T. 19 ,  11, 12). \n\n[296 U.S. 526, 528]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner sought, in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, a mandatory injunction directing respondent, a Deputy Commissioner of the District of Columbia Compensation District, to award him compensation. In the proceedings in that court it appeared that petitioner had been injured in a collision with a street car, in the course of his employment as helper on a delivery truck of his employer, for whom the respondent the Indemnity Insurance Company of North America, intervener in the suit, is the insurance carrier; that petitioner, electing to sue the street car company, had recovered judgment in the District Supreme Court, which the District Court of Appeals had reversed and remanded for further proceedings, Washington Ry. & Electric Co. v. Chapman, 62 App.D.C. 140, 65 F.(2d) 486; that petitioner had then discontinued his suit and pressed his application for compensation before the Deputy Commissioner, who denied it on the ground that petitioner had failed to pursue to final judgment his remedy against the third party. The present suit was dismissed by the District Supreme Court on motion of the Insurance Company. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 64 App.D.C. 349, 78 F.(2d) 233, holding that, as the petitioner had elected to pursue his remedy against the third party, and as the statute of limitations had run while the suit was pending, his failure to proceed to final judgment operated to discharge the employer and the insurance carrier.\n While by section 33(a) of the Compensation Act (33 U.S.C.A.  933(a) the employee may elect to pursue his remedy against a third person, election does not deprive him of his right to compensation. See American Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co. v. Lowe (C.C.A.) 70 F.(2d) 616. By section 33(f) (33 U.S.C.A.  933(f), the employer or the insurance carrier who, by sections 32(a), 35, and 36 (33 U.S.C.A.  932(a), 935, 936) is substituted for the employer, remains liable for any amount by which the recovery against the third person falls short of the prescribed compensation. Section 33(g) only pro- \n\n[296 U.S. 526, 529]\n\u00a0\n vides for release of the employer's liability for compensation when the claim against the third party is compromised without the employer's consent. In other respects, his rights and liabilities, so far as he is in the position of a surety or indemnitor, are governed, as the court below held, by the general principles of suretyship.\n Upon election of the employee to take compensation, the employer is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the employee against the third person. The insurer, who, as an indemnitor of the employer, and, by the act, stands in the place of the employer, is similarly entitled to subrogation. As with other indemnitors, his obligation may be discharged by release or other relinquishment of the principal liability which deprives him of his right of subrogation. AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Moses, \n287 \nU.S. 530\n, 53 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 647; Doleman v. Levine, \n295 \nU.S. 221, 225\n, 55 S.Ct. 741; Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Great Lakes Engineering Works Co. (C.C.A.) 184 F. 426, 36 L.R.A.(N.S.) 60. Hence the only question for decision is whether the abandonment by plaintiff of his suit against the third party, after the running of the statute of limitations had precluded the possibility of bringing another suit, and in the circumstances disclosed by the record, is to be deemed so prejudicial to the insurer's right of subrogation as to operate as a discharge of its liability.\n Whether, in any case, an indemnitor is discharged by the mere failure of his obligee to sue the principal debtor until suit is barred by the statute of limitations, remains an open question in this court. See Nelson v. First Nat. Bank (C.C.A.) 69 F. 798; Gill v. Waterhouse (C.C.A.) 245 F. 75, answering it in the negative; contra: Hayward v. Sencenbaugh, 141 Ill. App. 395; Auchampaugh v. Schmidt, 70 Iowa, 642, 27 N.W. 805, 59 Am.Rep. 459; Mulvane v. Sedgley, 63 Kan. 105, 64 P. 1038, 55 L.R.A. 552; Johnson v. Success Brick March. Co., 104 Miss. 217, 61 So. 178, 62 So. 4; and see Cheesman v. Cheesman, 236 N.Y. 47, 51, 139 N.E. 775. It is unnecessary to decide it now. We assume for present purposes \n\n[296 U.S. 526, 530]\n\u00a0\n that petitioner's election to sue the third party followed by his discontinuance of the suit when the claim was barred by the statute is sufficient to discharge respondent from its obligation as an insurer, if prejudicial to its right of subrogation. We confine our investigation to the questions whether the fact of prejudice to this right is open to inquiry, and, if so, whether the right is shown in the present circumstances to be so unsubstantial that respondent has not in fact been p ejudiced by its loss.\n It is generally true that the obligation of a voluntary surety is so far regarded as strictissimi juris as to be released upon a showing, without more, that the principal obligation has been modified or surrendered without the consent of the surety. Sprigg v. Bank of Mt. Pleasant, 14 Pet. 201; Wood v. Steele, 6 Wall. 80; Porto Rico v. Title Guaranty & Surety Co., \n227 \nU.S. 382\n, 33 S.Ct. 362; Edwards v. Goode (C.C.A.) 228 F. 664; United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Pensacola (C.C.A.) 263 F. 344. But the strictness of this rule is relaxed in those jurisdictions where the failure of the creditor to prosecute his claim against the principal debtor after demand by the surety may be availed of as a defense by the latter. In that case the surety is discharged only to the extent of the loss which results. Pain v. Packard, 13 Johns. (N.Y.) 174, 7 Am.Dec. 369; Huffman v. Hulbert, 13 Wend.(N.Y.) 377; Herrick v. Borst, 4 Hill (N.Y.) 650; Hunt v. Purdy, 82 N.Y. 486, 37 Am.Rep. 587; see Snow v. Horgan, 18 R.I. 289, 291, 27 A. 338; cf. Pickens v. Yarborough's Adm'r, 26 Ala. 417, 62 Am.Dec. 728; Wurster v. Albrecht, 237 Ill.App. 284; Bingham v. Mears, 4 N.D. 437, 61 N.W. 808, 27 L.R.A. 257; Thompson v. Watson, 10 Yerg.(Tenn.) 362; but cf. Shehan v. Hampton, 8 Ala. 942; Shenandoah Nat. Bank v. Ayres, 87 Iowa, 526, 54 N.W. 367; Sullivan v. Dwyer (Tex.Civ.App.) 42 S.W. 355.\n This follows from the fact that the surety's contract, not being one of guaranty, does not entitle him to have the creditor first assert his claim against the principal debtor. \n\n[296 U.S. 526, 531]\n\u00a0\n Failure by the creditor to perform any obligation to prosecute the claim arising out of his conduct subsequent to the contract, like his failure to realize upon subsequently acquired security, is a defense only so far as it is prejudicial to the surety. See State Bank v. Edwards, 20 Ala. 512; Curan v. Colbert, 3 Ga. 239, 46 Am.Dec. 427; Brown v. Executors of Riggins, 3 Ga. 405; Robeson v. Roberts, 20 Ind. 155, 83 Am.Dec. 308; Mt. Sterling Improvement Co. v. Cockrell, 70 S.W. 842, 24 Ky.Law Rep. 1151; Springer v. Toothaker, 43 Me. 381, 69 Am.Dec. 66; Humphrey v. Hitt, 6 Grat.(Va.) 509, 52 Am.Dec. 133; Hyde v. Rogers, 59 Wis. 154, 17 N.W. 127. The analogy to the present case, where the employee was not bound to proceed against the third person, but elected to do so, is apparent.\n Moreover, respondent is a compensated surety, whose premiums the employer is required to pay by section 32 (33 U.S.C.A.  932). The rule that any modification of the principal obligation releases the surety is also abated in the case of a compensated surety or indemnitor, who is discharged only so far as his right is shown to be in fact prejudiced by action of the indemnitee. One who engages in the business of insurance for compensation may properly be held more rigidly to his obligation to indemnify the insured than one whose suretyship is an undertaking uncompensated and casual.

Golden Pressed & Fire Brick Co., \n191 \nU.S. 416\n, 24 S.Ct. 142. The insurer is given a right of subrogation, not to enable him to avoid his undertaking to indemnify, but that it may not be enlarged beyond that of indemnity. Standard Marine Insurance Co. v. Scottish \n\n[296 U.S. 526, 532]\n\u00a0\n Metropolitan Assurance Co., Ltd., \n283 \nU.S. 284, 288\n, 51 S.Ct. 371. He is not prejudiced by failure to prosecute a claim after it has been demonstrated to be groundless.\n Application of these pr nciples to an insurance contract under a compensation act such as the present does not require that an employee who has elected to proceed against a third person do more than prosecute his claim in a manner and to an extent which will avoid prejudice to the insurer's right of subrogation. The facts disclosed show that respondent has not been prejudiced. The judgment upon the first trial was set aside by the Court of Appeals because uncontradicted evidence established petitioner's contributory negligence so clearly that the trial judge should have directed a verdict for the defendant. The appellate court was nevertheless required by the rule of Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n228 \nU.S. 364\n, 33 S.Ct. 523, Ann.Cas. 1914D, 1029, to remand the case for further proceedings. Meanwhile, petitioner's main witness, the driver of the truck, had died. Petitioner, who was without funds, asked leave of the trial court to proceed with the second trial in forma pauperis, with the evident purpose of preserving, by this course, his rights against the insurer. His application was denied, presumably because it was thought a second trial would be fruitless. These circumstances are enough to establish, at least prima facie, that failure to proceed with a second trial did not prejudice the insurer. Respondent, insisting that it was discharged by the mere failure of petitioner to proceed further, regardless of prejudice, has offered no evidence that it did.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO GREAT WESTERN RY. CO. v. RAMBO(1936)\nNo. 696\nArgued: April 1, 1936Decided: April 27, 1936\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry S. Stearns, of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harold E. Stassen, of South St. Paul, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n Half an hour after sunset (5:10), December 8, 1933, respondent's intestate, a signal maintainer, while riding his gasoline speeder over the rails, was run down and killed 3 miles south of Hampton, Minn., by petitioner's passenger train from Minneapolis, moving down grade 60 miles per hour. Darkness had come; the weather was cloudy; the train late; an hour earlier it had collided with a truck and killed a man.\n Relying upon the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A. c. 2 ,  51-59, and the Boiler Inspection Act as \n\n[298 U.S. 99, 100]\n\u00a0\n amended by Act June 7, 1924, 45 U.S.C.A. c. 1,  22-34, respondent sued for damages in Dakota county district court. The jury found for her; judgment upon the verdict was affirmed by the Supreme Court.\n Several acts of negligence were alleged, but the trial court submitted only one to the jury: Failure to equip the locomotive with a headlight of the illuminating power required by federal law.\n Section 23 of the Boiler Inspection Act is in the margin. \n1\n Under permission of that act, the Interstate Commerce Commission adopted the following rule:\n'129. Each locomotive used in road service between sunset and sunrise shall have a headlight which shall afford sufficient illumination to enable a person in the cab of such locomotive who possesses the usual visual capacity required of locomotive enginemen to see in a clear atmosphere, a dark object as large as a man of average size standing erect at a distance of at least 800 feet ahead and in front of such headlight; and such headlight must be maintained in good condition.'\n\n The Supreme Court declared: 'Since there was no motion for new trial, the assignments of error reach only the question whether there is any substantial evidence in support of the judgment. As stated, the sole act of negligence upon which the jury could base a recovery, \n\n[298 U.S. 99, 101]\n\u00a0\n under the charge of the court was a violation of the quoted rule as to headlight; and, if defendant was negligent in that respect, is there sufficient evidence that the deficient headlight was the proximate cause of Rambo's death? The quantum of proof must measure up to the rule clearly and adequately stated in Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Groeger, \n266 \nU.S. 521\n, 45 S.Ct. 169.' It held the evidence adequate.\n In cases like this we must examine the record and determine for ourselves whether as matter of law there is enough to sustain a finding of negligence. Chicago, M. & St. Paul R. Co. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472, 474\n, 46 S.Ct. 564; Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. Saxon, \n284 \nU.S. 458, 459\n, 52 S.Ct. 229.\n The following excerpt from its opinion indicates the view of the Supreme Court.\n'It is true that there is direct proof that the headlight was inspected at the time the locomotive was attached to the train in Minneapolis and when it arrived at its destination at Oelwein, Iowa, and that it then satisfied the requirement of rule 129; also, that it was burning brightly when the train passed Hampton and shortly after the accident, when the chief electrician of defendant, who happened to be on the train, having walked to the front thereof when the emergency stop was made, ascertained, and so testified at the trial, that the track ahead was illuminated properly for more than 800 feet. But this notwithstanding, we think there are facts testified to which authorized the jury in finding that the headlight did not comply with the standard fixed under the Federal Boiler Inspection Act. Most persuasive of this is the testimony of the engineer himself, who testified that he was watching the straight track ahead but could see no object thereon until he was within 500 feet of what he took to be a couple of dogs, and not until he came 100 or more feet nearer could he make out that it was a man on a speeder. There is no suggestion that the engineer did not have the visual \n\n[298 U.S. 99, 102]\n\u00a0\n capacity required of locomotive engineers. The fact that Rambo was seen to make no move to leave the speeder indicates that the headlight did not cast its rays sufficiently around where he was so as to give warning of the approach of the train. There is evidence to show that a person on a running speeder can quickly and without great danger swing himself clear of the rails. Then there is the testimony of a fifteen year old lad, who lived adjacent to the track where Rambo was run down and who witnessed the accident, that while he heard a speeder coming he could not see it until the train which he heard and saw approaching came within about 100 feet of the speeder, when the headlight disclosed its presence to him, and that when he heard the blasts of the whistle and saw the sparks from the application of the brakes the locomotive was less than 50 feet from the speeder. It is thought that the testimony of the engineer that the illumination of the headlight was so deficient that he could not ascertain what the object ahead of him on the track was until he was within 300 feet thereof, corroborated by the fact that the rays of light were not sufficient to arouse the attention of Rambo to the presence of the locomotive, and the testimony of the lad who witnessed the accident standing a few rods from the track, that he, although knowing that both train and speeder were approaching, could not see the speeder until the headlight was within 100 feet thereof, justify the jury in finding that the headlight did not comply with the requirements of the Federal Boiler Inspection Act.'\n\n This apprizement of the evidence, we think, is not well founded. Properly interpreted, the record fails to establish that the headlight fell below the prescribed standard. The argument for re pondent dwells too hard on conjecture. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. Saxon, supra, \n284 U.S. 458\n, at page 460, 52 S.Ct. 229. \n\n[298 U.S. 99, 103]\n\u00a0\n The most important bit of evidence was given by the engineer, called as a witness for respondent. In substance it follows: 'I saw something down on the track, at first when I noticed it, I thought it was a dog or two running down the track, when I got a little closer, I discovered it was a speeder, and I pulled the whistle. I gave a number of short blasts and the man on the speeder never turned or looked.' 'It (the object) might have been eight or nine (railroad) car lengths, eight, probably saven.' A car length is around 50 feet. 'I was watching ahead to see what it was, and I discovered it was a speeder.' I discovered it was a speeder about five or six car lengths ahead. Immediately, 'I put the brake in the emergency.' I was looking ahead at all times after I rounded the curve until I hit the speeder traveling in the same direction. While I observed him, the man on the speeder 'did not turn at all.'\n Treating the foregoing as a positive statement of observed facts, counsel argue that the headlight must have failed to illumine the track 800 feet ahead; otherwise it is said the engineer would have seen the speeder at that distance and applied the brakes earlier. Also that, if warned by the light when 800 feet away, the decedent would have made visible effort to leave the speeder and thus escape. The presence of conjecture is plain enough. Simply because the engineer failed to see some object 800 feet ahead does not show that he could not have seen so far; his attention might have been directed to points nearer to him or momentarily diverted. How far ahead he was looking does not appear. Nor can it be said that, since the deceased was not seen to change position on the speeder, he received no warning.\n Further, the engineer's statements must be considered in connection with the circumstances attending the accident and other portions of his testimony. The train was \n\n[298 U.S. 99, 104]\n\u00a0\n moving 88 feet per second in the dark and under clouds. In a writing signed 2 days after the accident he affirmed: I 'first saw some object on the track in the glare of the headlight when the engine was 10 to 12 coach lengths away. It may have been a little less than 1,000 feet or could have been a little more. I saw no light on the object and when first seen it appeared to be two dogs running down the track. I pinched up on the brakes making a service application and when the engine was within 6 to 8 coach lengths I could make out for the first time that it was a motor car and a man on it going same way we were. I immediately continued the brake application into emergency, opened the sanders and started sounding a series of short blasts of whistle. I could make out a man on the car with his back to us, his coat collar turned up and looking ahead. I expected every second to see him make some effort to get off the car but so far as I could see he never changed his position until struck.'\n While on the stand (May, 1934), he said that the emergency brakes were applied 'five or six car lengths' from the speeder. 'It might have been more, it might have been less, it might have been a little more.' Also that the 'seven, eight or nine car lengths' was merely a guess. 'It might have been eight, nine, or ten car lengths, it might have been a thousand feet or more, or it might have been a little bit less.' Evidently, his statements were merely guesses; under the circumstances, accurate estimate of distances by him was impossible.\n The 15 year old lad was in his father's yard 600 feet from the track, engaged in the exacting business of catching half-grown chickens in the dark. In substance, he said: 'I heard a train coming.' Next, 'I noticed the train coming down the track.' 'Then I heard the speeder.' By the light of the train, I saw the speeder in front. 'When the train came closer, he whistled.' When he got \n\n[298 U.S. 99, 105]\n\u00a0\n still closer, a rod away, I saw fire from the brakes. When I heard the speeder and heard the train, I looked away from the track towards some cornstalks to see if there was a chicken there. 'When I looked back, then I saw it.' Could not see man on speeder very plain and could not say whether he moved before being hit. Saw train 'about a hundred feet or so' before it struck speeder, headlight beaming, man sitting down on speeder.\n Nothing in all this gives substantial support to the notion that the headlight failed to illuminate the track 800 feet ahead or was below the required standard. Other portions of the evidence stressed for respondent are no more helpful to her position.\n The challenged judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n298 \nU.S. 692\n, 56 S.Ct. 945, 80 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  23.

GILMER(1936)\nNo. 11\nArgued: October 13, 1936Decided: November 9, 1936\n\n\n\n Mr. Minitree J. Fulton, of Richmond, Va., for petitioners.\n * Rehearing denied \n299 \nU.S. 623\n, 57 S.Ct. 229, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n[299 U.S. 99, 100]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George Gilmer, of Charlottesville, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy is one as to the jurisdiction of a United States District Court in Virginia to apply the Virginia practice whereby a notice of motion for judgment is accepted as a substitute for a writ or other process issued from a court.\n Petitioners, shareholders in a national bank, have been charged by the Comptroller of the Currency with an assessment in the amount of the par value of their shares. To enforce that assessment, respondent, the receiver of the bank, gave notice of motion that he would apply for judgment at a given time, incorporating in the notice a statement of the facts making up the claim. There is no question that the practice was in conformity with the statutes of Virginia. The notice, which was signed by the receiver, was served upon the shareholders by the marshal, though it would have been equally efficacious if served by some one else. It did not issue out of the court, did not bear the court seal, and was not signed by the clerk. Upon the return day of the motion the objection was made in behalf of the petitioners that the 'process' was unavailing to bring them into court. The objection was overruled and later, after trial, a judgment on the merits went in favor of the receiver. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the judgment was affirmed. 81 F.(2d) 120. To set at rest a controversy as to an important question of procedure, this Court granted certiorari 'limited to the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court.' \n298 \nU.S. 648\n, 56 S.Ct. 682. \n\n[299 U.S. 99, 101]\n\u00a0\n The remedy by notice of motion in Virginia is governed by section 6046 of the Virginia Code (as amended by Acts Va. 1928, c. 121). 'Any person entitled to maintain an action at law may, in lieu of such action at law, proceed by motion.' The remedy is an ancient one. It goes back to 1732, though at first it was limited to claims for public moneys payable by sheriffs. Acts of May, 1732, c. 10,  8, 4 Va.Stat. (Hening) 352. Gradually it was extended to other situations. As early as 1849 it was made applicable to claims on contract generally. Virginia Code (1849), c. 167,  5. From contracts it spread to torts (Virginia Acts (1912) 15), and to statutory penalties (Id. 651). A revision of the Code in 1919 made the remedy even broader. Virginia Code 1919,  6046. The history of the development has been traced with painstaking precision by students of procedure. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n There is trustworthy evidence that in the practice of the Virginia courts the remedy by motion has almost supersuded the common-law forms of action. \n2\n Even in the federal courts held in the same territory the new procedure has succeeded to a large extent in crowding out the old. An opinion of a federal District Judge (McDowell, J.), announced in 1904, shows the remedy by motion then accepted by the bar. Leas & McVitty v. Merriman (C.C.) 132 F. 510. About thirty years later (January, 1935), the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit with supervisory powers over courts in the same area made a study of the \n\n[299 U.S. 99, 102]\n\u00a0\n intermediate growth. By that time it appeared that the procedure by notice of motion was followed in 95 per cent. of the common-law actions begun in a federal court at Richmond, 33 1\/3 per cent. of those begun at Norfolk, and 14 per cent. of those begun at Alexandria. Eley v. Gamble (C.C.A.) 75 F.(2d) 171, 173.\n Under the Conformity Act [R.S.  914; 28 U.S.C.  724 (28 U.S.C.A.  724], 'The practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in civil causes, other than equity and admiralty causes, in the district courts, shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the State within which such district courts are held, any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding.' How a suit shall be begun, whether by writ or by informal notice, is a question of the practice of the state or of its forms and modes of proceeding. Amy v. Watertown, No. 1, \n130 \nU.S. 301, 304\n, 9 S.Ct. 530. The Constitution of the United States does not attempt to make a choice between one method and another, provided only that the method employed 'gives reasonable notice, and affords fair opportunity to be heard before the issues are decided.' Iowa Central R. Co. v. Iowa, \n160 \nU.S. 389, 393\n, 16 S.Ct. 344, 345. The remedy by notice of motion has had repeated approval by the highest court of Virginia. Virginia Hot Springs Co. v.

It is here sought to be applied, not in equity of admiralty (Coffey v. United States, \n117 \nU.S. 233\n, 6 S.Ct. 717), but in a common-law cause, a quasi contractual obligation being the source of liability (Shriver v. Woodbine Bank, \n285 \nU.S. 467, 477\n, 52 S.Ct. 430, 433; Coffin Brothers & Co. v. Bennett, \n277 \nU.S. 29, 31\n, 48 S.Ct. 422, 423; Bernheimer v.

A fed- \n\n[299 U.S. 99, 103]\n\u00a0\n eral court, adhering to the Conformity Act, must follow the local practice, unless some other act of Congress, creating an exception to the general duty of conformity, has declared a special rule. In re Fisk, \n113 \nU.S. 713\n, 5 S.Ct. 724; Whitford v. Clark County, \n119 \nU.S. 522\n, 7 S.Ct. 306; Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 209\n, 13 S.Ct. 44.\n Petitioners profess to find the necessary exception in section 911 of the Revised Statutes (28 U.S.C.  721 (28 U.S.C.A.  721)), which provides: 'All writs and processes issuing from the courts of the United States shall be under the seal of the court from which they issue, and shall be signed by the clerk thereof. Those issuing from the Supreme Court shall bear teste of the Chief Justice of the United States, or, when that office is vacant, of the associate justice next in precedence, and those issuing from a district court shall bear teste of the judge, or, when that office is vacant, of the clerk thereof.' We do not essay a definition of the word 'process' in every context. It may take on varying shades of meaning in varying surroundings. For present purposes it is enough to say that a notice of motion, if process at all, is not process issuing from a court, and assuredly is not a writ. \n3\n Only writs or processes so issuing are governed by the statute. This is the view expressed more than thirty years ago by Judge McDowell in two cases (Leas & McVitty v. Merriman, supra, and Schofield v. Palmer (C.C.) 134 F. 753), which did much, we may be confident, to guide the conduct of the federal bar in adhering to the Virginia practice. It is the view expressed by Judge (later Mr. Justice) Sanford in the District Court of Tennessee. 'In any proceeding which may properly be instituted and proceeded with upon mere notice to the parties in inter- \n\n[299 U.S. 99, 104]\n\u00a0\n est, without process from the court itself, the requirements of section 911 have no application.' In re Condemnation Suits by United States (D.C.) 234 F. 443, 445. It is the view accepted by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Eley v. Gamble, supra, and again in the case at hand. Cf. Wile v. Cohn (C.C.) 63 F. 759.\n There is instruction also in many state decisions dealing with cognate questions. The Constitution of Virginia prescribes (section 106) that 'writs shall run in the name of the 'Commonwealth of Virginia,' and be attested by the clerks of the several courts.' The Virginia courts have perceived nothing in that mandate at war with the validity of a summary notice of motion signed and issued by the parties. Whitley v. Booker Brick Co., 113 Va. 434, 436, 74 S.E. 160; Kain v. Ashworth, 119 Va. 605, 89 S.E. 857; Mankin v. Aldridge, 127 Va. 761, 767, 105 S.E. 459; Wood v. Kane, 143 Va. 281, 129 S.E. 327. In many other states constitutional or statutory provisions as to the form of writs and other 'process' have received a like construction. People v. Lee, 72 Colo. 598, 213 P. 583; Gilmer v. Bird, 15 Fla. 410; Curry v. Hinman, 11 Ill. 420, 424; McKenna v. Cooper, 79 Kan. 847, 101 P. 662; Herndon v. Wakefield-Moore Realty Co., 143 La. 724, 79 So. 318; Hanna v.

Superior Court, 142 Wash. 270, 253 P. 115, 58 A.L.R. 779; Porter v. Vandercook, 11 Wis. 70. The analogy is apt and the reasoning persuasive.\n Petitioners lean heavily upon early decisions in the District and Circuit Courts for New York wherein the requirements of R.S.  911 were held to be applicable to the New York form of summons. Peaslee v. Haberstro (1879) Fed.Cas.No.10,884, 15 Blatchf. 472; \n\n[299 U.S. 99, 105]\n\u00a0\n Dwight v. Merritt (C.C.1880) 4 F. 614. In so far as these decisions and others following them (United States v. Mitchell (D.C.) 223 F. 805) extend the rule of the statute to notices or forms of process not issuing from a court, they do not have our approval.\n Petitioners suggest that the use of a notice of motion as a substitute for a summons is forbidden by rule 14 adopted by the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The same objection was adequately answered in Eley v. Gamble, supra, 75 F.(2d) 171, at pages 173, 174. If the rule has such a meaning, it is inconsistent with the Conformity Act which governs practice in the District Courts, 'any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n The judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Burks, Pleading and Practice in Actions at Common Law (1st Ed., 1913) 164; Millar, 'Three American Ventures in Summary Civil Procedure' ( 1928) 38 Yale Law Journal, 193; Clark and Samenow, 'The Summary Judgment' ( 1929) 38 Yale Law Journal, 423; 'Report of the College of Law of West Virginia to the Bar Association' (1929) 36 West Virginia Law Quarterly, 5, 70. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] E.

RICKETTS(1936)\nNo. 348\nArgued: February 5, 1936Decided: March 2, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Don W. Stewart, of Lincoln, Neb., and Karl W. Kindleberger, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. R. A. Boehmer, of Lincoln, Neb., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The City of Lincoln, Neb., a municipal corporation, sought priority in the payment of its claim against the Lincoln Trust Company, bankrupt. The claim was for $45,000, with interest. The city based its contention on section 64b of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by Act May 27, 1926,  15, 44 Stat. 666, 11 U.S.C.A.  104(b), and also claimed that the amounts in question had been placed in the custody of the trust company as a trust fund. The District Court held that the city was not within section 64b, and that the trust had not been established except as to the sum of $628. 63. \n * Opinion of Supreme Court conformed to, see 84 F.(2d) 795. \n\n[297 U.S. 373, 374]\n\u00a0\n The court directed that the remainder should be allowed as a general claim. The Circuit Court of Appeals modified the judgment by disallowing altogether the claim of priority, and, as modified, the judgment was affirmed. 77 F.(2d) 425. We granted certiorari, limited to the question of the application of section 64b. \n296 \nU.S. 566\n, 56 S.Ct. 136.\n Section 64b is as follows:\n'The debts to have priority, in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors, and to be paid in full out of bankrupt estates, and the order of payment shall be ... (7) debts owing to any person who by the laws of the States or the United States is entitled to pr ority: Provided, That the term 'person' as used in this section shall include corporations, the United States and the several States and Territories of the United States.' 11 U.S.C.A.  104(b)(7).\n\n The question is presented whether a municipal corporation is a 'person' within the meaning of this section. The word 'person' is expressly stated to include corporations. A municipal corporation is a corporation in the usual sense of the term. Does the Bankruptcy Act use the term in a more limited sense?\n Section 1a(6), as amended by Act May 27, 1926,  1, 44 Stat. 662, 11 U.S.C.A.  1(6), provides that \"corporations' shall mean all bodies having any of the powers and privileges of private corporations not possessed by individuals or partnerships and shall include limited or other partnership associations organized under laws making the capital subscribed alone responsible for the debts of the association, joint stock companies, unincorporated companies and associations, and any business conducted by a trustee, or trustees, wherein beneficial interest or ownership is evidenced by certificate or other written instrument.'\n We find nothing in this definition which can be taken to exclude municipal corporations. The words, 'having any of the powers and privileges of private corporations not possessed by individuals or partnerships,' do not mean, \n\n[297 U.S. 373, 375]\n\u00a0\n as the context plainly shows, that those described must be 'private corporations,' but that the term embraces those which have powers and privileges analogous to those of private corporations and not possessed by individuals or partnerships. Municipal corporations have such powers and privileges and thus fall within the definition of the term 'corporations' as used in the Bankruptcy Act. The range of the definition shows the intention of the Congress to widen rather than to restrict the term.\n Other provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, by expressly excluding municipal corporations in certain relations, indicate that they were intended to be included when, in the absence of exception, the reference is to 'corporations' generally, or to 'persons,' a term which, in the section containing the general definition, is stated to 'include corporations, except where otherwise specified.' Section 1a(19), 11 U.S.C. A.  1(19). Thus section 4, as amended by Act Feb. 11, 1932, 47 Stat. 47 ( see 11 U.S.C.A.  22) provides:\n'(a) Any person, except a municipal, railroad, insurance, banking corporation, or a building and loan association, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Act as a voluntary bankrupt.\n\n'(b) Any natural person, except a wage earner or a person engaged chiefly in farming or the tillage of the soil, any unincorporated company, and any moneyed, business, or commercial corporation (except a municipal, railroad, insurance, or banking corporation, or a building and loan association) owing debts to the amount of $1,000 or over, may be adjudged an involuntary bankrupt upon default or an impartial trial, and shall be subject to the provisions and entitled to the benefits of this Act.'\n\n It is urged that in the provision of section 64a, as amended by Act May 27, 1926,  15, 44 Stat. 666, 11 U.S.C.A.  104(a), specifying the priority of taxes owing by the bankrupt, a 'municipality' is specifically named. The United States and the states are also specifically named in that provision and \n\n[297 U.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n again in section 64b(7). But we think that the failure to repeat the word 'municipality' in section 64b(7) cannot be regarded as controlling in view of the express inclusion of 'corporations' in that subdivision.\n In construing the words of an act of Congress, we seek the legislative intent. We give to the words their natural significance unless that leads to an unreasonable result plainly at variance with the evident purpose of the legislation. Ozawa v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 178, 180\n, 194 S., 43 S.Ct. 65; Ohio v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 360, 370\n, 54 S.Ct. 725. Counsel at the bar could suggest no reason or allowing to corporations generally, or to the associations comprehended within the term 'corporations' as used in the Bankruptcy Act, the priority given by section 64b(7), when the state law provides for it, and denying that priority in accordance with state law to a municipal corporation. We can conceive of no reasonable basis for such a discrimination. And, while we may assume that it would be within the power of the Congress to make it, we find no support in the provisions of the act for the view that such a discrimination was intended.\n Respondent strongly relies upon our decision in Davis v. Pringle, \n268 \nU.S. 315\n, 45 S.Ct. 549. That decision was rendered in 1925, before the amendment of section 64b(7) which defined the term 'person' as there used. From an examination of the context, the Court reached the conclusion that the word 'person' in the original provision was not intended to include the United States. The Court noted that 'Elsewhere in cases of possible doubt when the Act means the United States it says the United States.' Id., \n268 U.S. 315\n, at page 318, 45 S.Ct. 549, 550. The Congress then amended section 64b(7) by expressly providing that the term 'person' should include the United States. Act of May 27, 1926,  15, 44 Stat. 662, 666, 667. But that amendment also provided that the term 'person' should include 'corporations.' At the same time, by the amend- \n\n[297 U.S. 373, 377]\n\u00a0\n ment of section 1a(6), the scope of the term 'corporations' was extended so as to include 'joint stock companies, unincorporated companies and associations.' Id. In view of the explicit inclusion of 'corporations' in the amendment of section 64b(7) and the evident intention shown by the context not to restrict the meaning of the term 'corporations,' the reasoning of the opinion in Davis v. Pringle cannot be regarded as apposite to the present case.\n We conclude that a municipal corporation is a 'corporation' and hence a 'person' entitled to the priority accorded by section 64b(7).\n There is a further question, which is one of state law. The preference under section 64b(7) is only in the case of 'debts owing to any person who by the laws of the States or the United States is entitled to priority.' The further question then is whether the City of Lincoln is entitled to priority under the law of Nebraska. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not determine that question. The court cited its decision as to the status of the City and County of Denver under the laws of Colorado ( City and County of Denver v. Stenger (C.C.A.) 295 F. 809; compare U.S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. McFerson, 78 Colo. 338, 241 P. 728), and apparently assuming, without deciding, that the law of Nebraska accorded priority to the City of Lincoln, the court proceeded to base its decision in the instant case upon the inapplicability of section 64b(7) to a municipal corporation. The law of Nebraska was not discussed.\n As we hold that the construction placed upon the Bankruptcy Act was erroneous, the cause will be returned to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the determination of the remaining issue as to local law.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMONWEALTH TRUST CO.

Barse, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The order granting this certiorari limited our consideration 'to the question of jurisdiction and its appropriate exercise.' \n296 \nU.S. 566\n, 56 S. Ct. 124.\n The facts, not in serious dispute, were fully set out by the Circuit Court of Appeals. It will suffice now to restate those bearing particularly on the points for decision.\n The Trust Department of the Bank of Pittsburgh National Association- the Bank-acquired real estate mortgages and held them in a pool apart from other assets. It sold participation shares therein to sundry customers and issued appropriate certificates. Interest on the mortgages, when collected, was distributed to these as agreed. Difficulties arose; many debtors de- \n\n[297 U.S. 613, 616]\n\u00a0\n faulted; and, to meet the demands of certificate holders, the Bank advanced $40,000.\n In September, 1931, the Bank failed; the Comptroller of the Currency appointed first Thomas, then Atwood, and finally respondent Bradford, as receiver to wind up its affairs. Desiring to relinquish control of the mortgage pool, the receiver consented to the appointment by the orphans' court of petitioner, Commonwealth Trust Company, as successor trustee for the pool assets, and delivered all of them to it. The face value of mortgages so delivered exceeded the total outstanding certificates by $291, 000.\n The orphans' court authorized the trustee to distribute among certificate holders funds collected from mortgage debtors, but nothing went to the receiver of the Bank, 'the Court directing that payme ts to him be suspended pending a judicial determination of' his rights 'to participate in such distribution.'\n Thereupon, the receiver instituted these equity proceedings in the United States District Court. The Commonwealth Trust Company, as trustee, and four certificate holders were made defendants. The prayer of the bill asked an adjudication of the receiver's right to be paid the excess of the mortgage debts over outstanding certificates ($291,000) from assets of the pool; also his privilege to receive therefrom the amount advanced by the Bank ($40,000) on account of agreed interest upon the certificates; and for general relief.\n The District Court granted relief as prayed. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the bill stated a cause in equity within the jurisdiction of the trial court and, with certain modifications, affirmed its decree. As so modified and finally approved, this provides:\n\n 1. \nThat there is due and payable to the plaintiff, Avery J. Bradford, receiver of the Bank of Pittsburgh National Association, out of interest moneys collected and to be collected by the Commonwealth Trust Company \n\n[297 U.S. 613, 617]\n\u00a0\n as trustee of the mortgage pool formerly held by the Bank of Pittsburgh National Association from mortgages in said mortgage pool, the sum of $40, 213.58 advanced to the mortgage pool by the Bank of Pittsburgh National Association.\n\n 2. \nThat the plaintiff, Avery J. Bradford, receiver of the Bank of Pittsburgh National Association, is a participant and cestui que trustent to the amount of $291,020.45 in the mortgage pool formerly administered by the Bank of Pittsburgh National Association and now being administered by the defendant, Commonwealth Trust Company as trustee.\n\n 3. \nThat there is now due and payable from the defendant, Commonwealth Trust Company, trustee as aforesaid, to Avery J.

Weitzel, \n246 \nU.S. 533, 541\n, 38 S.Ct. 381; and that the parties were before the trial court. \n\n[297 U.S. 613, 618]\n\u00a0\n But they maintain the cause stated by the bill was not one cognizable in equity, since the subject-matter was a fund held by a trustee under appointment of the state court against which no adjudication was possible in the absence of an accounting-the necessity of this was inherent in the cause as presented. Also, that to enforce the remedy sought would necessarily interfere with possession and control of the res in the custody of the orphans' court. And further that under the rule of comity approved in Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176\n, 55 S.Ct. 380, 96 A.L.R. 1166, and Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n294 \nU.S. 189\n, 55 S.Ct. 386, the trial court should have dismissed the proceedings.\n The original bill revealed that the receiver had been denied participation as a cestui que trust in the assets held by petitioner trust company, and asked an adjudication f his rights therein. He did not seek direct interference with possession or control of the assets; he prayed that his right to partake thereof be determined. The claim was an equitable one, within the ordinary jurisdiction of the chancellor. 'In all cases in which an action of account would be the proper remedy at law, and in all cases where a trustee is a party, the jurisdiction of a court of equity is undoubted. It is the appropriate tribunal.' Fowle v. Lawrason's Executor, 5 Pet. 495, 503; Clews v. Jamieson, \n182 \nU.S. 461, 479\n, 480 S., 21 S.Ct. 845; Alexander v. Hillman, \n296 \nU.S. 222\n, 56 S.Ct. 204.\n Jurisdiction having been properly invoked, it became the duty of the trial court to determine the issues, unless required by rules based on comity to relegate the complainant to the state court. This may not be done except in special and peculiar circumstances not revealed, we think, by the present record. McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268, 281\n, 30 S.Ct. 501, 504, held: 'It therefore appeared upon the record presented to the circuit court of appeals that the circuit court had \n\n[297 U.S. 613, 619]\n\u00a0\n practically abandoned its jurisdiction over a case of which it had cognizance, and turned the matter over for adjudication to the state court. This it has been steadily held, a Federal court may not do. Chicot County v. Sherwood, \n148 \nU.S. 529, 534\n, 13 S.Ct. 695, 548.' See, also, Kline v. Burke Construction Company, \n260 \nU.S. 226, 234\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 24 A.L.R. 1077\n\n\n The trust here involved was created by the Bank's voluntary action, not by the orphans' court. Whatever control the latter possessed resulted solely from appointment of the successor trustee and, for present purposes did not materially differ from that exercised by probate courts over such fiduciaries as guardians, administrators, executors, etc. The jurisdiction of federal courts to entertain suits against the latter is clear, when instituted in order to determine the validity of claims against the estate or claimants' interests therein. Such proceedings are not in rem; they seek only to establish rights; judgments therein do not deal with the property and other distribution; they adjudicate questions which precede distribution.

Woodburn, 190ill. 283, 289, 60 N.E. 500.\n The trial court properly exercised the jurisdiction which it acquired. The doctrine approved in Pennsylvania v. Williams, and Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, is not applicable. In each of those cases we found conflict between the federal court and authorities \n\n[297 U.S. 613, 620]\n\u00a0\n of the state concerning liquidation of the business and assets of an insolvent local corporation. The question was whether, under the peculiar circumstances disclosed, the federal court should retain jurisdiction; its power generally to render judgment in personam against fiduciaries appointed by state courts was expressly recognized. Here there are no extraordinary circumstances. As contemplated by Congress the receiver sought an adjudication of his rights. The final decree produced no interference with the trustee's possession, nor with the power of the orphans' court to order distribution of assets. The receiver's privilege to participate has been declared; only a judgment in personam was rendered.\n Congress has empowered receivers of national banks to sue in federal courts; the obvious importance of permitting them freely to do so cannot be disregarded.\n All necessary parties were brought before the trial court. The claim to the contrary is without merit.\n The challenged decree is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMPAGNIE GENERALE TRANSATLANTIQUE v. ELTING(1936)\n\nArgued: October 14, 1935Decided: May 18, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Roger O'Donnell, and William J. Peters, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioners. \n\n[298 U.S. 217, 218]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Angus D. MacLean, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 217, 220]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases are much alike. Each involves the validity of a fine imposed on the owner of a foreign ship for an asserted failure to detain on board certain alien seamen after their examination. In both the owner seeks to recover money deposited with the collector of customs of cover the fine, if and when imposed. The deposit was made to obtain clearance of the vessel pending the administrative proceedings which resulted in the fine. A trial by jury resulted in a directed verdict and judgment for the collector, which the Circuit Court of Appeals \n\n[298 U.S. 217, 221]\n\u00a0\n affirmed. 74 F.(2d) 209. The cases are here on certiorari, which was granted because of an apparent divergence in Court of Appeals decisions.\n The material facts, taken largely from controlling allegations and admissions in the pleadings and in part from undisputed evidence, are as follows:\n In No. 6 the Ile de France, owned by a foreign corporation, arrived at the port of New York from a foreign port February 6, 1930, with two aliens in her crew. Under th supervision of the immigation officer in charge, an inspector boarded the ship, examined the crew, and directed the master to detain the two aliens on the ground that they were not shown to be bona fide seamen. The master endeavored to detain them, but they escaped during the night following the direction given to the master. The direction was in writing and addressed 'To the Owner, Agent, Consignee, Master or Officer in Charge of the Ile de France,' but was neither served on the owner nor brought to its knowledge prior to the escape. The master reported the escape and the immigration officer then served on the New York agent of the ship a notice to the effect that a fine was about to be imposed for the failure to detain; that a hearing would be allowed if desired; and that the ship would be granted clearance for her outward- bound voyage upon condition that there be deposited with the collector of customs the sum of $2,000 to cover the fine, should one be imposed. The owner made the deposit under protest, and through counsel requested and participated in a hearing; after which the administrative officers imposed on the owner a fine of $1,000 in respect to each of the alien seamen not detained.\n In No. 7 the owner was another foreign corporation. The direction to detain related to but one alien seaman, was delivered to the chief officer of the ship, and was then brought to the knowledge of the master, but not to \n\n[298 U.S. 217, 222]\n\u00a0\n the knowledge of the owner. The master took steps to detain, but the alien seaman escaped. The amount of the deposit, as also the fine, was $1,000. In all other material respects the facts are like those in No. 6.\n The statute under which the fines were imposed is section 20(a) of the Immigration Act of 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 164, 8 U.S.C.  167(a), 8 U. S.C.A.  167(a) which provides: 'The owner, charterer, agent, consignee, or master of any vessel arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof who fails to detain on board any alien seaman employed on such vessel until the immigration officer in charge at the port of arrival has inspected such seaman (which inspection in all cases shall include a personal physical examination by the medical examiners), or who fails to detain such seaman on board after such inspection or to deport such seaman if required by such immigration officer or the Secretary of Labor to do so, shall pay to the collector of customs of the customs district in which the port of arrival is located the sum of $1,000 for each alien seaman in respect of whom such failure occurs. No vessel shall be granted clearance pending the determination of the liability to the payment of such fine, or while the fine remains unpaid, except that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit of a sum sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof approved by the collector of customs.'\n The purpose of the section is to prevent aliens from unlawfully gaining entrance into the United States under the guise of seamen, and to this end it makes provision for detention on board, both temporary and continued, and for imposing fines on those who, when under a duty to detain, fail to do so. It relates to all vessels arriving within from without the United States with alien seamen employed thereon. Such vessels may be either do- \n\n[298 U.S. 217, 223]\n\u00a0\n mestic or foreign, may be owned by individuals or corporations, may be engaged in transportation for hire or otherwise, and may be, as the section plainly contemplates, in the immediate control of the owner or of a charterer, agent, consignee or master.\n The fine is laid, not on the owner generally, but on the 'owner, charterer, agent, consignee or master of any vessel ... who fails to detain' until an examination is made, or 'who fails to detain' after examination 'if required' by the immigration officer 'to do so.'\n Our present concern is with a fine for failing to detain after examination. A duty so to detain d es not arise unless and until such detention is required by the immigration officer. Obviously, the requirement must be communicated to the one on whom the duty is to rest; otherwise he could not be regarded as 'required' so to detain or as 'failing' to do so. This is conceded in the brief for the collector, where it is said: 'The statute employs the word 'required' in respect of the continued detention. Of course, this means that in some manner the order of detention must be brought home to the party sought to be charged.'\n Here the requirement was communicated to the master of the ship but was not in any way brought to the knowledge of the owner; and yet the administrative officers imposed the fine on the latter. The court below sustained this administrative action on the theory that the master of a ship represents the owner, and therefore notice given to the master may and should be imputed to the owner. But in our opinion the section does not admit of the application of that theory. It contains nothing indicative of a purpose to regard notice to one of the enumerated persons as binding the others or any of them. On the contrary, it deals with all in the same way, includes each of them in the enumeration by reason of his relation to the vessel and his authority over her, \n\n[298 U.S. 217, 224]\n\u00a0\n and puts each on a plane of individual duty and liability regardless of any relation of one to another.\n We conclude, therefore, that so much of the section as is pertinent here is intended to have effect as follows: A master in charge who is required by the immigration officer to detain alien seamen after examination becomes thereby personally charged with a duty to detain them, and, if he fails therein, becomes personally subject to the prescribed fine. The same thing is true of the owner, charterer, agent, or consignee. But none is charged with a duty so to detain unless he is notified of that requirement, and notice to one does not without more operate as notice to another.\n Earlier decisions in the Circuit Court of Appeals, while dealing with facts somewhat different from those now presented, gave to the section a construction similar to that which we give to it. In United States v. J. H. Winchester & Co., 40 F.(2d) 472, there was an effort to subject the agent of a foreign ship to a fine for a failure to detain after inspection. Notice to detain had been served on the master, but not brought to the knowledge of the agent. Counsel for the government urged that, as the ship was foreign, notice to the master bound all, including the agent. But the court held that the section makes no distinction between foreign and domestic vessels; that to be effective the notice to detain must be brought home to the party sought to be charged; and that notice to the master does not suffice to charge the agent. United States v. Columbus Marine Corporation, 62 F.(2d) 795, involved another effort to collect a fine from a ship's agent. A detention order addressed to all who are enumerated in the statute had been served on the master but not on the agent. The court followed the decision in the Winchester Case, ruled that as the order was served only on the master, it did not impose any duty on the agent, and therefore that he was not liable for the failure to detain. \n\n[298 U.S. 217, 225]\n\u00a0\n Lancashire Shipping Co. v. Elting, 70 F.(2d) 699, 701,1 presented still another effort to fine a ship's agent where the order to detain had been communicated to the master only. The court held that the agent, being without notice of the order, was not required to detain; and in rejecting a contention that the notice to the master bound the agent the court said: 'The master was not the representative of the agent and in accepting service of the detention order, he may not be assumed to have acted for it ( the agent). The master is a party under the statute made liable for his violation. He must be regarded as acting in his individual capacity in taking the order.'\n While the admiralty law regards the master of a ship as the agent of the owner,2 the section before us takes no account of that relation, but deals with the master just as it does with the owner. If either is notified to detain, he must comply or be subject to a fine. Nothing in the section indicates that notice to the master and a failure by him are to be imputed to the owner and made a basis for fining the latter.\n We conclude that the direction of verdicts for the collector was error, and that the judgments should be reversed and the cases remanded to the District Court for a new trial.\n Judgments reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Certiorari denied \n293 \nU.S. 594\n, 55 S.Ct. 109. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The agency is not general but special, as is explained in General Interest Insurance Co. v.

McCreary, both of Macon, Ga., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Alexander Holtzoff, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n About June 30, 1933, petitioner filed a claim with the Administration of Veterans' Affairs for allowance of an annuity under the provisions of section 8(a) of the Civil Service Retirement Act of June 16, 1933, 48 Stat. 283, 305, 5 U.S.C.A.  692d (now 5 U.S.C.A.  736a), which authorizes payment of annuities, at a specified rate, under circumstances not now material, to retired government employees in the classified civil service who have rendered at least thirty years' service. His claim was rejected by the director of insurance, on the ground that his employment as a field deputy United States marshal from December 16, 1895 to April 30, 1902, which he had counted as a part of his thirty years' service, could not be so included, because field deputy marshals during that time were employees of the marshal appointing them, and not of the United States. Deducting this period, his total service was twenty-four years, which, if established in accordance with the provisions of the act, would entitle him to an annuity at a lower rate, under section 7 of the Act of May 29, 1930, 46 Stat. 468, 474, 5 U.S.C.A.  697a (now 5 U.S.C.A.  733, 735, 736). On appeal the Board of Veterans' Appeals denied petitioner's application for the same reason.\n In the present suit, brought in the District Court under the Tucker Act, to recover accrued installments of the annuity based on the thirty- year period of service, and \n\n[297 U.S. 167, 169]\n\u00a0\n for a declaratory judgment establishing petitioner's right to such annuity, the court gave judgment for petitioner. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, 76 F.(2d) 715, holding that the District Court was without jurisdiction because the Retirement Act must be construed as committing the adjudication of claims under it solely to administrative officers, to the exclusion of the courts. This Court granted certiorari, \n296 \nU.S. 554\n, 56 S.Ct. 111, in view of the public importance of the questions involved.\n\n\n (1)\n The government urges that the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The Tucker Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 505, as amended by section 24(20) of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1087, 1093, c. 231, 28 U.S.C.  41(20), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), permitting suits against the United States, confers on the District Courts jurisdiction 'concurrent with the Court of Claims, of all claims not exceeding $10,000 founded upon ... any law of Congress, or upon any regulation of an executive department, or upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government of the United States.'\n Section 8(a) of t e Retirement Act declares that, under conditions specified, the employee 'shall be entitled to an annuity ... payable from the civil service retirement and disability fund.' The provision is mandatory, expressed in terms of the right of the employee, which is inseparable from the correlative obligation of the employer, the United States. The present suit to recover the annuity is thus upon a claim 'founded upon a law of Congress' and is within the jurisdiction conferred upon District Courts, as are suits to recover sums of money which administrative officers are directed by Act of Congress to 'pay' or 'repay.' Medbury v. United States, \n173 \nU.S. 492\n, 19 S.Ct. 503; McLean v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 374\n, 33 S.Ct. 122; United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 \nU.S. 1\n, 35 S.Ct. 459, Ann.Cas.1916A, 286, and see United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n166 \nU.S. 468\n, 17 S.Ct. 619. The declaration that the annuities are payable from the re- \n\n[297 U.S. 167, 170]\n\u00a0\n tirement fund, which, by section 8 of the Act of May 22, 1920, 41 Stat. 618, as amended, 5 U.S.C.A.  719, is 'appropriated for the payment of annuities,' amounts to no more than a direction that they shall be charged on the books of the Treasury to the appropriation made for their payment. It does not impair or restrict the obligation to pay.\n The Tucker Act declares that it shall not be construed as giving jurisdiction of 'claims for pensions' or 'of cases brought to recover fees, salary, or compensation for official services of officers of the United States.' The government argues that the present suit must be either the one or the other. It does not press the contention that the annuities are 'salary or compensation,' which we think without merit, see Retirement Board v. McGovern, 316 Pa. 161, 174 A. 400, but it insists that the suit is brought to recover a pension. The proviso withholding jurisdiction of suits on claims for pensions was a part of the original Tucker Act, which became law March 3, 1887, long before the enactment of the Retirement Act of May 22, 1920, and at a time when the term 'pensions' commonly referred to the gratuities paid by the government in recognition of past services in the Army or Navy. The annuities payable under the Retirement Act are not gratuities in that sense. The annuitant contributes to them by deductions from his salary or by actual payments into the fund, as in the present case, and the scheme of the act is to provide for payment of annuities, in part at least from contributions by employees, in recognition both of their past services and of services to be performed.\n The act itself, in contradistinction to the numerous pension acts, see 38 U.S.C., 38 U.S.C.A., does not refer to the annuities as pensions, and expressly excludes from the service to be counted, in determining the class to which the annuitant is to be assigned, the period for which the employee 'elects to receive a pension under any law.' Section 3, Act of May 22, 1920, 41 Stat. 615, as amended, 5 U.S.C.A. \n\n[297 U.S. 167, 171]\n\u00a0\n s 707. We conclude that annuities payable under the Retirement Act are not pensions within the meaning of the Tucker Act and that suits against the government to recover them are within the jurisdiction of District Courts, if not precluded, as the court below held they are, by the administrative provisions of the Retirement Act.\n\n\n (2)\n Although the Retirement Act does not, in terms, forbid employees to assert in the courts rights acquired under it, the government insists that such restriction is to be implied from the administrative provisions of the act. It points to the authority given the Commissioner of Pensions, 1 under direction of the Secretary of the Interior, to make rules and regulations for carrying the act into effect, section 17 of the Act May 29, 1930, 46 Stat. 478, 5 U.S.C.A.  707a (now 5 U.S.C.A.  709), and to section 13 of the same act, 5 U.S.C.A.  703a (now 5 U.S.C.A.  716-718, 725), which prescribes the form of application for the annuity, th character of evidence to be presented in its support, and declares that 'upon receipt of satisfactory evidence the Commissioner of Pensions1 shall forthwith adjudicate the claim of the applicant,' and finally to the administrative appeals authorized by section 17. From this it is argued that the prescribed application to the Commissioner, his adjudication, and the appeal from his decision to departmental officials, afford an exclusive remedy which precludes any resort to the courts for the recovery of the annuity.\n The United States is not, by the creation of claims against itself, bound to provide a remedy in the courts. \n\n[297 U.S. 167, 172]\n\u00a0\n It may withhold all remedy or it may provide an administrative remedy and make it exclusive, however mistaken its exercise. See United States v. Babcock, \n250 \nU.S. 328\n, 39 S.Ct. 464. But, in the absence of compelling language, resort to the courts to assert a right which the statute creates will be deemed to be curtailed only so far as authority to decide is given to the administrative officer. If the statutory benefit is to be allowed only in his discretion, the courts will not substitute their discretion for his. Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551\n, 48 S.Ct. 587; United States v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 451, 454\n, 39 S.Ct. 325; United States ex rel. Ness v.

Elting, \n287 \nU.S. 329, 330\n, 331 S., 53 S.Ct. 167. But the power of the administrative officer will not, in the absence of a plain command, be deemed to extend to the denial of a right which the statute creates, and to which the claimant, upon facts found or admitted by the administrative officer, is entitled.

Payne, \n194 \nU.S. 106, 109\n, 110 S., 24 S. Ct. 595.\n The Commissioner is required by section 13, 'upon receipt of satisfactory evidence' of the character specified 'to adjudicate the claim.' This does not authorize denial of \n\n[297 U.S. 167, 173]\n\u00a0\n a claim if the undisputed facts establish its validity as a matter of law, or preclude the courts from ascertaining whether the conceded facts do so establish it. The decisions of the Director of Insurance and the Board of Veterans' Appeals, and the stipulation of facts upon which the case was tried, show that the petitioner's claim for an annuit based on thirty years' service was rejected on the sole ground that his employment as a field deputy United States marshal could not be counted as service as an employee of the United States. The administrative decision thus turned upon a question of law, whether a field deputy marshal during the period from December 16, 1895, to December 30, 1902, was an employee of the United States. The administrative determination of that question is open to review in the present suit, and should have been considered and decided by the court below.\n\n\n (3)\n We are of the opinion that a field deputy United States marshal from 1895 to 1902 was not an employee of the United States within the meaning of the Retirement Act. Before the Act of May 28, 1896, c. 252, 29 Stat. 140, 181, United States marshals were authorized to appoint deputy marshals, removable from office by the district judge or by the circuit court, R.S.  780 (see 28 U.S.C.A.  493), who were to be paid a 'proper' allowance not to exceed three-fourths of the fees earned by them.

Sections 9 and 10 of the act of 1896 placed the marshal and office deputy marshals upon a salary basis, but section 11 authorized the marshal to appoint field deputy marshals to hold office during his pleasure unless sooner removed by the District Courts, who should receive as compensation three-fourths of the fees, including mileage, earned by them. The status of a field deputy marshal under this legislation was therefore the same as that of all deputy marshals under the earlier act. We regard the question whether such a field deputy marshal was an \n\n[297 U.S. 167, 174]\n\u00a0\n employee of the government or of the marshal as settled by the decision and reasoning of this Court in Douglas v. Wallace, \n161 \nU.S. 346\n, 16 S.Ct. 485, which held that, in view of the manner of a deputy marshal's appointment and payment, his claim for compensation had the status of that of a claim of an employee of the marshal, not of the government, and so was not affected by R.S.,  3477 (31 U.S.C.A.  203), declaring void any assignment of any interest in a claim against the United States. To the same effect are United States v. McDonald (C.C.A.) 72 F. 898, 900; Powell v. United States (C.C.) 60 F. 687; Wintermute v. Smith, 30 Fed.Cas. page 373, No. 17,897. This has been the administrative ruling since 1920, see Claim of George Taylor Larkin, recorded in 21 P.&R. D. 42. A construction of such long standing is not lightly to be overturned. See United States v. Moore, \n95 U.S. 760\n, 763; Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n, 34 S.Ct. 685; Maynard v. Elliott, \n283 \nU.S. 273\n, 51 S.Ct. 390; Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 336\n, 50 S.Ct. 115; Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 375\n, 51 S.Ct. 144; Interstate Commerce Commission v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., \n287 \nU.S. 178\n, 53 S.Ct. 106; Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294, 315\n, 53 S.Ct. 350. Later legislation providing for payment of annuities to employees of the United States must be taken to have been adopted in the light of it.\n Since the record does not disclose any administrative determination of petitioner's right to an annuity computed on the basis of twenty-four years' service, the sole issue now presented is whether the decision that he was not entitled to the annuity calculated on the basis of thirty years' service was erroneous. The judgment of the court below must therefore be affirmed, but for reasons stated in this opinion and not those stated in the opinion of the court below.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] By Executive Order dated July 21, 1930, under section 1 of Act of July 3, 1930, 46 Stat. 1016, the functions of the Bureau of Pensions were transferred to the Veterans' Administration.

Harold L. Ickes, as Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works, was permitted to intervene. He filed an answer showing an agreement dated December 8, 1934 (after the commencement of the suit), between the Government and Greenwood County for the making of a loan by the Government to aid the county in financing its project upon stated terms and conditions. By amended and supplemental bill, plaintiffs challenged the constitutional authority of the Federal Government to make the loan. Defendants' motion to dismiss for want of equity was denied. (D.C.) 10 F.Supp. 854. Defendants answered, evidence was taken and a final decree was entered permanently enjoining defendants from carrying out the contract of December 8, 1934, and the defendant Ickes from advancing to the county, and the county from receiving, any federal funds in furtherance of the project. (D.C.) 12 F.Supp. 70. Defendants appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Appellant Ickes informed the appellate court that, since the taking of the appeal, the contract of December 8, 1934, had been terminated, and a new agreement substi- \n\n[299 U.S. 259, 262]\n\u00a0\n tuted, and that the terms and conditions of the earlier contract, which had been held by the District Court to be in excess of the authority of the county, had been eliminated. Mr. Ickes asked that the cause be remanded to the District Court, with leave to the parties to amend their pleadings in accordance with the facts 'and for a trial or other disposition of the cause on such amended pleadings.' The Circuit Court of Appeals heard argument upon that motion and made the following order:\n'The above entitled cause coming on to be heard on the motion of Harold L. Ickes, Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works, one of the appellants, that the said cause be remanded to the District Court for the Western District of South Carolina to the end that that court may reconsider its decision in the light of the contract entered into between the United States and the County of Greenwood, South Carolina, dated November 30, 1935:\n\n'It is ordered that said cause be remanded to the said District Court to the end that that court may reconsider its decision in the light of the said contract and may take such further action as may be appropriate in the premises.\n\n'The court below is requested to hear the cause thus remanded with all convenient dispatch and to certify his findings of fact and conclusions of law to this court as soon as possible, to the end that the cause may be heard by this court upon appeal on the first Monday in January 1936 in accordance with the agreement of counsel this day made in open court to the effect that they would press for a speedy hearing of the cause and docket the appeal from the decision of the court below for hearing on the date aforesaid without reference to the rules regulating appeals, filing and printing of briefs, etc.'\n\n The order was ambiguous. While without a vacatur of the final decree the District Court could not reconsider the cause and determine it anew, the Circuit Court of Appeals \n\n[299 U.S. 259, 263]\n\u00a0\n did not in terms vacate the decree. In consequence the order was not understood either by the parties or by the District Court, and the subsequent proceedings were extraordinary. The pleadings were not amended. The District Court was in doubt as to the extent to which testimony should be taken. Counsel for defendant Ickes took the position that they should not be limited to proof of the new contract, but should be permitted to have 'a rehearing of the issues raised by the pleadings in this case filed prior to the entry of the final decree in so far as those issues concern the power policy of the Administrator.' They added that there was not time 'to file supplemental pleadings, as would be done were this case to proceed in the usual course.' Plaintiffs' counsel insisted that as the term at which the original decree was entered had expired, there could be no rehearing and accordingly objected to the reception of evidence. They further objected to any evidence not relating to new matter which had arisen since the original decree. The District Court stated that it would take all the evidence offered, but subject to plaintiffs' objections, reserving its ruling as to admissibility. Evidence was then taken. Mr. Ickes was examined and cross-examined. Plaintiffs moved to strike out statements made by him relating to matters not arising since the decree. At plaintiffs' instance, a press release of the Public Works Administration was placed in the record as a part of the cross-examination. A letter from the Deputy Administrator of the bureau was introduced by plaintiffs subject to defendants' objection. This paper was deemed by the court to be irrelevant 'to any issue presented by the order remanding the case' and was placed in the record to show plaintiffs' offer of proof 'in event that the Court of Appeals should rule that defendants are entitled to a rehearing of the original issues which were passed upon and determined by the final decree heretofore entered in this case.' A book entitled \n\n[299 U.S. 259, 264]\n\u00a0\n 'Back to Work,' published by Mr. Ickes, was offered by defendants and admitted subject to plaintiffs' objections. Greenwood County, and its finance board offered witnesses and resolutions to show the action taken by the county.\n Defendants then moved that the record on appeal be supplemented by adding all the testimony 'offered, heard or excluded by the court,' together with the exhibits. The motion was granted. Defendants further moved that their answers 'be taken as amended and supplemented in accordance with the above mentioned proof and evidence.' That motion was denied. Defendants then moved that the answers of the defendant 'be taken as supplemented and\/or amended by adding thereto the contract of November 30, 1935,' between the United States and Greenwood county. That motion was also denied.\n The court filed its decision entitled 'Report to Circuit Court of Appeals of findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to order of remand.' The court recited the proceedings and in particular adverted to the fact that plaintiffs' counsel prior to the introduction of testimony had stated that the only pleadings and issues before the court were the pleadings and issues 'prior to the entry of the final decree,' that no supplemental pleadings had been filed, and that defendants' counsel had admitted that the issues were those 'formed by the present pleadings, and that under the terms of the order of remand there was not time to file supplemental pleadings.' The court said that it was pursuant to that understanding that the testimony had been heard. After reciting the final motions of the parties and its rulings, the court explained that it had overruled the motion to amend the pleadings because the court thought that it did not come 'within the scope of the order' and that it had no right 'to allow an amendment under the status of this case, and, particularly, that it would be an abuse of discretion \n\n[299 U.S. 259, 265]\n\u00a0\n for the amendment to come now.' Ruling on the testimony, the court held 'that all evidence relating to the formal execution of the new contract, and the contract itself as admitted in evidence, has been properly admitted under the terms of the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals,' but that for the reasons stated 'the oral evidence of Mr. Ickes, and documentary evidence relating to other matters such as rates and purposes and policies of the Administration, are incompetent, and must be excluded from consideration. The only documentary evidence admissible is such as related to the execution of the new contract, and authority therefor.'\n The court then made findings of fact the first of which embraced the statement: 'No motion was made in the trial court after the filing of the final decree and prior to the end of the term when the Court had lost jurisdiction, nor has any since been made before to it reopen the case because of after-discovered evidence, or because of a change of the law, or because of its overlooking any material point of law or fact.' Following its findings of fact as to the new contract, the court presented its views of the 'legal issues,' saying: 'As thorough an investigation of the authorities as has been possible under the circumstances since the order of remand was issued, taken in connection with considerable previous investigation on the issues involved, has convinced me that the law does not permit a reopening of the evidence in this case as to the aims and purposes of the Public Works Administration, nor as to the reasonableness of the rates charged by plaintiffs, as to the adequacy of plaintiffs' service, and other issues about which evidence was taken, and which were fully determined upon that evidence, at the former trial. Furthermore, the promptness required for the rehearing by this Court, and its determination, indicates conclusively to my mind that the Circuit Court of Appeals did not intend by its order that the pleadings should be amended and the evidence reopened to allow the pres- \n\n[299 U.S. 259, 266]\n\u00a0\n entation and consideration of any facts other than the force and effect of the new contract, and to what extent, if any, its provisions might require a reversal or modification of my former determinations.' After citing authorities and referring to the proceedings at the former hearing the court said: 'To permit the excluded testimony of Secretary Ickes would not only reopen the trial of all issues regarding rates, reasonableness of service, and the policies of the Public Works Administration, but would be in contradiction of the Government's own witness, and this after the lapse of several months after he was advised of the general result of the decision and his counsel was advised of all the details of the trial.'\n The District Court then set forth its conclusion of law that the substitution of the new contract did not call for a modification of its former conclusions. The court added that it was his judgment that if the excluded testimony at the last hearing should have been admitted, 'it would be insufficient, as a matter of law, to furnish a basis for any modification of my former conclusions of law'; that 'whatever might be the purposes, policies, and practices of the Public Works Administration in reference to competitors, in financing the instant enterprise the result to the plaintiffs would be the same'; and that the lower rates which the enterprise might be able to charge because of Government aid through its loan and grant 'would effectively establish a 'yardstick' or rate of charge which plaintiffs must inevitably meet, or have their business pro tanto destroyed.'\n The climax of misunderstanding was reached in the court's decree. It recited the application of defendant Ickes 'that the court reconsider' its former decree in the light of the new contract 'and set aside and vacate said decree,' and thereupon adjudged that 'the application to set aside and vacate the d decree for injunction entered and filed herein under date of August 26, 1935, be, and the same is hereby, denied. \n\n[299 U.S. 259, 267]\n\u00a0\n Thus the District Court instead of considering the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals as tantamount to a vacatur of the former decree, and as operating to revest the court with jurisdiction of the entire cause and imposing the duty to permit proper amendment of the pleadings and a retrial and complete determination of the cause, considered its former decree as still effective, deemed the competent evidence on the new hearing to be restricted to a narrow point, and ended the proceeding with a decree simply adjudging that the original decree should not be set aside.\n On a certification of these proceedings, the Circuit Court of Appeals interpreted its order of remand. The court said that it thought that 'in view of the changed situation, the lower court should be revested with jurisdiction of the entire cause with power to enter such decree as might be deemed appropriate.' Ignoring the fact that the District Court had not so regarded the order, that the pleadings had not been amended and the case properly retried, the Circuit Court of Appeals proceeded to pass upon the question of the validity of the Act of Congress (40 U.S.C.A.  401 et seq.) under which the federal loan was to be made, and of the action of the Public Works Administrator reversed the decree appealed from and directed the dismissal of the bill for want of equity. 81 F.(2d) 986. We granted certiorari. \n298 \nU.S. 651\n, 56 S.Ct. 941\n\n\n We thus have a situation in which both courts below have failed to act in accordance with the standards of proper procedure. Where it appears upon appeal that the controversy has become entirely moot, it is the duty of the appellate court to set aside the decree below and to remand the cause with directions to dismiss. See United States v. Hamburg- Amerikanische Packet-Fahrt-Actien Gesellschaft, \n239 \nU.S. 466, 475\n, 478 S., 36 S.Ct. 212; Atherton Mills v. Johnston, \n259 \nU.S. 13, 16\n, 42 S. Ct. 422, 423; Brownlow v. Schwartz, \n261 \nU.S. 216, 218\n, 43 S. Ct. 263, 264; United States v. Anchor Coal Co., \n279 \nU.S. 812\n, 49 S.Ct. 262. If it appears that supervening facts require a retrial in the light of a \n\n[299 U.S. 259, 268]\n\u00a0\n changed situation, the appropriate action of the appellate court is to vacate the decree which has been entered and revest the court below with jurisdiction of the cause to the end that issues may be properly framed and the retrial had. See Gulf, C. & S.F.R. Co. v. Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503, 507\n, 509 S., 32 S.Ct. 542; Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca, \n248 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 22 S., 39 S.Ct. 1, 3 A.L.R. 323; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 289\n, 291 S., 44 S.Ct. 323, 324, 325; Patterson v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 600, 607\n, 55 S.Ct. 575, 578. In this instance, the Circuit Court of Appeals could not leave in effective operation the final decree of the District Court and at the same time revest that court with jurisdiction to retry the cause. The appellate court failed to make its ruling with proper clarity and definiteness. For that reason the District Court failed to understand the essential purport of the order to remand. The District Court did not understand that it was revested with complete jurisdiction and its proceedings were not taken and its decision was not rendered with a consciousness of its power and its duty.\n Delusive interests of haste should not be permitted to obscure substantial requirements of orderly procedure. There is no exigency here which demands that these requirements should not be enforced. The cause was heard in the Circuit Court of Appeals upon a record improperly made up. That the cause may be properly heard and determined, we reverse the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals and remand the cause, with directions that the decrees entered by the District Court be vacated, that the parties be permitted to amend their pleadings in the light of the existing facts, and that the cause be retried upon the issues thus presented.\n We express no opinion on the relevancy or effect of the evidence or otherwise upon the merits.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUPARQUET HUOT & MONEUSE CO. v. EVANS(1936)\nNo. 533\nArgued: January 17, 1936Decided: February 3, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Harold Harper, of New York City, and Mark M. Horblit, of Boston, Mass., for petitioners.\n Mr. Daniel A. Shirk, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether a receivership for the collection of rents and profits in a suit for the foreclosure of a mortgage is an 'equity receivership' within the meaning of section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  207), providing for the reorganization of debtor corporations in involuntary proceedings.\n In 1934 and afterwards, '2168 Broadway Corporation' was the owner of a large hotel in the city of New York, \n\n[297 U.S. 216, 217]\n\u00a0\n and of the fixtures and furniture contained therein. It had no other property. The holder of a mortgage on the hotel began an action of foreclosure and procured the appointment of receivers to collect the rents and profits. Soon after that appointment, three creditors of the corporation, holding claims a little in excess of $1,000, filed a petition in a District Court of the United States for the reorganization of the corporate debtor in accordance with section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, alleging that the value of the assets was largely in excess of the liabilities, but that the debtor was unable to pay its debts as they matured. The District Court dismissed the petition on the ground that submis ion to the receivership in the suit for foreclosure was not an act of bankruptcy and did not relieve the creditors from showing in their petition that such an act had been committed. 11 F.Supp. 404. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed (78 F.(2d) 678), declining to follow a decision in the Circuit Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit which upheld a different conclusion. In re Granada Hotel Corporation, 78 F.(2d) 409, affirming (D.C.) 9 F.Supp. 909. Because of this conflict and because of the importance of removing doubt as to the meaning of the statute, a writ of certiorari was granted by this court.\n Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, which took effect as law on June 7, 1934 (Act of June 7, 1934, 48 Stat. 911, 912,  1; 11 U.S.C.  207, 11 U.S. C.A.  207), provides for two classes of proceedings, voluntary and involuntary. Any corporation, with exceptions not now important, may file a petition stating that it is insolvent or presently unable to meet maturing obligations, and that it desires to effect a plan of reorganization. If the petition is approved, the court assuming jurisdiction shall have and may exercise all the powers, unless specially withdrawn, 'which a Federal court would have had it appointed a receiver in equity of the property of the debtor by reason of its inability to pay its debts as they mature.' Section 77B(a), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(a). But juris- \n\n[297 U.S. 216, 218]\n\u00a0\n diction is not confined to proceedings initiated by the debtor. The statute makes provision by the same section for the reorganization of a corporate debtor at the instance of the creditors. Three or more creditors who have provable claims against a corporation aggregating $1,000 or more in excess of the value of securities may file 'a petition stating that such corporation is insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature and, if a prior proceeding in bankruptcy or equity receivership is not pending, that it has committed an act of bankruptcy within four months,' and that such creditors propose that it shall effect a reorganization. Section 77B(a). A later subdivision (section 77B(i); 11 U.S.C.  207(i), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(i) rounds out the statutory scheme. 'If a receiver or trustee of all or any part of the property of a corporation has been appointed by a Federal, State, or Territorial court, ... a petition ... may be filed under this section at any time thereafter by the corporation, or its creditors as provided in subdivision (a) of this section', and upon the approval of the petition by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, 'the trustee or trustees appointed under this section, or the debtor if no trustee is appointed, shall be entitled forthwith to possession' of the property, displacing in so doing the possession of the trustee or receiver theretofore appointed.\n To fix the meaning of these provisions there is need to keep in view the background of their history. There is need to keep in view also the structure of the statute, and the relation, physical and logical, between its several parts. History and structure will be found to teach together that a receivership in a foreclosure suit is not an equity receivership within the meaning of the law.\n The evils and embarrassments that brought section 77B into existence are matters of common knowledge. Corporations not insolvent in the statutory sense (United States v. State of Oklahoma, \n261 \nU.S. 253, 260\n, 261 S., 43 S.Ct. 295), but presently \n\n[297 U.S. 216, 219]\n\u00a0\n unable to discharge maturing obligations, were without a statutory method for winding up their business without a sacrifice of assets. If they had recourse to voluntary bankruptcy, the forms and methods of administration were rigid and often wasteful, leaving little opportunity for cooperative endeavor on the part of all concerned. See Report of Solicitor General Thacher to the President of the United States submitted to the Congress February, 1932; Senate Document 65, 72d Congress, 1st Session, p. 90. If they held aloof from courts and put their trust in time and effort, the e was the danger of disruptive judgments, which would give a preference to a few, with involuntary bankruptcy little, if at all, deferred. The 'equity receivership' flourished in this soil. At the suit of friendly creditors, embarrassed corporations joined in the prayer for the appointment of receivers to stave off other creditors more selfish or impatient, and foster whatever value was latent in the assets. There is little doubt that many of these receiverships were legitimate and helpful. None the less there resided in the practice a capacity for abuses, which will be found reflected in the decisions of this and other courts. At times the receivership was used as an instrument of fraud or covin. Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 \nU.S. 36\n, 48 S.Ct. 268; Shapiro v. Wilgus, \n287 \nU.S. 348\n, 53 S.Ct. 142, 85 A.L.R. 128; cf. First National Bank v. Flershem, \n290 \nU.S. 504, 517\n, 518 S., 54 S.Ct. 298, 90 A. L.R. 391. At times, however fair in its beginnings, it was inordinately prolonged. Michigan, by Haggerty, v. Michigan Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 334\n, 52 S.Ct. 512. At times it had a tendency to entrench delinquency in power, and to stifle inquiry into acts of waste or spoliation. Whatever the importance of these abuses or the defects of the existing remedies, the demand became insistent for a practice more open, more responsible, more efficiently and closely regulated, and withal more surely valid, under the supervision of a court of bankruptcy.\n Section 77B, enacted in 1934, was born of that demand. The remedy to be supplanted or more efficiently con- \n\n[297 U.S. 216, 220]\n\u00a0\n trolled had no relation to receiverships for the collection of rents and profits in actions of foreclosure. The remedy in view was the one generally known as an 'equity receivership,' whereby the assets of a corporation were committed to the custody of a court until the time should arrive when they could be returned to the rehabilitated debtor, or if that should be impossible, divided among creditors. The receivership might come into being at the instance of a stockholder (cf. Bryan v. Welch (C.C.A.) 74 F.(2d) 964), or oftener a creditor, but always the end to be served was essentially the same. The end was reorganization or liquidation or something akin thereto. Cf. Continental Illinois Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & P. Ry., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 672\n, 55 S.Ct. 595; Gordon v. Washington, \n295 \nU.S. 30, 38\n, 55 S.Ct. 584. Neither the members of the legal profession nor the legislators were in danger of confusing decrees directed to such an end with the sequestration of rents in an action of foreclosure. Bar associations had their special committees on 'equity receiverships,' with elaborate reports which were submitted to Congressional Committees. \n1\n Witnesses, appearing in support of one statute or another, discoursed to Congressional Committees on the failings of 'equity receiverships,' and on the measures needed for correction. \n2\n However colloquial and uncertain the words had been in the beginning, they had won for themselves finally an acceptance and a definiteness that made them fit to play a part in the legislative process. They came into the statute through an amendment proposed when the bill which was adopted as section 77B was passing through \n\n[297 U.S. 216, 221]\n\u00a0\n the Senate. Congressional Record, vol. 78, part 7, 73d Congress, 2d Session, p. 7889. They came there freighted with the meaning imparted to them by the mischief to be remedied and by contemporaneous discussion. Humphrey's Executor v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 602, 625\n, 55 S.Ct. 869. In such conditions history is a teacher that is not to be ignored.\n Passing from the setting of the statute to a view of its internal structure, we are brought to the same conclusion, but with added firmness of conviction. A receivership in a foreclosure suit is limited and special. The rents and profits are impounded for the benefit of a particular mortgagee, to be applied upon the debt in the event of a deficiency. Freedman's Saving & Trust Co. v. Shepherd, \n127 \nU.S. 494\n, 8 S.Ct. 1250; Worthen Co. ex rel. Board of Com'rs of Street Imp. Dist. No. 513 v. Kavanaugh, \n295 \nU.S. 56, 62\n, 55 S.Ct. 555, 97 A.L.R. 905; Sullivan v. Rosson, 223 N.Y. 217, 119 N.E. 405, 4 A.L.R. 1400. The corporation retains its other property, if it has any, unaffected in its power of disposition by the decree of sequestration. The creditors retain their remedies except against the income subjected to the lien. There is neither winding up of the business nor attempt to reorganize it and set it going anew. This is not the equity receivership of which the lawmakers were thinking if context and analogy have capacity to deliver up a lesson.\n In our scrutiny of the context, we turn to the beginning of the section with its statement of the powers to be exercised after the approval by the court of a voluntary petition. The powers are to be those 'which a Federal court would have had it appointed a receiver in equity of the property of the debtor by reason of its inability to pay its debts as they mature.' Section 77B(a). But plainly there is no description here of the powers incidental to the appointment of a receiver in foreclosure. On the contrary, the words describe with aptness an equity receivership to wind up or reorganize. We cannot doubt that the same concept persisted through the section. A \n\n[297 U.S. 216, 222]\n\u00a0\n few sentences thereafter, in the selfsame subdivision, Congress used the words in controversy, speaking compendiously of an 'equity receivership' as of something ascertained and known. Surely it was not thinking of a different kind of equity receivership from that explained already, about a score of lines before. The words had been defined. In reason there could be no need to expand or redefine them.\n Still scrutinizing the context, we pass to a later subdivision ( section 77B(i) and mark its implications. We learn from this that a petition may be approved if a receiver or trustee of all or any part of the property of a corporation has been appointed by any court in the United States and that thereupon the possession of the receiver shall be displaced and superseded. But plainly this direction, though fairly applicable to an equity receiver in the sense already indicated, was never meant to apply to a receiver in foreclosure. It is common learning that an equity receiver in suits to conserve the assets or divide them among creditors must yield to a trustee in bankruptcy. Gross v. Irving Trust Co., \n289 \nU.S. 342\n, 53 S.Ct. 605, 90 A.L.R. 1215. On the other hand, it is also common learning that not even a trustee in bankruptcy may override a valid mortgage lien or supersede a receiver who has been put into possession in fulfilment of the mortgage contract. Straton v. New, \n283 \nU.S. 318, 322\n, 327 S., 51 S.Ct. 465; Metcalf v. Barker, \n187 \nU.S. 165\n, 23 S.Ct. 67; Lincoln Savings Bank v. Realty Associates Security Corporation (C.C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 895; In re Berdick (D.C .) 56 F.(2d) 288; Russell v. Edmondson (C.C.A.) 50 F.(2d) 175; In re Brose ( C.C.A.) 254 F. 664; Carling v. Seymour Lumber Co. (C.C.A.) 113 F. 483, 491. Section 77B does not make these precedents inapposite. True, the suit for the foreclosure of the mortgage may be stayed or enjoined upon a showing of necessity (section 77B(c) (10), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(c)(10); the lien may be transferred to the proceeds of a sale (section 77B(b), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(b); at times the holder of the lien may have his security modified or reduced by the \n\n[297 U.S. 216, 223]\n\u00a0\n plan of reorganization when finally approved (section 77B(b), (e), (f), (h ), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(b, e, f, h). Cf. Continental Illinois Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & P. Ry., supra, \n294 U.S. 648\n, pages 675, 676, 677, 55 S.Ct. 595; Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555, 585\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 97 A.L.R. 1106. Nowhere does the statute say, however, that those results or any of them shall follow automatically upon the approval of the petition as properly filed. Section 77B(a). Only by excluding a receiver in foreclosure from the scope of subdivision (i) can we avoid anomalous encroachments upon vested rights and interests.\n Such a reading of the act will help at the same time in the avoidance of other consequences too harsh or incongruous to have been intended by the Congress. The statute speaks (section 77B(i) of a receiver 'of all or any part of the property of a corporation.' These words will have a proper office if the receivership is understood to be a general one for liquidation or for cognate purposes. They will take care of a situation where only part of the property is within the jurisdiction, so that not even an 'equity receivership' will be competent always, without ancillary orders, to give possession of the whole. But the situation is very different if the receivership in view is one for the foreclosure of a mortgage. In its normal operation such a receivership does not connote possession of all the property of the debtor or even all the property within the appointing jurisdiction. The mortgage may be a lien upon one parcel or a few, leaving other property of abundant value for payment of the debts. Indeed, the cases must be many where the owner of a mortgaged building, not personally liable for the payment of the mortgage debt, will hold it the part of prudence, whether he is solvent or insolvent, to let the building go. True indeed it is that in this case it so happens that the property subject to the mortgage is everything the debtor has. All that is but an accident, which has little, if any, bearing upon the meaning of the act. True it is also that a court \n\n[297 U.S. 216, 224]\n\u00a0\n receiving a petition for reorganization in invitum may approve or disapprove it, and that any hardship growing out of extreme or unusual situations may thereby be averted. Even so, the search at the moment is for a definition of an equity receivership that will tend to minimize anomalies, and give consistency and coherence to the statutory rule. There is little persuasion in an argument that in despite of all anomalies the system, if it is well administered, may manage to survive.\n The suggestion is faintly made that under section 3 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.  21, 11 U.S.C.A.  21) the respondent corporation has committed an act of bankruptcy, and hence may be declared a debtor irrespective of the meaning of an 'equity receivership' in section 77B. An act of bankruptcy results inter alia if a 'person,' natural or corporate, has made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if 'while insolvent, a receiver or a trustee has been appointed, or put in charge of his property.' Bankruptcy Act,  3(a)(5), 44 Stat. 662, 663; 11 U.S.C.  21(a)(5), 11 U.S.C.A.  21(a)(5). There is support for the view that to satisfy this provision the receivership must be general, as contrasted with a receivership incidental to the enforcement of a lien. Standard Accident Insurance Co. v. E. T. Sheftall & Co. (C.C.A.) 53 F.(2d) 40, 41. We need not go into that question now. Enough for present purposes that the receiver was not appointed or put in charge 'while' the debtor was 'insolvent.' By the petitioners' admission the value of the assets far exceeds the liabilities. In re Edward Ellsworth Co. (D.C.) 173 F. 699; In re William S. Butler & Co. (C.C.A.) 207 F. 705; Meek v. Beezer (C.C.A.) 28 F.(2d) 343; Standard Accident Insurance Co. v. E. T.

OF NORTH AMERICA(1936)\nNo. 767\nArgued: Decided: May 18, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 448, 449]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. Watson Smith and Leon E. Hickman, both of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioners.\n Messrs. A. L. O'Shea and William B. Greeley, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the court.\n The subject of this controversy is the measure of petitioners' liability for damages and profits under a decree for an accounting by infringers of a patent.\n Respondent, complainant below, is the owner of a patent, No. 1,182, 739, for the making of laminated glass, which will crack, but not shat er. The product is better known as 'safety' or 'shatterproof' glass, and is \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 450]\n\u00a0\n used very largely in the making of automobiles. In the process of manufacture, a sheet of pyralin or celluloid is sandwiched between two thin sheets of plate glass, each one-eighth of an inch thick, the pyralin being cemented to the opposite glass sheets by a film of gelatin. The heat and pressure necessary to induce adhesion are applied to the 'sandwiches' in a receptacle known as an autoclave, a steel boiler of large size. At the end of the process, the glass and the pyralin are firmly joined together with the appearance of a single sheet. For users of motorcars the risk of injury from flying glass is greatly reduced, if not removed altogether.\n Complainant had a decree against the Duplate Corporation, one of the petitioners here, for an infringement of this patent. (D.C.) 42 F.(2d) 737 ; (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 739. Later a supplemental decree was entered against the other petitioner, Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, the owner of 50 per cent. of the stock of Duplate. Puttsburgh was a contributory infringer, supplying Duplate, its subsidiary, with the glass, which was then wrought into the finished product. An accounting followed before a master. The defendants satisfied the master that they were not conscious or deliberate infringers. The finding by the master in that regard was approved by the District Court and later by the Court of Appeals. It will be accepted as a datum here. The account is to be stated on the assumption that the defendants, though infringers, have acted in good faith. Cf. R.S.  4919, 4921; 35 U.S.C.  67, 70, 35 U.S.C.A.  67, 70; L. P. Larson, Jr., Co. v. Wm. Wrigley, Jr., Co., \n277 \nU.S. 97\n, 48 S.Ct. 449.\n The controversy as to the measure of liability divides itself into two branches, one concerned with the defendants' profits, the other with the complainant's damages. In reckoning the profits, the master made allowance to the defendants for the cost of labor and material wasted without fault in the manufacturing process. This \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 451]\n\u00a0\n amounted to $1,192,264.32 ($435,207.52 for loss of glass; $219,036.93 for loss of pyralin; $538,019.87 for loss of labor and material other than glass or pyralin). The master made allowance also for the cost of labor and material that entered into merchandise returned by the defendants' customers for defects afterwards discovered. This amounted to $504,137.45. He refused to make allowance for more than the manufacturing cost of the material bought by one defendant from the other, but did allow the saving effected by the use of patented devices. He found himself unable to ascertain the specific costs of operation to be attributed to sales that had been made at known prices, and refused in stating the account to compare specific prices with average costs of operation, and fix the liability accordingly. Instead, he treated the business as one continuous infringement, a unitary transaction, comparing average costs with average prices. Through this method of computation he arrived at the conclusion that during the period covered by the accounting the defendants had operated at a net loss of $276,857.47 in the sale of the infringing product. That being so, there was nothing owing on the score of profits.\n'In patent nomenclature what the infringer makes is 'profits,' what the owner of the patent loses by such infringement is 'damages.\" Diamond Stone-Sawing Machine Co. v. Brown (C.C.A.) 166 F. 306. The master found the evidence insufficient to show the extent of the sales that the complaint could have made if the defendants had not infringed, or what the sales would have netted even if they had been made. He did find, however, that the effect of the infringement had been to drive the complainant out of business, and that a few sales which had been made were at greatly reduced prices, with a loss of $2,807.89 as a result of the enforced reduction. The diverted sales, if any, nad their value being not susceptible of proof, the master held that general damages should be \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 452]\n\u00a0\n awarded on the basis of a reasonable royalty to be paid by the defendants upon their sales of the infringing product, whether gainful or the opposite. Cf. McKee Glass Co. v. H. C. Fry Glass Co. (C.C.A.) 248 F. 125, 129. This royalty was ascertained to be $414,120.70. Nothing was said by the master as to an award of interest.\n\n The District Court modified the report by striking out the item of damages by reason of price reductions ($2,807.89) and confirmed it as thus modified, adding, however, interest on $414,120.70, the award of general damages from the date of the last infringement (May 31, 1930). 10 F.Supp. 420. There were cross-appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On the appeal by the defendants, the decree was affirmed. On the appeal by the complainant there were far-reaching modifications. All allowances for factory losses and for customer's returns were rejected. These amounted altogether to $1,696,401.77. There was also a rejection of the savings effected by the use of patents. They had been fixed by the master at $1,108,692.73. The method of stating the account was recast by directing a comparison between average costs and specific prices instead of average costs and average prices. The cause was remanded with instructions to restate the account in conformity with the principles laid down in the opinion. 81 F.(2d) 352. To settle important questions as to the liability of infringers, writs of certiorari were granted by this court. \n297 \nU.S. 702\n, 56 S.Ct. 668.\n\n 1. \nFactory losses incurred as a necessary or normal incident to the completion of sales effected at a gain.\n A sale resulting in a loss may not be offset by an infringer against another and independent sale resulting in a gain for the purpose of extinguishing or reducing a liability for profits. Crosby Steam Gage & Valve Co. v. Consolidated Safety Valve Co., \n141 \nU.S. 441, 457\n, 12 S.Ct. 49. On the other hand, the extent of the gain resulting from a sale is not susceptible of ascer- \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 453]\n\u00a0\n tainment without the deduction and allowance of the incidental costs. MacBeth Evans Glass Co. v. L. E. Smith Glass Co. (D.C.) 21 F.(2d) 553, 555; Canda Bros. v. Michigan Malleable Iron Co. (C.C.A.) 152 F. 178, 180; Levin Bros. v. Davis Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.) 72 F.(2d) 163, 165, 166; Stromberg Motor Devices Co. v. Detroit Trust Co. (C.C.A.) 44 F.(2d) 958, 963, 964. To make the product of a factory ready for the market labor and material must be consumed by the seller-manufacturer. The cost of such consumption does not cease to be a charge against the proceeds because viewed in isolation it may be classified as waste. If the waste is unavoidable or even fairly to be expected in the normal course of such a business, there is a diminution of the profit for an infringer as for others. Cf. Providence Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 788, 804. 'Losses occurring concurrently with the gaining of profits should be taken into account, if they resulted from the particular transaction on which the profits are allowed.' MacBeth Evans Glass Co. v. L. E. Smith Glass Co., supra; Canda Bros. v. Michigan Malleable Iron Co., supra. They are the charges that must be known before profits can be estimated.\n Adherence to that principle sustains the ruling of the master that in measuring the gain from particular transactions the defendants should have allowance for the expense of incidental wastage, unless the wastage is so great as to overpass the bounds of reason. Cf. Continuous Glass Press Co. v. Schmertz Wire Glass Co. (C.C.A.) 219 F. 199, 203. No such excess may be imputed to the manufacturing defendant, as is evident from the testimony and the findings of the master. The causes of waste are many. Inevitably a certain amount of glass is lost in the cutting. Grit and dust clinging to the pyralin even in minute particles produce defects destructive of the product as a merchantable commodity. A like result will follow from the intrusion of a hair. To make the situation worse, a sheet of pyralin is charged with static electricity, which \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 454]\n\u00a0\n acts as an attractive force to bring loose particles together. There is also chipping of the glass as well as other damage in the course of transportation from one department to another. Even more destructive is the damage to the sheets under pressure in the autoclave, the crimping of the edges opening a channel into which water tends to seep. Most of this wastage is unavoidable, though extraordinary precautions have been taken to overcome it. To some extent, however, the loss has been diminished by improved methods of manufacture, unknown to the business in its infancy, but progressively developed as the outcome of experience. Thus, to purify the atmosphere and dispel dust or other particles, a separate room has been built, supplied with filtered air. Experiments carefully made have been followed by improvements that reduce the risk of damage when the sheets are under pressure. At all times the business has been conducted with a high degree of care. Even when glass has been chipped or broken in being moved from place to place, there is no evidence that appropriate precautions were omitted to make the loss as small as possible. Some percentage of breakage is a normal, indeed a necessary incident to the handling by human instruments of so fragile a commodity. The situation is tersely summarized in the findings of the master. 'The Master is satisfied from the evidence that a considerable amount of the finished product had to be turned out only to be rejected or returned in order that a certain volume of perfect specimens might be sold. It was also established by the evidence that even the Ford Motor Company, in making laminated glass under its agreement with the plaintiff, was required to produce five million windshields in order to obtain four million good ones-and it appears as self-evident to the Master that in the case of Ford, as in the case at bar, the cost of producing the good ones necessarily included the cost of producing the million had ones, but for which the good ones could not have been produced.' \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 455]\n\u00a0\n In the light of these findings and others to the same effect, the distinction becomes evident between the situation in this case and that in the case of the Crosby valves. Crosby Steam Gage & Valve Co. v. Consolidated Safety Valve Co., \n141 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 457 S., 12 S.Ct. 49. Metal valves had been manufactured as the result of a process of experiment (Id., \n141 U.S. 441\n, at page 454, 12 S.Ct. 49), and had been destroyed when returned or when found to be defective. 'The defendants were not charged on valves which were subsequently destroyed, or, if so, they were not charged upon the new valves which replaced them.' Id., \n141 U.S. 441\n, at page 457, 12 S.Ct. 49, 54. They asked, however, for something more. They contended that the valves so destroyed 'ought to form a credit against the profits actually realized ... on other valves.' This contention was rejected. The valves discarded or returned were experimental only, as the opinion of the court informs us. Id., \n141 U.S. 441\n, at page 454, 12 S.Ct. 49. Cf. Union Electric Welding Co. v. Curry (C.C.A.) 279 F. 465, 467; Page Machine Co. v. Dow, Jones & Co. (D.C.) 238 F. 369, 374. The record does not indicate that the defects were necessary or normal incidents to producing the infringing article. Credit will be allowed for the cost of abortive effort when cost has been incurred as an unavoidable or reasonable preliminary to the particular transaction on which profits are recovered. MacBeth Evans Glass Co. v. L. E. Smith Glass Co., supra. Credit will be refused when this nexus is not established. We have no thought to impugn the correctness of the decision in the case of the defective valves either as applied to its own facts or in cognate situations. We are unwilling to extend it to the costs in controversy here.\n The ruling of the master as to the i ems here considered is accordingly approved.\n\n 2. \nThe allowance of the cost of glass sold by Duplate to its customers, and returned by the customers for defects afterwards discovered.\n These sales were mere futilities. They did not yield a profit for which the sellers have been charged. They \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 456]\n\u00a0\n were not preliminary to other sales refilling the same orders. At least there is nothing in the record to imprint that quality upon them. They have no place in the account at all. By the ruling of the master the cost of these futilities was allowed to the infringers. This we think was error. The infringers being relieved of any charge by reason of such transactions are not entitled to a credit. The case of the Crosby Steam Gage & Valve Co. v. Consolidated Safety Valve Co., \n141 \nU.S. 441, 457\n, 12 S.Ct. 49, gives the applicable rule. The very equities that exact the allowance of a credit where costs are but a means to realizing a profit, exact a different conclusion where profit is impossible.\n\n 3. \nThe measure of the allowance for glass fabricated by one infringer and furnished to the other.\n Duplate bought its glass in sheets one-eighth of an inch thick from its contributory infringer, Pittsburgh. In the computation of the profits, allowance has been made for the material so furnished on the basis of manufacturing cost. The defendants now insist that the basis should be market value. The acceptance of such a measure would enable the infringers to profit by their wrong. There was no use in the automobile industry for glass so thin as this except in connection with the process described in the complainant's patent. Cf., Cuplate Corporation v. Triplex Safety Glass Co. (C.C.A.) 42 F. (2d) 739, 741. If there had been no infringing business, the large amount of glass that went into the infringing product would never have been sold at all. True, glass of that thickness was used in other industries, in train windows and toilet mirrors. The master finds, however, that Pittsburgh had been able, while supplying glass to Duplate, to respond to all demands that came from other users, the railroads and the glaziers. If as part of this accounting it is given credit for the glass at a price above the cost, it will thereby have enlarged its market to an equivalent extent and reaped a profit as infringer. Equity forbids that this result should be attained. We \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 457]\n\u00a0\n are referred by the defendants to Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. Standard Asphalt & Rubber Co. (C.C.A.) 30 F.(2d) 281, 284, as well as other cases. They were well decided on their facts, or so we now assume. The facts do not suggest the inference that the effect of the infringement was to open up a market that would otherwise have been lost.\n\n 4. \nThe allowance of the saving effected by the use of patented devices.\n Pittsburgh was the owner of twenty-six patents which it used for its own benefit in the making of its glass. The claim is made that if the glass is not to be taken on the basis of market value, there must at least be an allowance of a reasonable royalty as compensation for the economies effected through the patented devices. But this is to misconceive utterly the position of an infringer accounting for illicit profits. 'An infringer cannot be heard to say that his superior skill or intelligence enabled him to realize profits by his infringement which a person of less skill might not have realized.' Lawther v. Hamilton (C.C.) 64 F. 221, 224. Cf. Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Wagner Electric & Mfg. Co., \n225 \nU.S. 604, 614\n, 32 S.Ct. 691, 41 L.R.A. (N.S.) 653; Carborundum Co. v. Electric Smelting & Aluminum Co. (C.C.A.) 203 F. 976, 982; Conroy v. Penn Electrical & Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.) 199 F. 427, 430; Armstrong v. Belding Bros. & Co. (C.C.A.) 297 F. 728, 732. He will be heard with no more patience in an endeavor to diminish liability by ascribing his profits to the capacity indwelling in a patent. Whatever is at his call in the service of the enterprise-brawn and intelligence, f ctories and lands, patents and machinery-will be viewed upon an accounting as if held upon a quasi trust to contribute what it can to the profits of the business. The wrongdoer must yield the gains begotten of his wrong.\n\n 5. \nThe method to be employed in stating an account.\n Sales of the infringing product were not made at a level price. At times the price was high; at others it was low. \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 458]\n\u00a0\n The owner of the patent, in holding the infringers to an accounting, is not confined to all or nothing. There may be an acceptance of transactions resulting in a gain with a rejection of transactions resulting in a loss. Upon a statement of an account, a patentee is not looked upon as a 'quasi- partner of the infringers,' under a duty to contribute to the cost of the infringing business as a whole. McKee Glass Co. v. H. C. Fry Glass Co. (C. C.A.) 248 F. 125, 128. He is the victim of a tort, free at his own election to adopt what will help and discard what will harm. Crosby Steam Gage & Valve Co. v. Consolidated Safety Valve Co., supra; Permutit Co. v. Refinite Co. (C.C.A.) 27 F.(2d) 695, 698; Starr Piano Co. v. Auto Pneumatic Action Co. (C.C.A.) 12 F.(2d) 586, 589; Canda Bros. v. Michigan Malleable Iron Co., supra; cf. Oliver v. Piatt, 3 How. 333, 401; Buffum v. Peter Barceloux Co., \n289 \nU.S. 227, 236\n, 53 S.Ct. 539; King v. Talbot, 40 N.Y. 76, 91.\n The privilege of election is not contested by the defendants if costs as well as prices can be ascertained with precision. They take the ground, however, that if such precision is unattainable, the privilege must fail. But the master has found, and the parties are agreed, that in a business of this order there is no method of accounting, not impracticably burdensome, whereby the costs of operation can be apportioned and distributed except upon an average basis. At all events, if such a method was available, the defendants did not use it. They kept their books upon the basis of the method they decry, and measured loss or gain accordingly. Average cost, even if not identical with actual cost, is the best approximation known to accountants. Cf. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. State of North Carolina, \n297 \nU.S. 682\n, 56 S.Ct. 625, March 30, 1936. The defendants will not be suffered to charge the complainant with the losses of unprofitable transactions because the gains of the profitable ones cannot be reckoned to a nicety. The wrongdoer bears the burden in cases of confusion. Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Wagner Electric & Mfg. Co., supra, \n225 U.S. 601\n, at pages 618, 620, 32 S.Ct. 691, 41 L.R.A.(N.S.) 653. \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 459]\n\u00a0\n 6. Damages, interest and an inspection of the books.\n The master advised an award of damages measured by a reasonable royalty on the amount of the defendants' sales. R.S.  4921; 35 U.S.C.  70, 35 U.S.C.A.  70. This was done on the assumption that the complainant had been unable to make proof of actual damages by reason of diverted sales, and that the defendants were not accountable for profits for the reason that the business had been conducted at a loss. Much of the discussion of this subject in the briefs and at the bar may be discovered to be moot when the account has been restated in accordance with the principles laid down in this opinion.\n If, however, an award of damages upon the basis of a reasonable royalty becomes appropriate again, we think that interest should run from the date when the damages are liquidated, and not, as by the present decree, from the date of the last infringement. Crosby Steam Gage & Valve Co. v. Consolidated Safety Valve Co., supra, \n141 U.S. 441\n, at pages 457, 458, 12 S.Ct. 49; Tilghman v. Proctor, \n125 \nU.S. 136, 160\n, 161 S., 8 S.Ct. 894; Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 653. There are no exceptional circumstances justifying a departure from what is at least the general rule.\n A word is needed in conclusion as to the asserted right of the defendants to examine the complainant's book . The defendants insist that with the aid of an inspection they can show that actual damages were suffered by reason of diverted sales, and damages so substantial as to forbid the award of a reasonable royalty, a substituted method of assessment to be used if other standards fail. It is not easy to see how the diversion of business, a negative condition, will be made apparent by the books. As we interpret the record, the defendants did not so contend when they asked for an inspection at the hearing before the master. Their position then was that 'the damage to the plaintiff arising out of its alleged loss of sales was inconsiderable in amount.' If, however, it shall appear upon the restatement of the account that in \n\n[298 U.S. 448, 460]\n\u00a0\n the belief of the defendants, reasonably entertained, an inspection of the books is still material and necessary, the propriety of such a remedy may be reconsidered by the master and the court in the light of the entire situation developed at that time.\n The decree should be modified in accordance with this opinion, and as modified affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nESSEX RAZOR BLADE CORP. v. GILLETTE SAFETY RAZOR CO.(1936)\nNo. 21\nArgued: Decided: November 9, 1936\n\n\n\n Mr. Geo. E. Middleton, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Henry R. Ashton and Charles Neave, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent makes and sells safety razors and blades. The petitioner makes and sells only blades. The \n\n[299 U.S. 94, 95]\n\u00a0\n Gaisman patent, No. 1,633,739, owned by the respondent, covers both safety razor blades and razors, and for the alleged infringement by petitioner of claims 1 and 2 covering blades this suit was brought. The claims are so nearly alike that quotation of claim 1 will suffice: 'A blade having a non- circular opening substantially centrally disposed to retain the blade in shaving relation to a guard member, said blade having means spaced from said opening to cooperate with a clamping member to retain the latter in shaving relation to the blade independent of the guard member.'\n The novelty claimed for the patented article is that the blade acts as a positioning device or key to maintain in cap, the blade itself, and the guard, in proper relation to each other for shaving.\n The District Court dismissed the bill on the ground that the patent was void for want of invention. \n1\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the patent disclosed invention and was infringed by the petitioner's blade. 2 The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has decided that a blade like the petitioner's in all important features does not infringe. \n3\n In view of the conflict certiorari was granted. \n298 \nU.S. 649\n, 56 S.Ct. 834\n\n\n Safety razors of the Gillette type combine these elements: A guard, a cap or backing member, a blade, a handle, and means to clamp the blade in shaving position between the cap and the guard. King C. Gillette accomplished a major advance in the art when he conceived a double-edged blade so thin and flexible as to require external support to give rigidity to its cutting edge and a safety razor embodying such a blade. In 1904 he was awarded a patent, No. 755,134, for this invention. He \n\n[299 U.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n claimed 'as a new article of manufacture a detachable razor-blade of such thinness and flexibility as to require external support and give rigidity to its cutting edge.' He made further claims of which the following may be taken as typical: 'In a razor, the combination with a perforated blade of a holder comprising a guard, a backing, a handle, and positioning and clamping means passing through the perforations in the blade.'\n His patent, which was sustained with respect to the claims both for the blade and for the razor,4 expired years before the issue of that which is the subject of the present litigation. In Gillette's specifications and drawings the means disclosed for holding the blade in position between the guard and the cap are two metal arms secured to the base of the guard and turned upwards to pass through the guard near each end. The blade and the cap have slots through which these metal arms pass when the razor is assembled. The function of the arms is described thus: 'To position the blade with respect to the guard and hold it against lateral movements.' The patent also discloses that the cap and guard are to be clamped together upon the blade by a threaded post set in the center of the cap passing through a hole in the center of the blade and another in the center of the guard and screwed into the end of the handle. In commercial practice Gillette substituted for the arms affixed to the guard two pins or posts set in the transverse median line of the cap equidistant from the center. He then made his blade and guard with two corresponding holes so that in assembling the razor these posts or pins passed through the blade and the guard and held the blade in position when the handle was \n\n[299 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n screwed upon the center post of the cap to clamp the blade in shaving position. After the granting of the Gillette patent, many others having to do with safety razors of a similar type were issued. These exhibited various means for fixing and holding a blade in position between cap and guard, although invention apparently was not claimed to consist in any such positioning device. In some, a protuberance was placed on the guard to fit into a slot in the blade and pass through that into an appropriate recess in the cap. In others pins were set in the guard to pass through holes in the blade and thence into sockets in the cap. Still others showed the same device as Gillette used commercially. Several showed slots cut in the end of the blade and cap to be engaged by pins or springs extending from the guard. In others, the procedure was reversed, the slots being in the end of the blade and guard to be engaged by pins or lugs set in the ends of the cap. In most of these patents, as in Gillette's combination, the device adopted locked together all three members, guard, blade, and cap. In Gaisman's construction the guard carries a noncircular protuberance and the blade has a hole cut into it to fit snugly over this protuberance. The blade also has notches in its ends or corners and the cap is provided with corresponding pins or lugs to engage these notches. The protuberance on the guard, although passing through and fixing the blade in position with reference to the guard, has no functional connection with the cap. On the other hand, the lugs on the cap which position the blade with respect to it do not engage the guard or have any functional connection with the latter. The advantages claimed for this method are that it renders assembly of the razor easier and also makes possible a more accurate location of the shaving edge of the blade relative to the edges of cap and guard, because, in the \n\n[299 U.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n old pin or post type, greater tolerances had to be allowed with consequent possibility of excessive shifting of the blade in relation to the other two members; or such tolerances had to be overcome in the manufacture of the parts, greatly increasing the cost of production. Thus it is said that, with the same manufacturing routine, the respondent's new so-called Goodwill razor, embodying the Gaisman construction, permits a possible shifting of the blade of not over three one-thousandths of an inch as compared with five one-thousandths of an inch in the old design.\n Though the petitioner's blade closely resembles the Gaisman blade furnished by the respondent for use in its Goodwill razor, we lay to one side the inquiry whether the similitude is such as to constitute infringement, since we hold the patent invalid for lack of invention.\n As already suggested, every safety razor consisting of a combination of guard, cap, blade, and clamping means must also provide means to keep the blade in position relative to the cap and guard. The means adopted have been various. Gillette resorted to the device of square rods or round pins fixed either to the guard or to the cap and slots or holes in the blade and the other member through which the rods or pins should pass to fix the blade in position. Gaisman fixed the blade relative to the guard by one set of lugs and slots and fixed it in relation to the cap by another set of lugs and slots. The choice was one between alternative means obvious to any mechanic; it did not have the quality of invention.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 13 F.Supp. 505. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 83 F.(2d) 541. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Gillette Safety Razor Co. v.

TAX COMMISSION OF STATE OF WASHINGTON(1936)\nNo. 628\nArgued: March 9, 1936Decided: March 30, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 650, 651]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Godfrey Goldmark, of New York City, and Donald G. Graham and R. J. Venables, both of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n Mr. E. P. Donnelly, of Seattle, Wash., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the state of Washington, Judicial Code,  237 (28 U.S.C.A.  344), presents the question whether a state occupation tax, measured by the gross receipts from radio broadcasting from stations within the state, is an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.\n Appellant brought suit to enjoin appellees, the State Tax Commission, from collecting the tax, laid by section 2 of chapter 191, p. 870, of the Washington Laws of 1933, as an infringement of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. On demurrer to the bill of complaint, and on stipulation of the parties that the cause might be decided upon the facts there alleged, the state Supreme Court gave final judgment for the appellees. 182 Wash. 163, 45 P.(2d) 942; Id., 49 P.(2d) 1151\n\n\n Appellant maintains, within the state, two broadcasting stations licensed by the Federal Radio Commission (now the Federal Communications Commission). One is licensed to operate with power and a radio frequency enabling it to broadcast throughout the 'fifth zone,' which comprises eleven western and northwestern states, including Washington, and the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii. The other is licensed to operate as a 'clear channel' station, that is to say, a station to which the Commission has assigned a radio frequency to be used at such times and with such power as will enable it to broadcast throughout the United States without interference by \n\n[297 U.S. 650, 652]\n\u00a0\n other stations. Sections 2, 4, 5, Federal Radio Act of 1927,1 44 Stat. 1162; Regulations, Federal Radio Commission, File No. 5-R-B-63 and Official No. 63; File No. 5-R-B-67 and Official No. 67, Nos. 70-75, No. 111, Nos. 116-124. These stations broadcast over the areas for which they are licensed, and the adjacent high seas and a part of Canada.\n Broadcasting, according to the allegations of the complaint, is accomplished by the generation, at the broadcasting station, of electromagnetic waves, which pass through space to receiving instruments which amplify them and translate them into audible sound waves. The essential elements in the broadcasting operation are a supply of electrical energy, a transmitter, the connecting medium or 'ether' between the transmission and r ceiving instruments, and the receiving mechanism.\n Appellant's entire income consists of payments to it by other broadcasting companies or by advertisers for broadcasting, from its Washington stations, advertising programs originating there or transmitted to them from other states by wire. Appellant 'sells time' to its customers at stipulated rates, during which it broadcasts from its stations such advertising programs as may be agreed upon. During such time as is not sold, it broadcasts, at its own expense, 'sustaining' programs, as required by the regulations of the Federal Radio Commission. The customers desire the broadcasts to reach the listening public in the areas which appellant serves, and a large number of persons, many of them in other states, listen to the broadcasts from appellant's stations.\n The state Supreme Court recognized that state taxation of gross income derived from interstate commerce is forbidden by the commerce clause. But it upheld the tax on the ground that the business from which appel- \n\n[297 U.S. 650, 653]\n\u00a0\n lant receives its income is not interstate commerce. It conceded, as it had previously held, Van Dusen v. Department of Labor and Industries, 158 Wash. 414, 290 P. 803, that broadcasting is commerce, and that the broadcasting by appellant of its own programs for which it does not receive pay is interstate commerce. But it concluded that appellant's remunerative business is not interstate commerce because it consists of furnishing, within the state, the facilities of its stations to customers who use them for broadcasting their programs, and the business of providing such facilities, like that of providing a bridge for the use of others in crossing state lines, is not commerce. See Detroit International Bridge Co. v. Corporation Tax Appeal Board, \n294 \nU.S. 83\n, 55 S.Ct. 332; Henderson Bridge v. Kentucky, \n166 \nU.S. 150\n, 17 S.Ct. 532.\n We may assume, although it is not alleged, that appellant's customers produce the sounds which are broadcasted. But it sufficiently appears, although the complaint does not specifically so state, that appellant, and not the customer, generates the electric current and controls the apparatus (generator, transmitter, and their controls) by which the sounds are broadcasted. The complaint states that appellant operates its stations and conducts the business of broadcasting in the manner already described, and that the license to operate them is granted to appellant by the Federal Radio Commission under the Federal Radio Act. These allegations, read in the light of the statute, which forbids any save licensees to operate broadcasting apparatus, section 1, Federal Radio Act of 1927, 44 Stat. 1162, and of the facts of which we have judicial knowledge, see Buck v. Jewel-LaSalle Realty Co., \n283 \nU.S. 191, 200\n, 51 S.Ct. 410; DeForest Radio Co. v. General Electric Co., \n283 \nU.S. 664, 670\n, 51 S.Ct. 563, et seq., must be taken to state that the broadcasting of radio emanations, as distinguished from the production of the sounds broadcasted, is effected by appellant and not by its customers. \n\n[297 U.S. 650, 654]\n\u00a0\n The sounds broadcasted are not transmitted from the microphone to the ears of listeners in other states. They do not pass as sound waves to the receiving mechanisms. They serve only to enable the broadcaster, by the use of appropriate apparatus, to modulate the radio emanations which he generates. These emanations, as modulated, are projected through space to the receiving sets. There, by a reverse process, they so actuate the receiving mechanisms as to produce a new set of sound waves, of frequencies identical with those produced at the microphone. On the argument it was conceded that, in broadcasting for its customers, appellant, by generating the necessary electric power and controlling the transmitter, produces the radio emanations which actuate the receiving mechanisms located in other states. Upon the facts alleged, we see no more basis for saying that appellant's customers o the broadcasting than for saying that a patron of a railroad or a telephone company alone conducts the commerce involved in his railroad journey or telephone conversation.\n Appellant is thus engaged in the business of transmitting advertising programs from its stations in Washington to those persons in other states who 'listen in' through the use of receiving sets. In all essentials its procedure does not differ from that employed in sending telegraph or telephone messages across state lines, which is interstate commerce. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Speight, \n254 \nU.S. 17\n, 41 S.Ct. 11; New Jersey Bell Tel. Co. v. State Board of Taxes, 280u.S. 338, 50 S. Ct. 111; Cooney v. Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 384\n, 55 S.Ct. 477; Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Washington, \n297 \nU.S. 403\n, 56 S.Ct. 522, 80.Ed. 760, decided March 2, 1936. In each, transmission is effected by means of energy manifestations produced at the point of reception in one state which are generated and controlled at the sending point in another. Whether the transmission is effected by the aid of wires, or through a perhaps less well-understood medium, \n\n[297 U.S. 650, 655]\n\u00a0\n 'the ether,' is immaterial, in the light of those practical considerations which have dictated the conclusion that the transmission of information interstate is a form of 'intercourse,' which is commerce. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189.\n Similarly, we perceive no basis for the distinction urged by appellee, that appellant does not own or control the receiving mechanisms. The communications broadcasted are no less complete and effective, nor any the less effected by appellant, because it does not own or command the apparatus by which they are received. The essential purpose and indispensable effect of all broadcasting is the transmission of intelligence from the broadcasting station to distant listeners. It is that for which the customer pays. By its very nature broadcasting transcends state lines and is national in its scope and importance- characteristics which bring it within the purpose and protection, and subject it to the control, of the commerce clause. See Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Bond & Mortgage Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 279\n, 53 S.Ct. 627.\n It is unnecessary to determine whether, as the court below suggested and appellee argues, like considerations would require us to hold that the exposure of a sign board, in one state, to the view of dwellers in another, is likewise interstate commerce. Whether the practical and scientific aspects of such an operation bring it within the range of those factors which we deem controlling here, may well be left for decision when such a case is presented. See Pantomimic Corporation v. Malone (C.C.A.) 238 F. 135.\n As appellant's income is derived from interstate commerce, the tax, measured by appellant's gross income, is of a type which has long been held to be an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. Philadelphia & So. Mail S.S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118, 30.Ed. 1200; Leloup v. Port of Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640\n, 8 S.Ct. 1380; Galveston, H. & S.A. \n\n[297 U.S. 650, 656]\n\u00a0\n R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217\n, 28 S.Ct. 638; Crew-Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292\n, 38 S.Ct. 126. But appellee further contends, as the state court thought, that, even though broadcasting thought, that, even though broadcasting involves interstate commerce, the maintenance and operation of appellant's stations includes intrastate activities which may be subjected to state taxation, as was the generation of electricity, transmitted to points outside the state, in Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165\n, 52 S.Ct. 548. There the tax was measured by the amount of current generated at the taxpayer's hydroelectric plant, from which electric power was supplied to consumers in other states. This court held that the operation of generating electrical power, although virtually simu taneous with its transmission, is so distinct and separable from the operation of transmission, in interstate commerce, as to be the appropriate subject of a state tax. The argument now made overlooks the fact that the present tax is not levied upon or measured by appellant's generation of electromagnetic waves, but by its gross receipts for the service it performs, which includes both the generation of the energy and its transmission as a means of communication interstate.\n Whether the state could tax the generation of such energy, or other local activity of appellant, as distinguished from the gross income derived from its business, it is unnecessary to decide. See City of Atlanta v. Oglethorpe University, 178 Ga. 379, 173 S.E. 110. It is enough that the present is not such a tax, but is levied on gross receipts from appellant's entire operations, which include interstate commerce. As it does not appear that any of the taxed income is allocable to intrastate commerce, the tax as a whole must fail, Cooney v. Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co., supra; cf. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Washington, supra, and the judgment of the state court must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This Act has been superseded by the Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1081, 47 U.S.C.  301 et seq.

LINES(1936)\nNo. 19\nArgued: October 15, 1936Decided: November 9, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[299 U.S. 77, 78]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Simone N. Gazan, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Arthur M. Boal, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner is the administrator of the estate of Coy E. Foust and, February 1, 1934, commenced an action at law under section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 19201 in \n\n[299 U.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n the United States court for the Southern District of New York against the Munson Steamship Lines. His complaint alleges that, February 27, 1930, while deceased was at work for defendant as seaman on its steamship Mundelta, his death was caused by defendant's negligence and, for the benefit of petitioner as surviving father, prays damages in the sum of $15, 000. Defendant's answer denies the negligence charged against it and alleges decedent's death was caused by risks assumed and his own negligence.\n June 11, 1934, defendant filed its petition for reorganization under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act. \n2\n The petition did not refer to the administrator's claim or to the action brought for its enforcement. Two days after it was filed, the court entered a decree that approved the petition as properly filed, declared the debtor unable to meet its debts as they mature, determined it required relief under section 77B, appointed trustees to take and operate its property and, inter alia, enjoined the institution or prosecution of any action at law against the debtor.\n January 26, 1935, petitioner applied for leave to prosecute his suit and supported his application by an affidavit of his attorney suggesting: The debtor is covered by liability insurance; if petitioner gets judgment, he will sue insurer to enforce its liability under section 109 of the Insurance Law of New York (Consol.Laws, c. 28), as amended by Laws 1924, c. 639;3 the stay is unjust to the sur- \n\n[299 U.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n viving father, gives no advantage to the debtor, and benefits only the insurer. The affidavit asserts that plaintiff is entitled to a jury trial and that prosecution of his action at law should not be stayed. The trustees by affidavit of one of their attorneys opposed petitioner's application but did not say that the debtor is not protected by insurance. The court denied petitioner's motion and ordered that a special master be appointed to report on the claim. Petitioner applied to the Circuit Court of Appeals for leave to appeal. After hearing the parties, it filed an opinion announcing that appeal would be granted but that the argument would be confined to the question whether the action can be stayed. Later the court entered an order unqualifiedly allowing the appeal. Meyer v. Kenmore Granville Hotel Co., \n297 \nU.S. 160, 165\n, 56 S.Ct. 405.\n After argument, limited as suggested, the court in its first opinion on the appeal held petitioner's claim provable and dischargeable and the District Court empowered to stay prosecution of the suit. In re Munson S.S. Lines (C.C.A.) 80 F.(2d) 859. Then there remained for consideration the question-which had not been argued-whether in the exertion of that power the District Court abused its discretion. The court suggested that, if, petitioner would stipulate not to use as a claim against the estate any judgment he might recover, there could be no objection to allowing his action to proceed. It held the appeal should not be finally determined without giving the parties a chance to present their views as to whether the District Court ought not to allow the action to proceed and directed that, if petitioner failed to file such a stipulation within a specified time, supplemental \n\n[299 U.S. 77, 81]\n\u00a0\n briefs would be received relating to the propriety of the exercise of the judicial discretion of the District Court. Petitioner having declined so to stipulate, the parties submitted their briefs. In his, petitioner stated that under the insurance policy the first $2,500 of petitioner's claim would be borne by the insured; that the value of the claim was not over $5,000; and that such stipulation would mean that the administrator would relinquish a substantial part of his claim. Upon consideration of the additional briefs the court in its second opinion on the appeal held that the District Court had not abused discretion, and affirmed the order. In re Munson S. S. Lines (C.C.A.) 82 F.(2d) 289.\n As a reason in support of the stay, the first opinion states that jurors often return far larger verdicts in negligence cases than reason justifies, and that the trustees have a right to take that fact into account had not to accede to a method for the liquidation of tort claims that is unusual in bankruptcy unless the ordinary method of proof before a special master would imperil the claimant's rights. In its second opinion the court adopted and emphasized the fact stated in appellant's supplemental brief to the effect that the policy covered not over one-half the value of petitioner's claim. It decided that, as the debtor's estate had a substantial interest in the amount of the recovery, the District Judge did not abuse his discretion. The court said: 'That mode was more convenient and expeditious than any other and was plainly an advantage to the estate.' It added: 'If the claim had been fully covered by the insurance so that the carrier was primarily liable for the entire damage, we might have reached a different conclusion; but, under the circumstances, we think the determination of the court below was justified,' and affirmed the order appealed from.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly held petitioner's claim provable and dischargeable and the District Judge empowered to stay proceedings in the suit. \n\n[299 U.S. 77, 82]\n\u00a0\n Section 77B gives to the District Judge power, to be exerted in accordance with its provisions, to alter the rights of creditors or any class of them. Subdivision (b)(10),  77B (11 U.S.C.A.  207(b)(10), declares the term 'creditors' shall include, for all the purposes of the section, the holders of claims of whatever character and whether or not they would otherwise constitute provable claims under the Bankruptcy Act; that the term 'claims' includes debts, securities, other than stock, liens, or other interests of whatever character. Subdivision (h), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(h), directs that the final decree shall discharge the debtor from its debts and liabilities. Subdivision (c)(8), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(c)(8), provides that, if a plan is not proposed or accepted or if proposed and accepted but not confirmed, the court may direct the estate to be liquidated. Subdivision (k)(4), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(k)(4), upon order for liquidation, authorizes to be proved as provided in section 57 (11 U.S.C.A .  93) claims provable under section 63,4 but declares that none of the sections mentioned in subdivision (k) except subdivisions (g), (i), (j), and (m) of section 575 and subdivisions a and e of section 706 shall apply in proceedings under section 77B unless and until an order has been made directing liquidation of the estate. Mere reading of pertinent parts of the above-mentioned provisions makes it plain that 'creditors' and 'claims' as used in proceedings under section 77B are more comprehensive than in the act before the addition of that section. See American Surety Co. of New York v. Marotta, \n287 \nU.S. 513, 517\n, 53 S.Ct. 260, 261. Undoubtedly 'creditors,' 'claims' and 'liabilities' to \n\n[299 U.S. 77, 83]\n\u00a0\n be dealt with in the reorganization proceeding include petitioner, the cause of action he asserts and the judgment he seeks to recover.\n Section 77B(c)(10), (11 U.S.C.A.  207(c)(10), enlarging power conferred by section 11,7 broadly declares the judge 'may enjoin or stay the commencement or continuation of suits against the debtor until after final decree.' The exclusive jurisdiction given the court over the debtor and his property, subdivision (a), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(a), does not imply that the commencement or the carrying on of suits against the debtor must be enjoined or that all claims must be referred to a master for consideration and report. Subdivision (c)(11), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(c)(11). See In re Prudence Bonds Corporation (C.C.A.) 75 F.(2d) 262, 263. The power to stay does not imply that it is to be, or appropriately may be, exerted without regard to the facts. The granting or withholding of injunction is left to the discretion of the court.\n Was the denial of petitioner's application for leave to prosecute his action at law an abuse of discretion?\n The record contains no opinion or statement of the District Judge to disclose the grounds on which he rested his denial. In reorganization proceedings neither the act nor any rule of law entitles debtors or trustees as a matter of right to enjoin the trial of actions such as that brought by petitioner. The court is to exercise the power conferred by subdivision (c)(10), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(c)(10), according to the particular circumstances of the case and is to be guided by considerations that under the law make for the ascertainment of what is just to the claimants, the debtor and the estate. Osborn v. U.S. Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, 866; The Styria, Scopinich, Claimant v. Morgan, \n186 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 22 S.Ct. 731; Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 541\n, 51 S.Ct. 243, 247; Burns v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 216, 222\n, 223 S., 53 S.Ct. 154, 156. By section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act (46 U.S.C.A.  688), under which the petitioner sued, Congress ordained that upon claims for personal \n\n[299 U.S. 77, 84]\n\u00a0\n injuries or death suffered in the course of their employment seamen or their personal representatives may maintain actions at law for damages with the right of trial by jury. The reorganization proceedings are not inherently inconsistent with jury trial for the liquidation of such claims. Unless satisfactorily shown that prosecution of petitioner's action would embarrass the administration of the debtor's estate, the District Court should have granted leave.\n There is no support for the stay in the suggestion of the Circuit Court of Appeals to the effect that in negligence cases juries often give verdicts larger than reason justifies. It is to be remembered that if without support in the evidence or contrary to the law they may be set aside. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472, 478\n, 46 S.Ct. 564, 566; Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90\n, 50 S.Ct. 231; Minneapolis, etc., Ry. v. Moquin, \n283 \nU.S. 520, 521\n, 51 S.Ct. 501, 502. It must be assumed that the courts by appropriate exertion of their power will adequately safeguard against verdicts shown to be arbitrary and unjust. While section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act remains in force courts may not assume that claims there specified cannot be justly liquidated by jury trial. Even if shown generally to attend jury trials, the suggested danger would not warrant denial of petitioner's application. We have recently said: 'Maintenance of the jury as a fact- finding body is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.' Dimick v. Schiedt, \n293 \nU.S. 474, 486\n, 55 S.Ct. 296, 301, 95 A.L.R. 1150\n\n\n The record does not sustain the statement that the mode of liquidation ordered is an advantage to the estate. On the contrary, the petitioner's verified application for leave to appeal states that the attorney for debtor in the action at law 'represents the insurance carrier and consequently the defense of this case will impose no burden \n\n[299 U.S. 77, 85]\n\u00a0\n whatsoever, either financial or otherwise, upon the trustees herein or their counsel.' That statement has not been denied; nor has it been suggested by the debtor or trustees that the insurer is not bound under the policy at its own expense to defend the suit.\n Respondent suggests that the record fails to show that the policy was issued in New York and insists that, unless it was, the insurance may not be taken into account in determining whether the District Court abused its discretion. The point is without merit. The affidavit submitted by petitioner states in substance that the debtor is protected by liability insurance and that any judgment recovered by petitioner on his claim will have to be paid by the insurer; that if allowed to establish his claim by jury trial petitioner will then sue insurer under section 109 of the New York Insurance Law for the amount, if any, awarded to him and that the only party benefiting by the delay is the insurance company. It is true that the affidavit does not directly state that the policy is governed by section 109 or that it contains the provisions required by that section, but the affidavit is sufficient adequately to suggest that petitioner claimed that insurer's liability to the debtor is in accordance with the provisions of that section. The debtor and trustees had notice of his application for release from the stay; the trustees appeared to oppose it. They failed to produce the policy or to disclose any of its provisions or whether it was issued in New York.\n The injunction was a comprehensive one plainly broad enough to cover petitioner's claim; it was entered without disclosure of the existence of that claim or the pending suit and before petitioner had opportunity to be heard on the propriety of making it apply to him. On his application for leave to bring his suit to trial petitioner was seeking to remove the stay; and under the circumstances the position of debtor and trustees opposing him \n\n[299 U.S. 77, 86]\n\u00a0\n and insisting that the restraint be continued was not substantially unlike that of suitors for injunction; the issue was whether liquidation of his claim in that manner would unjustly affect the estate. The facts bearing on that question were known to, or within the control of, the debtor and trustees. They had, and readily could submit to the court, definite evidence in respect of the insurance. Their failure to bring it forward tends strongly to discredit their opposition to petitioner's motion. The circumstances warrant the inference that the facts are not more favorable to respondent than those indicated by the affidavit as the grounds on which the petitioner sought release from the stay, and that, if disclosed, the policy or other evidence as to the insurance would not tend to support injunction against petitioner. Runkle v. Burnham, \n153 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 14 S. Ct. 837; Kirby v. Tallmadge, \n160 \nU.S. 379, 383\n, 16 S.Ct. 349; Mammoth Oil Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 13, 52\n, 48 S.Ct. 1, 10. The burden of frank disclosure was upon the debtor and trustees. Keystone Driller Co. v. Excavator Co., \n290 \nU.S. 240, 244\n, 54 S.Ct. 146, 147. Cf. 2 High on Injunctions (4th Ed.)  1474. In the absence of a showing of facts sufficient to require a finding that liquidation of petitioner's claim by jury trial would encumber the reorganization proceedings, the debtor and trustees were not entitled to have the injunction continued in force against petitioner. Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 541\n, 51 S.Ct. 243, 247.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals dealt with the case according to the facts indicated in petitioner's supporting affidavit as modified by the statement taken from his supplemental brief to the effect that the policy did not cover the first $2,500 of the debtor's liability. Petitioner emphasizes the fact that the record does not show the modification and says that his statement as to the amount deductible was made in explanation of his refusal \n\n[299 U.S. 77, 87]\n\u00a0\n to stipulate that he would not file against the estate a claim based on the judgment, if any, obtained in the pending suit. 80 F.(2d) 859, 861. He earnestly insists that the court erred in predicating its decision upon that statement. As in the view we take of the case the fact that debtor is only partially insured is not of controlling significance, we do not pass upon that assignment of error.\n Assuming that the insurance did not extend to the first $2,500 and the value of petitioner's claim was not more than $5,000, we are of opinion that the order appealed from was an abuse of the discretion vested in the District Court by section 77B(c)(10), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(c)(10). If petitioner's claim shall be established upon report of a master, grave doubts will arise as to the liability of the insurer to the petitioner. The case would not be within the words of section 109 of the New York Insurance Law. Attempt by petitioner to recover from insurer would encounter difficult questions of construction of a state statute as to which federal courts are not the final authority. Morehead v. People of State of New York, \n298 \nU.S. 587\n, 56 S.Ct. 918, 103 A.L.R. 1445. The imposition of that method of establishing petitioner's claim is liable to expose him to serious peril of substantial loss. On the other hand, if petitioner is permitted to liquidate his claim by jury trial and shall get judgment, and execution thereon shall be returned unsatisfied because of the debtor's insolvency, his case would appear to be plainly within the words and intent of section 109. That section applying, petitioner would be entitled to maintain an action against the insurer for the amount of his judgment but not exceeding the amount of insurer's liability to the debtor under the policy.\n There is nothing in the record to warrant a finding that liquidation of petitioner's claim by trial of his pending action at law would hinder, burden, delay or be at all inconsistent with the pending corporate reorganization \n\n[299 U.S. 77, 88]\n\u00a0\n proceeding under section 77B (11 U.S.C.A.  207). Injunction against that method of establishing the debtor's liability, if any there is, ought not to stand.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'In case of the death of any seaman as a result of any ... personal injury (suffered in the course of his employment) the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury. ...

CAPITAL CO.(1936)\nNo. 23\nArgued: October 16, 1936Decided: November 9, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[299 U.S. 105, 106]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Benjamin Reass, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. D. Whitney, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether there is jurisdiction in the Circuit Court of Appeals to review upon appeal an order fining a judgment debtor for contempt in refusing to submit to an examination in proceedings supplementary to judgment.\n Respondent had a judgment against petitioner for $297,412.91 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Upon default in payment, the creditor began a proceeding supplementary to the judgment, for the examination of the debtor. By the Civil Practice Act of New York (section 774, as added by Laws 1935, c. 630) such a proceeding may be instituted by order of the Court, by subpoena, or by warrant. Respondent resorted to the second of these methods. The judgment debtor having failed to respond to the subpoena, an application was made to punish him for contempt. The Court made an order adjudging the contempt with leave to the debtor to purge himself thereof. Thereafter, upon evidence that the contempt continued, the court made a second order fining the debtor for his contempt in the amount of $235,082.03, then unpaid upon the judgment, and an additional amount of $10,000 to be paid to the attorneys of the judgment creditors for the costs of the proceeding. A warrant was to issue to the Marshal whereby the debtor was to be confined in jail until payment of the fine, with the proviso, in substance, that except for the costs of the proceeding, $10,000, the fine would be remitted upon submission to \n\n[299 U.S. 105, 107]\n\u00a0\n the subpoena. From the two orders so made the debtor appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where the appeal was dismissed. To settle the practice in a situation likely to recur, this Court granted certiorari, the review to be 'limited to the question of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals.'\n A proceeding for the examination of a debtor as a supplement to judgment or execution is a summary substitute for a suit in equity by a creditor for the discovery of assets. In re Boyd, \n105 U.S. 647\n, 651-653; Leroy v. Rogers, 3 Paige (N.Y.) 234; Hadden v. Spader, 20 Johns. (N.Y.) 554, 565; Scoville v. Shed, 36 Hun (N.Y.) 165, 167. It continues 'until closed or discontinued by consent or discontinued, dismissed or closed by order of the court.' New York Civil Practice Act,  802, subd. 1, as added by Laws 1935, c. 630; Steinman v. Conlon, 208 N.Y. 198, 101 N.E. 863; Hand v. Ortschreib Building Corporation, 254 N.Y. 15, 171 N.E. 889. It 'shall be deemed closed two years from the service of the order, subpoena or warrant' initiating it, unless extended by order for a definite period. Section 802, subd. 1. It may be closed within that time upon a showing by the debtor of unreasonable delay. Section 802, subd. 3. The relief appropriate to the proceeding includes the appointment of a receiver, or a decree for the payment of money or the delivery of property. Steinman v. Conlon, supra, 208 N.Y. 198, at page 202, 101 N.E. 863. The imposition of a fine for the refusal of the debtor to appear or answer is not a substitute for such relief or for adequate discovery. Despite the contempt or the penalties therefor, the proceeding may continue until its aim has been achieved.\n The rule is settled in this Court that except in connection with an appeal from a final judgment or decree, a party to a suit may not review upon appeal an order fining or imprisoning him for the commission of a civil contempt. Doyle v. London Guarantee & Accident Co., Ltd., \n204 \nU.S. 599\n, 27 S.Ct. 313; In re Christensen Engineering Co., 194 U. S. \n\n[299 U.S. 105, 108]\n\u00a0\n 458, 24 S.Ct. 729; Hayes v. Fischer, \n102 U.S. 121\n; Worden v. Searls, \n121 \nU.S. 14, 25\n, 7 S.Ct. 814. The appellant in the court below, the petitioner before us here, was a party to a suit or proceeding for the discovery of assets. There is no occasion to consider how far his rights and remedies would be different if he had been a stranger to the record, a witness or an adverse claimant. Nelson v. United States, \n201 \nU.S. 92, 115\n, 26 S.Ct. 358; Alexander v. United States, \n201 \nU.S. 117, 122\n, 26 S.Ct. 356. Not only was he a party; he was a party to a proceeding then in its initial stages. Discovery was in abeyance, and what the final relief would be was still a subject for conjecture. This sufficiently appears from the statement already made as to the function and duration of a proceeding supplementary to judgment. Finally, the contempt charged and adjudicated was not criminal, but civil; reparation to an obstructed creditor, not vindication of the public justice, was the purpose of the fine, and of the fine in all its parts. Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 441\n, 31 S.Ct. 492, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 874; Doyle v. London Guarantee & Accident Co., supra, \n204 U.S. 599\n, at page 606, 27 S.Ct. 313; Lamb v.

If this could otherwise be doubtful, it is made clear beyond cavil by the recitals of the order.\n Petitioner does not question the compensatory or civil quality of so much of the fine as may be avoided at any time by obeying the subpoena. He takes the ground, however, that the fine of $10,000 which was imposed unconditionally, is in excess of any damage suffered by force of the contempt (cf. 28 U.S.C.  387 (28 U.S.C.A.  387)), and from this he moves to the conclusion that the penalty was inflicted as retribution for a crime. But the conclusion does not follow though the premise be accepted. The court may have erred in its assessment of the costs required for reparation. As to that we do not intimate an opinion either one way or the other. What is very plain is the fact that the assessment was made in a genuine \n\n[299 U.S. 105, 109]\n\u00a0\n endeavor to reimburse a harassed creditor for the damages occasioned by obstruction and delay. Errors, if there were any, did not split the controversy into parts, one civil and one criminal. Cf. Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 40 S.Ct. 347, 349. It retained from first to last its unitary quality. In levying the fine, the court was not acting sua sponte, or at the instance of the government through a prosecuting officer. Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., supra; Lamb v. Cramer, supra; Union Tool Co. v. Wilson, \n259 \nU.S. 107, 112\n, 42 S.Ct. 427, 429; Michaelson v.

It lent a helping hand to a suppliant for aid.\n The order is not final and there is no error in the ruling that it is not subject to appeal.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGEORGIA RAILWAY & ELEC.

Colquitt, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 620, 622]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James A. Branch, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n April 29, 1935 (\n295 \nU.S. 165\n, 55 S.Ct. 701), we reversed the decree pronounced by the Supreme Court of Georgia in this cause, September 18, 1934 (Georgia Power Co. v. City of Decatur, 179 Ga. 471, 176 S.E. 494), and sent it back for further proceedings not inconsistent \n\n[297 U.S. 620, 623]\n\u00a0\n with the accompanying opinion. That opinion discloses the circumstances of the litigation and our reasons for reversal.\n After notice to the parties, the Supreme Court, with felicitous recognition of obligation to do nothing in conflict with the ruling here, again considered the original record. September 30, 1935, after disclaiming any purpose theretofore to construe the pertinent state statutes as unhappily chosen words had led us to conclude, it announced their meaning and once more affirmed the decree of the trial court (Ga.Sup .) 182 S.E. 32. A second appeal gives us jurisdiction.\n Appellants insist, first, that the decree presently challenged is not consistent with our opinion and mandate; and, second, that, if the Georgia statutes be construed and applied as finally ruled by her Supreme Court, they will be deprived of equal protection and due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n As appears from our opinion of April 29, 1935, following long- established doctrine, we accepted the construction of the statutes placed upon them by the Supreme Court and decreed accordingly. Elmendorf v. Taylor, 10 Wheat. 152, 159; Chicago, M., St. P. & P. Railroad Co. v. Risty, \n276 \nU.S. 567, 570\n, 48 S.Ct. 396. So regarded, they empowered the municipality to assess paving costs against the utility only upon the basis of benefits received. And, as appellants had been deprived of opportunity to show the absence of advantage, we held due process of law had been denied.\n After the first decree was reversed and set aside, the cause went back for disposition by the Supreme Court. Our mandate restricted its powers in that regard so far as necessary to prevent conflict with rulings here, but not otherwise. Only federal questions were open for our determination. We accepted the construction placed upon the statutes by the Supreme Court and held that so \n\n[297 U.S. 620, 624]\n\u00a0\n to apply them would deprive appellants of a federal right. We suggested no interpretation of our own, and did not affirmatively indicate the further action to be taken. Schneider Granite Co. v. Gast Realty & Investment Co., \n245 \nU.S. 288, 291\n, 38 S.Ct. 125. The decree now under consideration is not in conflict with anything said or done by us. Appellants' claim to the contrary is not well founded. Without exceeding the limitations prescribed, the Supreme Court reconsidered the cause, put its own construction upon the statutes, and adjudged accordingly.\n In the circumstances disclosed by the record, will appellants be deprived of the equal protection or due process of law if the state statutes, as finally interpreted, are applied to them?\n Upon this point, counsel submit: Under the statutes as construed, other parties would be subject to assessment by the municipality for the cost of paving only upon the basis of benefits; appellants would be liable without regard thereto. Street railways are entitled to the same constitutional protection accorded to others. Also that, if the special assessment was product of the police or taxing power, the utility was entitled to a judicial hearing in respect of its unreasonable or arbitrary exercise.\n Considering our declarations in Durham Public Service Co. v. Durham, \n261 \nU.S. 149\n, 43 S.Ct. 290, 291, that 'There are obvious reasons for imposing peculiar obligations upon a railway in respect of streets occupied by its tracks,' we cannot say the Supreme Court erred in concluding there was no violation of the equal protection clause. Fort Smith Light & Traction Co. v. Board of Improvement of Paving District, \n274 \nU.S. 387\n, 47 S.Ct. 595\n\n\n The power of the municipality to require a street railway to pave streets used by it, without regard to benefits, is clear enough. Durham, etc., Co. v. Durham, supra; Southern Wisconsin Railway Co. v. Madison, \n240 \nU.S. 457, 461\n, 36 S.Ct. 400. The court below recognized the general right \n\n[297 U.S. 620, 625]\n\u00a0\n to demand inquiry concern ng arbitrary exercise of the taxing or police power, when adequately alleged. But it found that appellants had not set up that defense, except as implied in the claim that any assessment not based on benefits was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court, we think, correctly said:\n'There is no question as to the regularity of the assessment under the general law of the state, and the charter of the city as amended, and the ordinances duly enacted thereunder. It has already been determined that the paving was done and that the assessment therefor was made in conformity to the law. Payment therefor is undertaken to be avoided by the power company on the ground that the pavement was of no benefit to the company. It has been held by this court, in construing the law of the state in reference to street paving and cost thereof, that a street railway could not defend against the payment on the ground of no benefit.'\n\n Appellants have failed to show deprivation of any federal right through denial of opportunity to rely upon an adequate defense, properly advanced. We need not, therefore, consider the conclusions of the Supreme Court concerning an estoppel.\n The questioned decree must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOOCH v.

Gen., and Gordon Dean, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By permission of section 346, 28 U.S.C.A., the Circuit Court of Appeals, 10th Circuit, has certified two questions and asked instruction.\n\n 1. \nIs holding an officer to avoid arrest within the meaning of the phrase, 'held for ransom or reward or \n\n[297 U.S. 124, 125]\n\u00a0\n otherwise,' in the act of June 22, 1932, as amended May 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 781), 18 U.S.C.A.  408a?\n\n 2. \nIs it an offense under section 408a, supra, to kidnap and transport a person in interstate commerce for the purpose of preventing the arrest of the kidnaper?\n The statement revealing the facts and circumstances out of which the questions arise follows-\n'Gooch was convicted and sentenced to be hanged under an indictment charging that he, with one Nix, kidnaped two officers at Paris, Texas, 'for the purpose of preventing his (Gooch's) arrest by the said peace officers in the State of Texas', and transported them in interstate commerce from Paris, Texas, to Pushmataha County, Oklahoma, and at the time of the kidnaping did bodily harm and injury to one of the officers from which bodily harm the officer was suffering at the time of his liberation by Gooch and Nix in Oklahoma.\n\n'The proof supports the charge. It established these facts: Gooch and Nix, while heavily armed, were accosted by the officers at Paris, Texas. To avoid arrest, Gooch and Nix resisted and disarmed the officers, unlawfully seized and kidnaped them and transported them by automobile from Texas to Oklahoma, and liberated them in the latter State. During the time Gooch and Nix were kidnaping the officers they inflicted serious bodily injury upon oen of the officers, from which injury he was suffering at the time of such liberation in the State of Oklahoma.'\n\n The Act of June 22, 1932, c. 271, 47 Stat. 326, provided:\n'That whoever shall knowingly transport or cause to be transported, or aid or abet in transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce, any person who shall have been unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, kidnaped, abducted, or carried away by any means whatsoever and held for ransom or reward shall, upon convic- \n\n[297 U.S. 124, 126]\n\u00a0\n tion, be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary for such term of years as the court, in its discretion, shall determine.'\n\n The amending Act of May 18, 1934, c. 301, 48 Stat. 781, 18 U.S.C.A.  408a, declares:\n'Whoever shall knowingly transport or cause to be transported, or aid or abet in transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce, any person who shall have been unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, kidnaped, abducted, or carried away by any means whatsoever and held for ransom or reward or otherwise, except, in the case of a minor, by a parent thereof, shall, upon conviction, be punished (1) by death if the verdict of the jury shall so recommend, provided that the sentence of death shall not be imposed by the court if, prior to its imposition, the kidnaped person has been liberated unharmed, or (2) if the death penalty shall not apply nor be imposed the convicted person shall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary for such term of years as the court in its discretion shall determine.'\n\n Counsel for Gooch submit that the words 'ransom or reward' import 'some pecuniary consideration or payment of something of value'; that as the statute is criminal the familiar rule of ejusdem generis must be strictly applied; and finally, it cannot properly be said that a purpose to prevent arrest and one to obtain money or something of pecuniary value are similar in nature.\n The original act (1932) required that the transported person should be held 'for ransom or reward.' It did not undertake to define the words and nothing indicates an intent to limit their meaning to benefits of pecuniary value. Generally, reward implies something given in return for good or evil done or received.\n Informed by experience during two years, and for reasons satisfactory to itself, Congress undertook by the 1934 act to enlarge the earlier one and to clarify its pur- \n\n[297 U.S. 124, 127]\n\u00a0\n pose by inserting 'or otherwise, except, in the case of a minor, by a parent thereof,' immediately after 'held for ransom or reward.' The history of the enactment emphasized this view.\n The Senate Judiciary Committee made a report, copied in the margin,1 recommending passage of the amending bill and pointing out the broad purpose intended to be accomplished.\n The House Judiciary Committee made a like recommendation and said: \n\n[297 U.S. 124, 128]\n\u00a0\n 'This bill, as amended, proposes three changes in the act known as the 'Federal Kidnaping Act.' First, it is proposed to add the words 'or otherwise, except, in the case of a minor, by a parent thereof.' This will extend Federal jurisdiction under the act to persons who have been kidnaped and held, not only for reward, but for any other reason, except that a kidnaping by a parent of his child is specifically exempted. ... H.Rep.1457, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., May 3, 1934.'\n Evidently, Congress intended to prevent transportation in interstate or foreign commerce of persons who were being unlawfully restrained in order that the captor might secure some benefit to himself. And this is adequately expressed by the words of the enactment.\n The rule of ejusdem generis, while firmly established, is only an instrumentality for ascertaining the correct meaning of words when there is uncertainty. Ordinarily, it limits general terms which follow specific ones to matters similar to those specified; but it may not be used to defeat the obvious purpose of legislation. And, while penal statutes are narrowly construed, this does not require rejection of that sense of the words which best harmonizes with the context and the end in view. United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 395; Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., \n196 U.S. 1\n-17, 18, 25 S.Ct. 158; United States v. Bitty, \n208 \nU.S. 393, 402\n, 28 S.Ct. 396; United States v. Mescall, \n215 U.S. 26\n-31, 32, 30 S.Ct. 19.\n Holding an officer to prevent the captor's arrest is something done with the expectation of benefit to the transgressor. So also is kidnaping with purpose to secure money. These benefits, while not the same, are similar in their general nature and the desire to secure either of them may lead to kidnaping. If the word 'reward,' as commonly understood, is not itself broad enough to include benefits expected to follow the prevention of an arrest, they fall within the broad term, 'otherwise.' \n\n[297 U.S. 124, 129]\n\u00a0\n The words 'except, in the case of a minor, by a parent thereof' emphasize the intended result of the enactment. They indicate legislative understanding that in their absence a parent, who carried his child away because of affection, might subject himself to condemnation of the statute. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 438.\n Both questions must be answered in the affirmative. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The Committee on the Judiciary, having had under consideration the bill (S. 2252) to amend the act forbidding the transportation of kidnaped persons in interstate commerce, reports the same favorably to the Senate and recommends that the bill do pass.\n'The purpose and need of this legislation are set out in the following memorandum from the Department of Justice:\n\n'S. 2252; H.R. 6918: This is a bill to amend the act forbidding the transportation of kidnaped persons in interstate commerce-act of June 22, 1932 (U.S.C., ch. 271, title 18, sec. 408a), commonly known as the 'Lindbergh Act.' This amendment adds thereto the word 'otherwise' so that the act as amended reads: 'Whoever shall knowingly transport ... any person who shall have been unlawfully seized ... and held for ransom or reward or otherwise shall, upon conviction, be punished. ...' The object of the addition of the word 'otherwise' is to extend the jurisdiction of this act to persons who have been kidnaped and held, not only for reward, but for any other reason.\n\n'In addition, this bill adds a proviso to the Lindbergh Act to the effect that in the absence of the return of the person kidnaped and in the absence of the apprehension of the kidnaper during a period of 3 days, the presumption arises that such person has been transported in interstate or foreign commerce, but such presumption is not conclusive.\n\n'I believe that this is a sound amendment which will clear up border- line cases, justifying Federal investigation in most of such cases and assuring the validity of Federal prosecution in numerous instances in which such prosecution would be questionable under the present form of this act.

TEXAS CO.(1936)\nNo. 727\nArgued: Decided: May 18, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Middle District of Alabama.\n Messrs. F. H. Moore and Richard T. Rives, both of Montgomery, Ala., for appellants. \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 394]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John S. Coleman, of Birmingham, Ala., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 393, 395]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee brought this suit against appellants, officers of the state of Alabama, to restrain the collection under statutes of that state of taxes in respect of gasoline and other liquid motor fuels-which for brevity we shall call 'gasoline'-sold to the United States and used by it in performing governmental functions. P aintiff applied to the court of three judges for a temporary and a permanent injunction. After hearing on an agreed statement of facts, the court held that the Alabama statutes assailed are not distinguishable from the Mississippi exaction condemned as unconstitutional in Panhandle Oil Co. v. Knox, \n277 \nU.S. 218\n, 48 S.Ct. 451, 56 A.L.R. 583, and granted a permanent injunction. Texas Co. v. Carmichael (D.C.) 13 F.Supp. 242. The Governor and the other state officers appealed. 28 U.S.C.  345 (28 U.S.C.A.  345). The United States, by brief filed here as amicus curiae, presented its argument asking affirmance on the ground that the taxes impose a burden on sales to it. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In substance the Alabama statutes2 provide: The Act of February 10, 1923 (not here involved) required every distributor and retail dealer to pay an excise tax of two cents per gallon 'upon the sale' of gasoline. A distributor is one who sells gasoline at wholesale. A retail \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 396]\n\u00a0\n dealer is a distributor who also sells gasoline in broken quantities. The Act of January 25, 1927 (Gen.Acts Ala.1927, p. 16), required every distributor, retail dealer 'or storer' to pay 2 cents per gallon 'upon the selling, distributing or withdrawing from storage for any use' ( 2). A storer is one 'who ships gasoline into this State ... and stores the same and withdraws or uses the same for any purpose' ( 1). The Act of August 27, 1927 (Gen.Acts Ala.1927, p. 326), amending that of 1923, employed the same from of words to define the exaction and made a total tax of 4 cents upon selling, distributing, or withdrawing for any use. The Act of July 27, 1931 (Gen.Acts Ala.1931, p. 859), added a cent and that of November 5, 1932 (Gen.Acts Ala.1932, Ex.Sess. p. 314), added another. The Act of January 31, 1935, repealed the 1931 and 1932 statutes, and, in lieu of the excises laid by them, imposed one of 2 cents. The Act of July 10, 1935 (Gen.Acts Ala.1935, p. 509,  348, Schedule 156.1), repealed all the acts then in force and in their place enacted that 'Every distributor, refiner,3 retail dealer or storer of gasoline ... shall pay an excise tax of six cents ($0.06) per gallon upon the selling, distributing, storing or withdrawing from storage in this State for any use, gasoline.'\n All the acts here involved declare that the excise shall not be laid upon sales in interstate commerce and that the specified tax shall be paid but once. They make the excise apply whether 'withdrawals be for sale or other use,' declare that sellers may pay on the basis of their sales and required that others upon whom the excise is laid shall compute and pay the tax on the basis of their withdrawals. All must make monthly return of 'sales and withdrawals' (Schedule 156.3) and preserve records of 'sales, distributions or withdrawals' (Schedule 156.5). Any one who shall violate any provision may be restrained 'from distributing, refining, selling or withdrawing from storage any gasoline, the sale or withdrawal of which is taxable.' (Schedule 156.18.) \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 397]\n\u00a0\n Appellee is a Delaware corporation, authorized to do business in Alabama. It sells gasoline in the 67 counties of that state. Gasoline refined at Port Arthur, Tex., is transported by barges to the company's terminals at Mobile, Ala., and Pensacola and Millville, Fla. Gasoline sold in Alabama is delivered from the Mobile terminal or the company's bulk plants in that State to which gasoline is shipped from the terminals and at which it is held in tanks until withdrawn for delivery at the plants to customers or for transportation to service stations where it is sold at retail to the public.\n Practically all the gasoline received by the United States from the company in Alabama is sold and delivered pursuant to written contracts. Some provide for deliveries at the Mobile terminal, some at bulk plants and some at service stations. The deliveries from the Mobile terminal are made in railroad tank cars on tracks adjacent to the terminal. Gasoline delivered from bulk plants is that shipped from the terminals and stored in tanks at the plants until withdrawn. That delivered from service stations is shipped from the terminals to bulk plants and thence conveyed to the stations.\n The United States requires that prices specified in bids and contracts shall be exclusive of state and municipal taxes. Between January 1, 1930, and September 22, 1935, the company sold and delivered to the United States in Alabama 286,639.36 gallons of gasoline. At the time of the trial, there were in force two contracts for sale and delivery of gasoline by the company to the United States in Alabama. One covered the period from October 1 to December 31, 1935, and called for deliveries at the Mobile terminal for the United States Army and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The other covered the period from October 1, 1935, to June 30, 1936, and called for service station deliveries for the Department of the Interior. \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 398]\n\u00a0\n March 22, 1923, the Attorney General of Alabama ruled that sales to the United States were taxable under the 1923 act. But, after our decision May 14, 1928, in the Panhandle Case, the Attorney General, August 22, 1928, held that the Alabama statutes then in force (those enacted in 1927) were not distinguishable from that of Mississippi held repugnant to the Federal Constitution in the Panhandle Case. He said: 'Alabama also (in addition to taxing selling) taxes the distributing or withdrawing from storage for any use. It taxes but once, and where there is a sale, the tax is on the sale. Where there is no sale, but a distribution or withdrawing from storage for some use, other than selling, there is a tax on such withdrawal or distribution. We are not here considering such withdrawals, but only sales to the United States.\n That construction was accepted by the state taxing officers and followed until July 5, 1935, when the then Attorney General advised the Tax Commission that the taxes levied under the Acts of 1927, 1931, and 1932 were essentially different in character from those condemned in the Panhandle Case. His ruling did not depend upon or result from the statutes enacted after 1927. He held the taxes were laid not upon sale, but upon storage and subsequent withdrawal, accruing at the time of withdrawals, and to be computed upon the basis of withdrawals. He said that 'so far as purchases of gasoline by the United States Government are concerned, these tax acts in question do not impose a burden upon the United States. ... True it may be that the effect of these taxes may be to increase the price of the commodity which the Federal Government may desire to purchase.'\n The company has not reported for taxation or paid any tax under these acts on gasoline sold to the United States since the Attorney General's ruling of August 22, 1928. On August 30, 1935, the commission informed appellee that it could not 'permit deductions from gasoline sales by \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 399]\n\u00a0\n reason of gallonage sold to the United States.' And, prior to the bringing of this suit, the sta e made demand for taxes upon all gasoline withdrawn and sold in Alabama during the preceding five years.\n Appellants say that, upon the privilege of storing gasoline, the company is subject to a tax accruing upon and measured by the amount withdrawn, irrespective of subsequent sale or use. Upon that basis they maintain that the tax in respect of gasoline sold and delivered by the company to the United States is not one that operates to retard, impede, or burden the exercise by the United States of its constitutional functions.\n But mere storing, i.e., that unassociated with selling, distributing, or withdrawing from storage, was not taxable under prior laws and is not taxable under the Act of July 10, 1935, now in force. While a storer is subject to excise in the Act of January 25, 1927 (Gen.Acts Ala.1927, p. 16 ), and subsequent statutes, storing without more is not enough to make one a storer. To be a storer, one must ship into the State and there store and withdraw gasoline for some use. Storing was not included among the acts or things taxed until the Act of July 10, 1935 (Gen.Acts Ala.1935, p. 508). That act supersedes and consolidates the earlier levies. We read its taxing clause with its other provisions that in substance were taken from the earlier statutes. In all the measures involved, it unmistakably appears-and it is conceded by the taxing officers-that one who has paid a tax on selling is not taxable on distributing, storing or withdrawing from storage. The opinion of the Attorney General, August 22, 1928, rightly held that the state taxes but once and, where there is a sale, the tax is on the sale. The purpose of the statutes subsequent to that of 1923 was to reach gasoline which was used, but not sold within the state. But, excepting only the addition of the word 'storing' in the taxing clause of the Act of July 10, 1935, there is nothing to suggest intention to tax 'storing' as such. \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 400]\n\u00a0\n Other provisions indicate that it was not the purpose so to tax. In all the acts, it is stated: The excise shall apply whether the withdrawal be for 'sale or other use'; sellers may pay on the basis of their sales but others shall pay on the basis of their withdrawals; all shall report their 'sales and withdrawals' and keep records of the 'sales, distributions or withdrawals'; violators of the act may be restrained from distributing, refining, selling, or withdrawing from storage (but not from storing) gasoline, the 'sale or withdrawal' of which is taxable. Omission of storing from these and all other provisions relating to ascertainment of amount or enforcement of the taxes imposed tend strongly to negative intention to tax storing as such.\n There are other indications that storing alone was not intended to be taxed. The tax commission has never required, and distributors, retail dealers, and stores have not made, reports in respect of gasoline until it passes from seller to purchaser or until withdrawn for use. The state has never claimed a tax upon storing of gasoline withdrawn for sale and delivery in interstate commerce. In the absence of withdrawal, there is no tax no matter how long gasoline is stored. The amount at any time received or held in storage is immaterial. The tax depends solely upon the amount withdrawn. No notice is taken of losses by evaporation or otherwise, or of storing for hire or of storing after taxable sale, distribution, or withdrawal for use. Clearly, storing alone is not the thing taxed; withdrawing is essential. Ervin v. State of Alabama (C.C.A.) 80 F.(2d) 432; Pan American Petroleum Corporation v. State of Alabama (C.C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 590; State v. City of Montgomery, 228 Ala. 93, 95, 151 So. 856; Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n255 \nU.S. 288, 293\n, 41 S.Ct. 272.\n But, assuming that, by the acts under consideration the state meant to tax mere storing, that purpose cannot be given effect in respect of the company's sales and \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 401]\n\u00a0\n deliveries to the United States without infringing the constitutional princ ple which safeguards the federal government against state taxation. Plainly, the sales and deliveries by the company to the United States necessarily include storing and withdrawal from storage. A tax upon anything so essential to the sale of the gasoline to the United States is as objectionable as would be a tax upon the sale itself. The validity of the tax is to be determined by the practical effect of enforcement. To apply any other test of constitutionality would be to treat 'a prohibition, which is general, as if it were confined to a particular mode of doing the forbidden thing.' Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 444. As held in the Panhandle Case (\n277 U.S. 218\n, at page 222, 48 S.Ct. 451, 452, 56 A.L.R. 583): 'A charge at the prescribed rate is made on account of every gallon acquired by the United States. It is immaterial that the seller and not the purchaser is required to report and make payment to the State. ... The amount of money claimed by the State rises and falls precisely as does the quantity of gasoline so secured by the government. It depends immediately upon the number of gallons.' So far as concerns the federal immunity from state taxation, a tax upon storing or withdrawal so involved cannot be distinguished from the tax on sales imposed by the Mississippi statute condemned as unconstitutional.\n Appellants suggest that appellee has an adequate remedy at law and therefore may not resort to equity.\n It was required to give a bond and obtain a license to carry on its business. Section 6, Act of October 5, 1932, Gen.Acts 1932, Ex.Sess., pp. 57, 60. It is required monthly to report and pay taxes to the tax commission for the previous month. Act of July 10, 1935, schedule 156.3.4 All, including amounts paid under protest, are by the commission handed over to the state treasurer who retains \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 402]\n\u00a0\n half and distributes the other half equally among the counties. Schedules 156.9-156.11. Failure for any month so to report is punishable by fine from $50 to $300, Schedule 156.7, and the commission is required to fix the amount of the tax and to impose a penalty of 25%, Schedule 156.14. And, in the absence of satisfactory showing by the company to the contrary, the commission may revoke its license, section 6, supra, and issue summary execution against its bond and property. The tax and penalties constitute a debt to the state and a lien upon all its property prior to all other save earlier liens for state taxes. Schedule 156.15. Appellants assume that suit to collect the taxes claimed is the only procedure contemplated. But that assumption is without support in the record. They have not bound themselves to refrain from doing anything that the statute empowers them to do to enforce payment of the taxes claimed. It does not appear that they are authorized so to bind themselves. In the absence of injunction against them, appellee, failing to pay the taxes they demand, is liable to be proceeded against in accordance with the state law.\n November 22, 1928, the Attorney General of Alabama advised the Attorney General of the United States that Alabama had no statute authorizing refund of taxes that had been collected upon sales of gasoline to the United States. January 28, 1935, the gasoline department of the Tax Commission wrote appellee that, where the tax had been paid upon gasoline furnished the United States by a dealer for appellee's account, there was no provision for refund.\n Appellants intimate, but do not definitely claim, that a distributor or dealer, if illegally compelled to pay taxes on sales to the United States, would under Alabama law be entitled to recover the amount so collected. They cite the Act of September 9, 1927, Gen.Acts 1927, p. 635. It appears to extend only to taxes paid while their \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 403]\n\u00a0\n amount or validity is in litigation. It contains no provision for interest. It was in effect when the Attorney General made his ruling of November 22, 1928. They also cite the Act of July 17, 1931, Gen. Acts 1931, p. 527. It does not permit suit, but merely authorizes the Tax Commission to refund. And finally they cite the Act of July 10, 1935. Section 379 (Gen.Acts Ala. 1935, p. 568) gives to one who has paid taxes under protest the privilege of bringing suit within 60 days against the officer making the collection; it directs the court to determine what amount, if any, is excessive or illegal and to order it to be returned with interest by the state or its agencies receiving the same. Failure to use within the specified period bars the claim. It is likely that a year or more would elapse before final determination of such a suit. In the meantime, monthly collections would have to be made, and so appellee would be compelled repeatedly, and at least as often as once every 60 days, to bring suits against the commission involving the same question. Upon obtaining the court's determination in its favor, appellee would be authorized, on presentation of certified copies of the judgment, to receive from the state the half it retained and from each of the counties its share of the other half. It would be necessary to follow the same course as to the amounts claimed in each of the suits. Resort may be had to equity in order to avoid the multiplicity of suits necessarily involved in the procedure prescribed for recovery of illegal exactions.\n Appellee suggests that the provisions of the Act of July 10, 1935, are repugnant to section 14 of the Constitution of Alabama: 'That the State of Alabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or equity.' In support of that view, it shows that, since this suit was commenced, a telephone company brought suit under section 379 in the court below against the members of the state commission, appellants here, to recover license taxes paid \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 404]\n\u00a0\n under protest, and that they have filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court, asserting that 'the real party in interest is the State of Alabama'; that section 379 purports to give the state's consent to be sued only in its own courts, and that it 'is immune from being impleaded in a court of the United States under the provisions of the Eleventh Amendment.'\n It sufficiently appears that appellee had no plain, adequate, or complete remedy at law. Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Weld County, \n247 \nU.S. 282, 285\n, 286 S., 38 S.Ct. 510; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Doughton, \n262 \nU.S. 413, 426\n, 43 S.Ct. 620; Di Giovanni v. Camden Ins.

Southern California Tel. Co., \n275 \nU.S. 393, 399\n, 400 S., 48 S.Ct. 180.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO (dissenting).\n Under the Alabama statute, the appellee, the Texas Company, is a 'storer.' It is one 'who ships or causes to be shipped or receives, gasoline into this State in any quantities, and stores the same in any manner and withdraws or uses the same for any purpose.' Gen.Acts Ala. 1935, p. 508,  348, Schedule 156. If it did business in some other way, it might be taxable as a 'distributor,' or 'refiner,' or 'retail dealer.' Doing business as it does, it is taxable as a 'storer.' It brings into Alabama a dangerous commodity which it keeps there indefinitely for indefinite uses. For the privilege of doing this it must make a payment to the state upon the termination of the storage, whether the purpose of the withdrawal is sale or something else. The statute was amended by adding the word 'storing' in order to cover \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 405]\n\u00a0\n such activities. What the lawmakers have put into a statute, a court may not take out of it.\n In its application to appellee, a tax thus conditioned is an excise upon the privilege of storage, and so the cases hold. State v. City of Montgomery, 228 Ala. 93, 151 o. 856; Ervin v. State of Alabama (C.C.A.) 80 F.(2d) 432, 433; Pan American Petroleum Corporation v. State of Alabama ( C.C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 590. It is not transformed into a tax upon something else, or, more particularly, into a tax upon the privilege of sale, because payable when the gasoline is taken out of storage or because measured by the amount withdrawn. Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport, Inc., \n289 \nU.S. 249, 252\n, 53 S.Ct. 591; Nashville, C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 268\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 87 A.L.R. 1191; Ervin v. State of Alabama, supra; Pan American Petroleum Corporation v. State of Alabama, supra; State v. City of Montgomery, supra. The nature of the excise being what it is, liability is the same whether withdrawal of the gasoline is for one purpose or another.\n Panhandle Oil Co. v. Knox, \n277 \nU.S. 218\n, 48 S.Ct. 451, 56 A.L.R. 583, is not a decision to the contrary. The tax considered in that case and condemned when applied to transactions with the government was upon the privilege of sale exclusively, and not upon some activity or condition antecedent thereto. The decision evoked dissent from four members of the court. It is now carried to new bounds by the ruling that 'a tax upon anything so essential to the sale of the gasoline to the United States (as storage followed by withdrawal) is as objectionable as would be a tax upon the sale itself.' If that ruling is to stand, it will equally forbid a tax upon the process of refining or upon transportation to a market (Wheeler Lumber B. & S. Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 572\n, 50 S.Ct. 419), since these, as much as storage, are preliminary to sale. Cf. Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport, Inc., supra; Nashville, C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Wallace, supra. Not yet has the \n\n[298 U.S. 393, 406]\n\u00a0\n immunity of government from indirect obstructions been pushed to that extreme.\n Gasoline refined in Texas and transported to Alabama to be stored in tanks or terminals is there for general uses. Part of it in the usual course of business will be sold to the United States; part of it will be sold to others; part will be withdrawn without sale to any one. This is not to say that the result would be any different though a definite sale were in view at the beginning of the storage. Even in such conditions, storage, like transportation, would be 'not part of the sale but preliminary to it and wholly the vendor's affair.' Wheeler Lumber B. & S. Co. v. United states, supra, \n281 U.S. 572\n, at page 579, 50 S.Ct. 419, 421. However, the indefinite extension of the uses simplifies the problem. The burden, if any, upon the activities of government is remote and indeterminate. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 46 S. Ct. 172; Burnet v. A. T. Jergins Trust, \n288 \nU.S. 508\n, 53 S. Ct. 439; Trinityfarm Construction Co. v. Grosjean, \n291 \nU.S. 466\n, 54 S.Ct. 469. Sales to the United States are made under contracts for a stated term. There is no assurance that the tax or any part of it will be shifted to the buyer.\n The decree should be reversed, and the bill dismissed.\n I am authorized to state that Mr. Justice BRANDEIS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The government's brief states: On the basis of purchases in Alabama during the current year, it is estimated that the total annual added cost of gasoline would amount to $143.145.54. If Alabama succeeds in collecting the tax, other states will probably modify their statutes to produce a similar revenue; it is estimated that this would add a burden of $4,479, 661.40 per year upon the United States. That figure is arrived at on the basis of 4 cents a gallon. The use of fuel oil by the Navy Department, which purchased 273,354,228 gallons in 1934, suggests a further burden on the United States. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Enacted Feb. 10, 1923, Gen.Acts 1923, p. 36, and amended August 27, 1927, Gen.Acts 1927, p. 326; January 25, 1927, Gen.Acts 1927, p. 16; July 27, 1931, Gen.Acts 1931, p. 859; November 5, 1932, Gen.Acts 1932, Ex.Sess., p. 314; January 31, 1935, Gen.Acts 1935, p. 30; July 10, 1935, Gen.Acts 1935, p. 508. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The term 'refiner' first appears in the 1932 act; it has no application to this case. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The same provisions are found in the statutes repealed by the Act of July 10, 1935. \n\n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT NORTHERN R. CO. v. WEEKS(1936)\nNo. 178\nArgued: Decided: February 3, 1936\n\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 135, 137]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. F. G. Dorety, of St. Paul, Minn., and C. J. Murphy, of Grand Forks, N.D., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harold D. Shaft, of Grand Forks, N.D., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal District Court for North Dakota by petitioner against the state tax commissioner and the auditors and treasurers of thirty counties to enjoin collection of about 40 per cent. of 1933 taxes laid upon its railroad properties in each county. The assessed value of all petitioner's railroad property in the state is $78, 832,888. The total of the tax is $1,508,352.34, of which petitioner has paid about 60 per cent. The suit is grounded upon the claim that the tax  are based on a valuation that \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 138]\n\u00a0\n includes properties located outside the state and in other respects are so excessive and arbitrary as to be repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to, and the commerce clause ( article 1,  8, cl. 3), of, the Federal Constitution. Issues were joined, the case was tried, the court made findings of fact, concluded that petitioner was not entitled to relief, and dismissed the bill. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 77 F.(2d) 405.\n The state law requires that all property subject to taxation be assessed at its true and full value in money. Comp. Laws 1913,  2122, as amended by Laws 1925, c. 206,  2. The state board of equalization is required in August of each year to assess at its actual value every railroad within the state and it is governed by the rules that apply to township assessors in valuing other property. Section 2242. 1925 Supp.  2141a3. The average values per mile of main and branch lines, respectively, constitute the bases for assignment of value to counties. Section 2243. And on like mileage bases the value given to each county is distributed to its cities, towns, townships, and districts through which the railroad extends. Section 2244. The railroad property is taxed, as is personal property, by applying the local rate to 50 per cent. of the assessed value. 1 Petitioner did not allege that other property was not assessed at its full and true value as required by state law and does not seek relief on the ground of discrimination.\n Petitioner claims that the board made the assessment by attributing to North Dakota too great a proportion of a grossly excessive system valuation. More specifically its contentions are: (1) That, by reason of the methods employed for the ascertainment of the percentage of system value to be assigned to North Dakota, the assessment \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 139]\n\u00a0\n includes the value of property located in other states to the extent of approximately $20,000,000, and (2) that, even if the factors used to make the allocation be not condemned, the assessment must nevertheless be held arbitrary and excessive to the extent of $15,000,000.\n The full and true value of the property is the amount that the owner would be entitled to receive as just compensation upon a taking of that property by the state or the United States in the exertion of the power of eminent domain. That value is the equivalent of the property, in money paid at the time of the taking. Olson v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 246, 254\n, 54 S.Ct. 704. The principles governing the ascertainment of value for the purposes of taxation are the same as those that control in condemnation cases, confiscation cases, and generally in controversies involving the ascertainment of just compensation. West v. Chesapeake & P. Tel. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 662, 671\n, 55 S.Ct. 894\n\n\n In determining the amount of the assessment, the board was not bound by any formula, rule, or method, but for guidance to right judgment it was free to consider all pertinent facts, estimates, and forecasts and to give to them such weight as reasonably they might be deemed to have. Courts decline to disturb assessments for taxation unless shown clearly to transgress reasonable limits. Overvaluation is not of itself sufficient to warrant injunction against any part of the taxes based on the challenged assessment; mere error of judgment is not enough; there must be something that in legal effect is the equivalent of intention or fraudulent purpose to overvalue the property and so to set at naught fundamental principles that safeguard the taxpayer's rights and property. Rowley v. Chicago & N.W. R. Co., \n293 U.S. 102\n, 109-111, 55 S.Ct. 55. The assessment is presumed to have been rightly made on the basis of actual value. Its validity must be tested upon consideration of the facts established by the evidence and of those of which judicial notice may be taken. \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 140]\n\u00a0\n There is controversy between the parties as to whether the evidence discloses how the assessment was made. Petitioner maintains that the record shows that the board found system value and apportioned it to North Dakota and also shows the methods by which these determinations were made. The District Court refused to find, and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that petitioner failed to prove, that the board made the valuation by methods which petitioner claims that it employed.\n\n 1. \nAs to methods employed by the board. Respondents called as a witness Mr. Lyman A. Baker who had been with the North Dakota tax commissioner for nineteen years and during the last thirteen years, ending January 1, 1933, had been deputy commissioner in charge of the valuation of railroads and other utilities. He was engaged in this litigation in behalf of respondents and spent much time in making computations and in the preparation of exhibits that were put in evidence by respondents. In substance he testified:\n The first step in the valuation of railroad property within a state is to determine the value of the entire system. There are two cases of evidence ordinarily considered: The average market price of stock and bonds, and the past earnings over a period of years. As the stock and bond prices reflect value of the entire railroad, it is necessary to eliminate the value of nonoperating property. The method requires a definite period over which to average price quotations and that must of necessity be somewhat arbitrarily fixed. It assumes that the average price reflects value, but rarely is controlling interest bought or sold on the exchange. Where control is sought, prices advance sharply. The method also assumes that purchasers act on accurate knowledge of conditions; it ignores the influence of pure speculation. In applying the method, taxing boards, economists, and railroad men have always adopted five-year periods immediately pre- \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 141]\n\u00a0\n ceding the assessment in order to give stability to the tax value. The depression resulted in a collapse in the stock and bond market. Forced selling brought prices down to a figure that did not fairly represent the value of the property. 'Despite all these objections to the stock and bond method of valuation, I still consider it as one of the best indices of value obtainable.'\n He further testified: Capitalization of net railroad operating income is generally recognized as an important element in estimating the value of railroad operating property. The average net income, usually for five years, is capitalized at a reasonable rate of return. The method assumes the amount so ascertained to be the value of the property. The income of a single year is seldom, if ever, used. As 1931 and 1932 were the worst years in railroad history since the panic of 1893, the use of the three- year period ending in 1932 has but little justification. The five-year period has been given the same weight by the state board for a good many years. It is generally considered that the rate of return that a company is allowed to earn under state and federal law is a fair rate to use. A rate of 6 per cent. is justifiable under present conditions. Economic return from farm property, being about 65 per cent. of all that is taxable in North Dakota, decreased about 75 per cent. from the 1924-1928 average. Assessments on values indicated by capitalization of average net income for the five years ending in 1932 would result in giving preferential treatment to railroads as compared with other properties. Where properties have been operated at a loss over a period of years, there are no earnings to capitalize. Yet they have present and prospective value which would be reflected by use of the stock and bond valuation method. The criticisms made of these methods are not sufficient to render them valueless. 'On the contrary the two methods are universally approved as the two best evidences of the value of a railroad which are available.' \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 142]\n\u00a0\n The answer alleges: In 1932 the tax commissioner made and presented to the board computations based upon a determination of system value by the use of a composite of the average stock and bond values of the petitioner for a period of five years preceding the assessment and the average value ascertained by capitalizing net earnings for the same period; by apportioning the system value to North Dakota upon the basis of the average of five factors: (1) Miles of all track, (2) physical property, (3) car and locomotive miles, (4) ton and passenger miles, (5) gross earnings, there was produced a value of $76,115,715; another apportionment on the basis of the three use factors, viz., car and locmotive miles, ton and passenger miles, and gross earnings, produced $79,417,825, and a third apportionment by the average of track miles and the three use factors produced $80,671,790. The answer further alleged that 'upon this evidence and upon all other evidence and matters of common knowledge before it the Board did in the year 1932 fix the valuation of plaintiff's property in North Dakota at $78,850,024'; that in 1933 the commissioner and the railway company presented to the board the financial and operating statistics of the plaintiff's railroad and reports and computations based upon the formulas used in 1932 and other evidence of value, and that the board after full consideration of them and all other evidence of value and matters of common knowledge fixed the assessment for 1933 at $78,832,888 'which said amount represented the honest judgment' of the board 'and the full and true value of the plaintiff's North Dakota property in money.\n The average of the valuations computed for 1932 as alleged in the answer is $78,735,110; the assessment was $78,850,024. The difference is less than one-sixth of 1 per cent. The trial court found that for 1933 the board assessed the property at 'the sum of $78,832,888, which sum was the same as the 1932 assessment except for a \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 143]\n\u00a0\n deduction of $17,136 for certain trackage of the plaintiff which had been removed.'\n It is clear that the computations prepared by the tax commissioner for the use of the board served as guides to, if indeed they were not used as the measure of, value for the assessments made by the board for 1932 and 1933. Respondents' answer and evidence require a finding that these computations were in fact the controlling bases and constituted the very foundation of the 1932 and 1933 assessments. In view of the relatively small differences between the 1933 assessment and the figures produced by the methods approved by respondents and universally as the best available evidence of value of a railroad, the latter rightly may be used in testing the validity of the former.\n\n 2. \nPetitioner's claim that the board's apportionment of system value to North Dakota operated to assess and tax property in other states cannot be upheld.\n Petitioner maintains that the amount attributed to that state was found by the use of the factors above referred to. More fully described, they are: (1) Miles of all track (as of December 31, 1931)-20.19 per cent. ( 2) Physical property as measured by cost of reproduction less depreciation ( as of December 31, 1931)-13.84 per cent. (3) Car and locomotive miles ( average for five years ending with 1931)-19.90 per cent. (4) Ton and passenger milles (average for five years ending with 1931)-18.65 per cent. ( 5) Gross earnings, average for five years ending with 1931)-18.45 per cent; the amount assigned to North Dakota was found by adding to the intrastate revenue earned in that state its mileage proportion of revenue derived from traffic moving partly within and partly outside her boundaries. The average of these percentages is 18.206 per cent.\n The principal grounds on which petitioner assails the board's apportionment are: Petitioner's railroad in North Dakota consists largely of elatively cheaper branch lines. \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 144]\n\u00a0\n The most valuable terminals and costly construction are in other states and, while these include little mileage, they contribute as much to system value in proportion to cost as do the cheaper stretches of the road where the same investment is spread over much greater mileage.\n The problem of apportionment is a difficult one. It is impossible to formulate a rule generally applicable. Controlling conditions vary greatly from time to time. Allocations to be sufficiently accurate for practical purposes must be arrived at by the exercise of sound judgment based on facts that fairly reflect the relation between value of the system as a whole and value of the part within a state. Rowley v. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co., supra, \n293 \nU.S. 102, 109\n, 110 S., 55 S.Ct. 55.\n The methods proposed by petitioner discredit its objections to the apportionment made by the board. While the board had the 1933 assessment under consideration, petitioner submitted to it a brief in which it proposed two methods of apportionment. One was by use of the above described factors 1, 3, 4, and 5, and the other by use of 3, 4, and 5, producing, respectively, as calculated by petitioner, 19.35 per cent. and 19.14 per cent. These percentages are higher than the average of those that petitioner says the board used. There is no evidence that the assessment was arrived at by use of apportioning percentages higher than those then used by petitioner.\n Petitioner's bill suggests a method of apportionment that would assign to North Dakota less than 12 1\/2 per cent. of system value. Briefly, the method is this: To the revenue derived from North Dakota intrastate traffic add a part of the revenue received from the interstate moving in North Dakota that is equal to its proportion of the property used in, and the cost of, carrying that traffic; deduct the operating expenses incurred in moving it from the total revenue. The relation of the state net earnings \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 145]\n\u00a0\n so found to the net for the system will be the same as that existing between North Dakota value and system value. As petitioner gives this method scant, if any, support here and as it was rejected by the lower courts, we need not consider it. U.S. v. State Investment Co., \n264 \nU.S. 206, 211\n, 44 S.Ct. 289; Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Ry. & S. S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 558\n, 50 S.Ct. 427; U.S. v. Commercial Credit Co., \n286 \nU.S. 63, 67\n, 52 S.Ct. 467.\n And here petitioner argues that the apportionment should be made on the basis of physical property, i.e., factor 2 above described. That would assign to North Dakota less than 15 per cent. of the system value. Petitioner did not submit it to the board as the measure or even include it in the group of factors upon which it based the calculations included in its brief. It is not sustained by evidence.\n When regard is had to the size of the Great Northern system and the variety of things that affect values to be attributed to its railroad in different states and the numerous matters as to which there may be wide difference of opinion, it must be held that percentages lower than, or substantially the same as, those petitioner itself used and submitted to the board are not confiscatory or arbitrary. Helvering v. Taylor, \n293 \nU.S. 507\n, 55 S.Ct. 287, has no bearing.\n\n 3. \nThere remains to consider whether the assessment may be sustained against petitioner's claim that, assuming validity of apportionment, the valuation was arbitrarily made and is grossly excessive.\n No testimony was given by the tax commissioner or any other member of the board. They could not be compelled to submit to examination as to the operation of their minds in making the challenged assessment. Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. Co. v. Babcock, \n204 \nU.S. 585, 593\n, 27 S.Ct. 326; Bohler v. Callaway, \n267 \nU.S. 479, 491\n, 45 S.Ct. 431. It results that resort must be had to determinations of the board, find- \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 146]\n\u00a0\n ings of the lower courts, the evidence, and the facts judicially known.\n From the answer and evidence, it unquestionably appears that the board valued petitioner's system and made apportionment to North Dakota. The assessments for the years 1929-1933 are: $83,294,677, $83,294,688, $82, 999,997, $78,850,024, and $78,832,888. The trial judge found no overassessment for 1932, but refused to find the value of the property in 1933 or whether the assessment for that year was excessive; and he found that there is no evidence, other than that offered to show overvaluation, that the assessment was fraudulent or made with intent to defraud petitioner. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that petitioner failed to prove the method employed by the board to make the assessment or that it was grossly excessive and arbitrary.\n Respondents' witness prepared tabulations which were put in evidence as Exhibit P. It shows: (1) The value for each year, based on averages for preceding five years, from 1929 to 1933, inclusive, of the system operating property as indicated by: (a) Stock and bond value less value of nonoperating property; (b) net operating income capitalized at 6 per cent .; (c) the average of (a) and (b). (2) Apportionment of system value to North Dakota by percentages reflected by average of: (a) Three use factors, i.e., transportation service, traffic units, and gross operating revenue; ( b) mileage of tracks operated and the three use factors; (c) mileage of tracks owned and operated and leased and operated and the three use factors; (d) mileage of track operated, physical property, and the three use factors; (e) mileage of track operated, physical property, the three use factors, and net revenue. (3) Apportionment to North Dakota of: (a) Stock and bond value; (b) capitalized value; (c) average of (a) and (b). 4. The North Dakota assessments. Ratio of assessments to apportionments made on (a) stock and \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 147]\n\u00a0\n bond value; (b) capitalized value; (c) average of (a) and (b).2\n The composite of the five-year average of stock and bond value and of net operating income capitalized for 1932 was $415,278,961; admittedly that was produced by the use of the two methods shown by respondents' witness to be universally approved as the best methods for finding system value. The 1932 assessment is 99.93 per cent. of that figure apportioned on the basis of the three use fac- \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 148]\n\u00a0\n tors, 98.39 per cent. apportioned on the basis of track mileage operated and three use factors; 96.02 per cent. apportioned on tracks owned and operated and leased and operated and the three use factors, 104.29 per cent. apportioned on track mileage, physical property, and the three use factors; 101.40 per cent. apportioned on track operated, physical property, three use factors, and net revenue.\n If the system value for 1933 had been computed on the basis of the stock and bond and capitalized income methods used for 1932, it would have been $345,188,820, about 83 per cent. of the corresponding figure for 1932, less than 76 per cent. of like figures for 1932 and 1930, and about 79 per cent. of that for 1929. See footnote 2. The 1933 assessment exceeds what would have been made on system valuation based on the five-year average of stock and bond values, apportioned by use of the five factors above described (advocated by the state as 'the fairest basis of allocation') by 19.97 per cent., exceeds that based on net operating income capitalized by 29.44 per cent., on the composite of both by 24.52 per cent. The testimony and computations made by respondents' witness show that the 1933 assessment could not have \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 149]\n\u00a0\n been arrived at by any calculation based on the principles and methods governing the tax commissioner in his computations submitted to the board through a period of years and constituting the controlling bases of the assessments made by it. The five-year average of the composite of the stock and bond and capitalized income values, held by all to be the best method, produced for 1932 a valuation within one-sixth of 1 per cent. of the assessment for that year. The board arbitrarily adopted that assessment, less value of a short stretch of track removed, as the assessment for 1933. If the assessment for that year had been based on the principles governing in 1932 and preceding years, it would have been less by about $13,000,000 than the amount fixed by the board and here in controversy.\n The long period through which, even in 1933, the depression had extended compelled the conclusion that it was not temporary. Judicial notice must be taken of the fact that late in 1929 there occurred a great collapse of values of all classes of property-railroads, other utilities, commodities, and securities, and that the depression then commenced progressively became greater. In making assess ents in that period, the board was bound to take into account and give due weight to the sudden, progressive, and enormous declines of value.\n Respondents' witness testified: The purchasing power of money greatly increased and correspondingly values decreased from 1929 to 1933. The Dow- Jones & Co. average of 30 industrial stocks fell from 383.17 in September, 1929, to 41.22 in July, 1932. The average of 20 railroad stocks fell between the same dates from 189.11 to 13.23; total market value of all common and preferred stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange fell from eighty-nine and one-half billion to fifteen and one-half billion dollars. Assessing officials and equalizing boards were confronted with a very difficult situation. \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 150]\n\u00a0\n 'Values which had been more or less stable for a generation have melted rapidly away. If all assessments had been reduced to conform to actual market value, the State and its subdivisions would have ceased to function, as the revenue would not even approximate necessary expenses.'\n Changed business conditions affecting petitioner's traffic, coupled with competition from new methods of transportation, precluded belief that prospective improvement in petitioner's business and earnings would within a reasonable time, if ever, be sufficient to justify the assessment in question. Cf. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Walters, \n294 \nU.S. 405, 423\n, 55 S.Ct. 486. But from 1929 to and including 1933 the board reduced assessments of petitioner's North Dakota railroad properties by less than 6 per cent. It is everywhere known that the general decline in values in that period was very much greater than that. The evidence conclusively shows that the value of petitioner's system and of its North Dakota railroad properties declined several times 6 per cent. Its traffic, gross earnings, and net income from operation fell off enormously. \n3\n The 1929 collapse and the decline progressively following it resulted in much lower levels of prices and values which at least as early as 1933 were to be regarded \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 151]\n\u00a0\n not as temporary but as at least relatively permanent. Atchison, etc., Ry. Co. v. U.S., \n284 \nU.S. 248, 260\n, 261 S., 52 S.Ct. 146; Los Angeles Gas, etc., Corp. v. R.R. Comm., \n289 \nU.S. 287, 311\n, 312 S., 53 S.Ct. 637.\n In cases such as this, courts are not permitted to weigh evidence of value. They may not substitute their opinions for the findings of assessing officers or boards. But, when the jurisdiction of the District Court is appropriately invoked, it is its duty to decide upon the merits of the taxpayer's claim that the assessment of his property was arbitrarily made and is grossly excessive. It clearly appears that the board failed to give reasonable weight to the falling off of petitioner's traffic, gross earnings, operating income, the extraordinary shrinkage in values of railroad properties, the prices of commodities, and securities generally. The value of petitioner's property varied with the profitableness of its use, present and prospective. Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. Railway Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439, 445\n, 14 S.Ct. 1122; Southern Ry. Co. v. Kentucky, \n274 \nU.S. 76, 81\n, 82 S., 47 S.Ct. 542. Petitioner's system net operating income was for 1929 in round figures $32,457,000; in the following years $21,912,000, $12,669,000, $1, 290,000. The board persistently disregarded known conditions essential to the just ascertainment of value. W ile the vanishing of values described by respondents' witness, the reduction of the tax base from 75 per cent. to 50 per cent. and the established limitations upon rates of taxation justify diligence on the part of the assessing authorities that taxable property be assessed at full value, neither these nor any other conditions warrant or excuse arbitrary or excessive valuations.\n The facts alleged in respondents' answer and those shown by the testimony of their witness and his computations above described compel the conclusion that, by reason of changed conditions affecting value, the methods or system by which the board arrived at the 1933 value of petitioner's railway as a whole were plainly calculated \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 152]\n\u00a0\n to produce a grossly excessive assessment of its North Dakota property for that year. That assessment being shown to have been arbitrarily made and grossly excessive, petitioner's right to relief was not conditioned upon overassessment or upon its submission to overtaxation in 1932 or any prior year. It follows that the lower courts erred in holding that petitioner was not entitled to any relief. The evidence persuasively supports petitioner's claim that by reason of system overvaluation the North Dakota assessment was too high by $15,000,000. And, resolving all doubts in favor of validity, the evidence must be held conclusively to show that the challenged assessment exceeds the true and full value of petitioner's North Dakota railroad properties in 1933 by $10,000,000. See footnote 2. The board's failure to consider the enormous diminution in value of petitioner's property caused by the 1929 collapse and the progress of the depression is, within the principles of our decisions, the equivalent in law of intention to make a grossly excessive assessment for 1933 in disregard of petitioner's rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We need not consider whether the assessment is repugnant to the equal protection or commerce clause. Unquestionably, the assessment was made in plain violation of established principles that govern property valuation. Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490, 502\n, 24 S.Ct. 498; Rowley v. Chicago & N.W. Ry.

And the decree shall declare that it is without prejudice to the authority of the state board of equalization, if any it has, again to assess petitioner's properties for 1933.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n The decision of the Court turns on the constitutionality of the valuation, for 1933 taxation, of so much of petitioner's railroad as is located in North Dakota.\n The Court finds that the valuation of the railroad within the state is not so disproportionate to the value of petitioner's entire railroad system as to transcend due process. See Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490, 500\n, 24 S.Ct. 498; compare Rowley v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., \n293 U.S. 102\n, 109-111, 55 S.Ct. 55. It does not find, and there is no contention, that there has been any discrimination in the valuation of petitioner's property as compared with that of other property in the state. Its decision that the tax is invalid rests on the single ground that the valuation is excessive.\n This conclusion is based on an elaborate examination of the evidence produced before the trial court, evidence which it is assumed affords the only basis for the valuation of the Board of Equalization. Emphasizing as the important, if not controlling factors, in determining taxable value, the depressed market value of the securities of the entire railroad, representing its property in many states, its diminished earnings, its capitalized value based \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 154]\n\u00a0\n on what it considers, for this purpose, a fair rate of return, the Court concludes that, as prices of securities and earnings were much lower in 1933 than in 1932 and earlier years, the valuation of the railroad property in North Dakota for that year should have been correspondingly reduced. And because the decline in value found by this formula is substantial, something like 20 per cent., and as the Board placed the same valuation on the property in 1933 as in 1932, it is declared that the valuation is so arbitrary as to make any tax based upon it a violation of due process.\n We may lay aside any consideration of the numerous uncertain and imponderable elements involved in valuation of a railroad which may well make the use of such a formula untrustworthy in times like the present, see Rowley v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., supra, \n293 \nU.S. 102, 109\n, 55 S.Ct. 55; which would seem to make it impossible for a court to say that the rejection of the results of such a formula by the taxing officials involved anything more than the exercise of an authorized judgment, which courts cannot pronounce arbitrary merely because it does not conform to their own.\n The feature of the decision which is especially a matter of concern is that for the first time this Court is setting aside a tax as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment on the ground that the assessment on which it is computed is too high, without any showing that the assessment is discriminatory or that petitioner is in any way bearing an undue share of the tax burden imposed on all property owners in the state.\n Assessment for taxation is a quasi judicial act and the tax assessment has the quality of a judgment. Hagar v. Reclamation District, \n111 \nU.S. 701, 709\n, 4 S.Ct. 663; Gallup v. Schmidt, \n183 \nU.S. 300\n, 22 S.Ct. 162; Londoner v. City & County of Denver, \n210 \nU.S. 373, 386\n, 28 S.Ct. 708; Turner v. Wade, \n254 \nU.S. 64\n, 41 S.Ct. 27. Even if the valuation of the Board be erroneous, the errors of a state \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 155]\n\u00a0\n judicial officer, however gross, whether of law or of fact, are not violations of the Constitution and are not open to review in the federal courts merely because they are errors. If overvaluation, even though gross or intentional, were, without more, held to infringe the Fourteenth Amendment, every taxpayer would be at liberty to ask the federal courts to review a state tax assessment upon the bare allegation that it is grossly excessive, and without showing that it does more than subject him to taxation on the same basis as every other taxpayer.\n It has long been recognized that discrimination between taxpayers, if intentional or so persistent as to be systematic, is a denial of equal protection, whether the discrimination is in the application of different rates to property in the same class or in inequality in its valuation. Iowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239, 245\n, 52 S.Ct. 133; Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board of Revision, \n284 U.S. 23\n, 25ff, 52 S.Ct. 48; Chicago G.W.R. Co. v. Kendall, \n266 \nU.S. 94, 98\n, 99 S., 45 S.Ct. 55; Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, \n260 \nU.S. 441, 445\n, 43 S.Ct. 190, 28 A.L.R 979; Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., \n207 \nU.S. 20, 37\n, 28 S.Ct. 7, 12 Ann.Cas. 757. But to hold that a tax is unconstitutional because based upon an assessment which is too high, as compared with the value of the same property for purposes of condemnation, overlooks the principle upon which property taxes are laid and collected. Taxation is but a method of raising revenue to defray the expenses of government, and of distributing the burden among those who must bear it. The taxpayer cannot complain of the tax burden which he has to bear, who shows no inequality in the application of it. And plainly he does not show inequality merely by proving that the valuation of his property for taxation is much higher than its market or its condemnation value.\n The burden of a property tax like the present is distributed by applying a rate of tax to the assessed valuation of all taxable property. Variation of either, without \n\n[297 U.S. 135, 156]\n\u00a0\n discrimination, affects the amount of the tax but not the equality of its distribution. The activities and expenses of government, over which the state has plenary control, do not cease in time of depression. They may increase. The state may meet those expenses by raising the valuation of taxable property, or by raising tax rates, or both, without infringing any constitutional immunity. Here the state, so far as appears, is raising the needed revenue and distributing the burden as in previous years, by continuing old valuations. However high those valuations may be, if not discriminatory, they impose no unequal share of the tax burden on petitioner and cannot be said to be arbitrary or oppressive in the constitutional sense.\n Recently we held that a claim that the rate of a nondiscriminatory tax is excessively high presents no constitutional question. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40, 44\n, 54 S.Ct. 599. No reason has been advanced at the bar, or given in the opinion of the Court, why a tax valuation, excessive when compared with condemnation or market value, should have any different legal consequences. In neither case is inequality of the tax burden established. It is for that reason that this Court has held, without exception, that valuation of property for tax purposes, however excessive, not shown to be discriminatory, infringes no constitutional immunity. Rowley v. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co., supra, \n293 \nU.S. 102, 111\n, 55 S.Ct. 55; Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519, 526\n, 43 S.Ct. 192; and see Cumberland Coal Co. v.

In such cases the complainant, because the valuation is too high or too low, suffers a harm from which the Constitution guarantees immunity. But the Constitution guarantees no immunity from taxation even though the tax, because of its amount, may be burdensome, see Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, supra, or because it is as high in a year of depression and falling property values as in years of prosperity. Beyond this petitioner does not show that it is harmed, or present any case for invoking the protection of the Constitution.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Comp.Laws 1913,  2244.

Calder Mackay, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. John MacC. Hudson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The parties disagree as to petitioner's right to deduct from gross income for 1924 unamortized discount, premiums, and expenses paid and incurred in that year in connection with the retirement of certain bonds. The petitioner took the deduction in its income tax return. \n\n[297 U.S. 543, 544]\n\u00a0\n The respondent disallowed it and determined a deficiency. The petitioner appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, which held the deduction proper. \n1\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board's decision in part. \n2\n We granted the writ to resolve a conflict. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n March 1, 1919, the company executed a mortgage securing four series of bonds, one of which was designated 'Series B 7%.' February 1, 1921, the company executed another mortgage, securing bonds known as 'General Lien Convertible 8% Gold Bonds,' and thereby covenanted to deposit and pledge with the trustee Series B 7's equal in par value to the General Lien 8's at any time outstanding. The indenture provided that when this should be accomplished the debtor should have the right to redeem the General 8's at 105 and accrued interest, the holders to have the option to receive cash or Series B bonds, of equal face value, plus 5 per cent. in cash. The General Lien 8's were issued at a discount of $150,000 and an expense of $ 22,283.54. Prior to December 31, 1923, certain General Lien 8's had been redeemed for cash and the then unamortized discount and expense allocable to the bonds retired had been charged off in the year of retirement. May 8, 1924, the company called the remaining outstanding General Lien 8's for redemption August 1, 1924. The holders of $2,354,000 face value exercised the option to exchange for Series B 7's at par and a cash premium of 5 per cent. The total premium paid to them was $117,725 and the expense of the conversion was $1,461.05. The unamortized discount and expense of issuance in respect of the General Lien 8's thus exchanged, at the date of exchange, was $126,176.97. For the remaining General Lien 8's, which were not ex- \n\n[297 U.S. 543, 545]\n\u00a0\n changed for Series B 7's, cash was paid at the rate of 105 per cent. of par and the company incurred certain expenses in the transaction. The total of the premium, the expense, and the unamortized discount applicable to all of the bonds redeemed for cash or in exchange for Series B bonds was charged off in 1924 and taken as a deduction from income for that year. The company keeps its accounts on the accrual basis. The Commissioner disallowed the entire deduction, but before the Board he admitted the propriety of so much of it as applied to bonds redeemed for cash. He insisted, however, that as to those retired by exchange of the Series B 7's the discount, premium, and expense should be amortized over the life of the latter. The Board overruled his contention, but the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained it, holding that the items would not be deductible as realized losses until payment or redemption of the Series B bonds, and should be amortized in annual instalments during their term.\n Section 234(a) of the Revenue Act of 19244 directs that in computing the net income of a corporation subject to the tax there shall be allowed as deductions ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on the business, interest paid or accrued within the year on indebtedness, and losses sustained during the year not compensated by insurance or otherwise. The Treasury promulgated a regulation under the Revenue Act of 1918 covering treatment of discounts and premiums, which, with immaterial changes, has remained in force under all the revenue acts and appears as article 545 of Regulations 65 applicable to the Revenue Act of 1924.5 \n\n[297 U.S. 543, 546]\n\u00a0\n Although the article does not expressly cover the items in question other than discount and premiums paid at redemption, expense in connection with the issuance of the securities is deductible on the same theory as unamortized discount. \n6\n It has accordingly been held that where an issue of bonds is retired for cash, whether the cash be obtained by the sale of a new issue or not, the items in question are deductible in the year of retirement. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The question then is whether, upon an exchange of one obligation for another which is to be retired, the transaction is to be viewed as if the retirement were accomplished by the payment of cash. If the retired bonds had not been called, the expense items incurred in connection with their issuance would properly be amortized over the remainder of their life. Here the petitioner substituted a new obligation for the old. The remaining unamortized expenses of issue of the original bonds and the expense of the exchange are both expenses attributable to the issuance of the new bonds and should be treated as a part of the cost of obtaining the loan. They should, accordingly, be \n\n[297 U.S. 543, 547]\n\u00a0\n amortized annually throughout the term of the bonds delivered in exchange for those retired.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 30 B.T.A. 503. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 79 F.(2d) 94. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] San Joaquin L. & P.

AMERICAN PRESS CO.(1936)\nNo. 303\nArgued: Decided: February 10, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana. \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 234]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles J. Rivet, of New Orleans, La., and Gaston L. Porterie, Atty. Gen., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Esmond Phelps, of New Orleans, La., and Elisha Hanson, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n\n[297 U.S. 233, 240]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by appellees, nine publishers of newspapers in the state of Louisiana, to enjoin the enforcement against them of the provisions of section 1 of the act of the Legislature of Louisiana known as Act No. 23, passed and approved July 12, 1934, as follows: 'That every person, firm, association or corporation, domestic or foreign, engaged in the business of selling, or making any charge for, advertising or for advertisements, whether printed or published, or to be printed or published, in any newspaper, magazine, periodical or publication whatever having a circulation of more than 20,000 copies per week, or displayed and exhibited, or to be displayed and exhibited, by means of moving pictures, in the State of Louisiana, shall, in addition to all other taxes and licenses levied and assessed in this State, pay a license tax for the privilege of engaging in such business in this State of two per cent. (2%) of the gross receipts of such business.'\n The nine publishers who brought the suit publish thirteen newspapers; and these thirteen publications are the \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 241]\n\u00a0\n only ones within the state of Louisiana having each a circulation of more than 20,000 copies per week, although the lower court finds there are four other daily newspapers each having a circulation of 'slightly less than 20, 000 copies pert week' which are in competition with those published by appellees both as to circulation and as to advertising. In addition, there are 120 weekly newspapers published in the state, also in competition, to a greater or less degree, with the newspapers of appellees. The revenue derived from appellees' newspapers comes almost entirely from regular subscribers or purchasers thereof and from payments received for the insertion of advertisements therein.\n The act requires every one subject to the tax to file a sworn report every three months showing the amount and the gross receipts from the business described in section 1. The resulting tax must be paid when the report is filed. Failure to file the report or pay the tax as thus provided constitutes a misdemeanor and subjects the offender to a fine not exceeding $500, or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both, for each violation. Any corporation violating the acts subjects itself to the payment of $500 to be recovered by suit. All of the appellees are corporations. The lower court entered a decree for appellees and granted a permanent injunction. (D.C.) 10 F.Supp. 161.\n First. Appellant assails the federal jurisdiction of the court below on the ground that the matter in controversy does not exceed the sum or value of $3,000, as required by paragraph 1 of section 24 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.A.  41(1). The case arises under the Federal Constitution; and the bill alleges, and the record shows, that the requisite amount is involved in respect of each of six of the nine appellees. This is enough to sustain the jurisdiction of the District Court. The motion was to dismiss the bill-that is to say, the bill in its entirety-and in that form it was properly denied. No motion to dismiss was made or considered \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 242]\n\u00a0\n by the lower court as to the three appellees in respect of whom the jurisdictional amount was insufficient, and that question, therefore, is not before us. The Rio Grande, 19 Wall. 178, 189; Gibson v. Shufeldt, \n122 \nU.S. 27, 32\n, 7 S.Ct. 1066\n\n\n Second. The objection also is made that the bill does not make a case for equitable relief. But the objection is clearly without merit. As pointed out in Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n279 \nU.S. 813, 815\n, 49 S.Ct. 256, the laws of Louisiana afford no remedy whereby restitution of taxes and property exacted may be enforced, even where payment has been made under both protest and compulsion. It is true that the present act contains a provision (section 5) to the effect that where it is established to the satisfaction of the Supervisor of Public Accounts of the state that any payment has been made under the act which was 'not due and collectible,' the supervisor is authorized to refund the amount out of any funds on hand collected by virtue of the act and not remitted to the state treasurer according to law. It seems clear that this refers only to a payment not due and collectible within the terms of the act, and does not authorize a refund on the ground that the act is invalid. Moreover, the act allows the supervisor to make remittances immediately to the state treasurer of taxes paid under the act, and requires him to do so not later than the 30th day after the last day of the preceding quarter; in which even the right to a refund, if not sooner exercised, would be lost. Whether an aggrieved taxpayer may obtain relief under section 5 is, at best, a matter of speculation. In no view can it properly be said that there exists a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. Davis v. Wakelee, \n156 \nU.S. 680, 688\n, 15 S.Ct. 555; Union Pac. R. Co. v. Board of Com'rs of Weld County, \n247 \nU.S. 282, 285\n, 38 S.Ct. 510.\n Third. The validity of the act is assailed as violating the Federal Constitution in two particulars: (1) That it abridges the freedom of the press in contravention of the due process clause contained in section 1 of the Fourteenth \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 243]\n\u00a0\n Amendment; (2) that it denies appellees the equal protection of the laws in contravention of the same amendment.\n\n 1. \nThe first point presents a question of the utmost gravity and importance; for, if well made, it goes to the heart of the natural right of the members of an organized society, united for their common good, to impart and acquire information about their common interests. The First Amendment to the Federal Constitution provides that 'Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.' While this provision is not a restraint upon the powers of the states, the states are precluded from abridging the freedom of speech or of the press by force of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n In the case of Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516\n, 4 S.Ct. 111, this court held that the term 'due process of law' does not require presentment or indictment by a grand jury as a prerequisite to prosecution by a state for a criminal offense. And the important point of that conclusion here is that it was deduced from the fact that the Fifth Amendment, which contains the due process of law clause in its national aspect, also required an indictment as a prerequisite to a prosecution for crime under federal law; and it was thought that since no part of the amendment could be regarded as superfluous, the term 'due process of law' did not, ex vi termini, include presentment or indictment by a grand jury in any case; and that the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should be interpreted as having been used in the same sense, and as having no greater extent. But in Powell v. State of Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45, 65\n, 68 S., 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527, we held that in the light of subsequent decisions the sweeping language of the Hurtado Case could not be accepted without qualification. We concluded that certain fundamental rights, safeguarded by the first eight amendments against federal action, were also safe- \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 244]\n\u00a0\n guarded against state action by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and among them the fundamental right of the accused to the aid of counsel in a criminal prosecution.\n That freedom of speech and of the press are rights of the same fundamental character, safeguarded by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgement by state legislation, has likewise been settled by a series of decisions of this court beginning with Gitlow v. People of State of New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 666\n, 45 S.Ct. 625, and ending with Near v. State of Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 707\n, 51 S.Ct. 625. The word 'liberty' contained in that amendment embraces not only the right of a person to be free from physical restraint, but the right to be free in the enjoyment of all his faculties as well. Allgeyer v. State of Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578, 589\n, 17 S. Ct. 427.\n Appellant contends that the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to corporations; but this is only partly true. A corporation, we have held, is not a 'citizen' within the meaning of the privileges and immunities clause. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall, 168. But a corporation is a 'person' within the meaning of the equal protection and due process of law clauses, which are the clauses involved here. Covington & L. Turnpike Road Co. v. Sandford, \n164 \nU.S. 578, 592\n, 17 S.Ct. 198; Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 522\n, 18 S.Ct. 418.\n The tax imposed is designated a 'license tax for the privilege of engaging in such business,' that is to say, the business of selling, or making any charge for, advertising. As applied to appellees, it is a tax of 2 per cent. on the gross receipts derived from advertisements carried in their newspapers when, and only when, the newspapers of each enjoy a circulation of more than 20,000 copies per week. It thus operates as a restraint in a double sense. First, its effect is to curtail the amount of revenue realized from advertising; and, second, its direct \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 245]\n\u00a0\n tendency is to restrict circulation. This is plain enough when we consider that, if it were increased to a high degree, as it could be if valid ( Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40, 45\n, 54 S.Ct. 599, and cases cited), it well might result in destroying both advertising and circulation.\n A determination of the question whether the tax is valid in respect of the point now under review requires an examination of the history and circumstances which antedated and attended the adoption of the abridgement clause of the First Amendment, since that clause expresses one of those 'fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions' (Hebert v. State of Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S.Ct. 103, 104, 48 A.L.R. 1102), and, as such, is embodied in the concept 'due process of law' (Twining v. State of New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 99\n, 29 S.Ct. 14), and, therefore, protected against hostile state invasion by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. Powell v. State of Alabama, supra, \n287 U.S. 45\n, at pages 67, 68, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527. The history is a long one; but for present purposes it may be greatly abbreviated.\n For more than a century prior to the adoption of the amendment-and, indeed, for many years thereafter-history discloses a persistent effort on the part of the British government to prevent or abridge the free expression of any opinion which seemed to criticize or exhibit in an unfavorable light, however truly, the gaencies and operations of the government. The struggle between the proponents of measures to that end and those who asserted the right of free expression was continuous and unceasing. As early as 1644, John Milton, in an 'Appeal for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing,' assailed an act of Parliament which had just been passed providing for censorship of the press previous to publication. He vigorously defended the right of every man to make public his honest views 'without previous censure'; and declared the impossibility of finding any man base enough to ac- \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 246]\n\u00a0\n cept the office of censor and at the same time good enough to be allowed to perform its duties. Collett, History of the Taxes on Knowledge, vol. I, pp. 4-6. The act expired by its own terms in 1695. It was never renewed; and the liberty of the press thus became, as pointed out by Wickwar (The Struggle for the Freedom of the Press, p. 15), merely 'a right or liberty to publish without a license what formerly could be published only with one.' But mere exemption from previous censorship was soon recognized as too narrow a view of the liberty of the press.\n In 1712, in response to a message from Queen Anne (Hansard's Parliamentary History of England, vol. 6, p. 1063), Parliament imposed a tax upon all newspapers and upon advertisements. Collett, vol. I, pp. 8-10. That the main purpose of these taxes was to suppress the publication of comments and criticisms objectionable to the Crown does not admit of doubt. Stewart, Lennox and the Taxes on Knowledge, 15 Scottish Historical Review, 322-327. There followed more than a century of resistance to, and evasion of, the taxes, and of agitation for their repeal. In the article last referred to (p. 326), which was written in 1918, it was pointed out that these taxes constituted one of the factors that aroused the American colonists to protest against taxation for the purposes of the home government; and that the revolution really began when, in 1765, that government sent stamps for newspaper duties to the American colonies.\n These duties were quite commonly characterized as 'taxes on knowledge,' a phrase used for the purpose of describing the effect of the exactions and at the same time condemning them. That the taxes had, and were intended to have, the effect of curtailing the circulation of newspapers, and particularly the cheaper ones whose readers were generally found among the masses of the people, went almost without question, even on the part of \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 247]\n\u00a0\n those who defended the act. May (Constitutional History of England, 7th Ed ., vol. 2, p. 245), after discussing the control by 'previous censure,' says: '... a new restraint was devised in the form of a stamp duty on newspapers and advertisements,-avowedly for the purpose of repressing libels. This policy, being found effectual in limiting the circulation of cheap papers, was improved upon in the two following reigns, and continued in high esteem until our own time.' Collett (vol. I, p. 14), says: 'Any man who carried on printing or publishing for a livelihood was actually at the mercy of the Commissioners of Stamps, when they chose to exert their powers.'\n Citations of similar import might be multiplied many times; but the foregoing is enough to demonstrate beyond peradventure that in the adoption of the English newspaper stamp tax and the tax on advertisements, revenue was of subordinate concern; and that the dominant and controlling aim was to prevent, or curtail the opportunity for, the acquisition of knowledge by the people in respect of their governmental affairs. It is idle to suppose that so many of the best men of England would for a century of time have waged, as they did, stubborn and often precarious warfare against these taxes if a mere matter of taxation had been involved. The aim of the struggle was not to relieve taxpayers from a burden, but to establish and preserve the right of the English people to full information in respect of the doings or misdoings of their government. Upon the correctness of this conclusion the very characterization of the exactions as 'taxes on knowledge' sheds a flood of corroborative light. In the ultimate, an informed and enlightened public opinion was the thing at stake; for, as Erskine, in his great speech in defense of Paine, has said, 'The liberty of opinion keeps governments themselves in due subjection to their \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 248]\n\u00a0\n duties.' Erskine's Speeches, High's Ed., vol. I, p. 525. See May's Constitutional History of England (7th Ed.) vol. 2, pp. 238-245.\n In 1785, only four years before Congress had proposed the First Amendment, the Massachusetts Legislature, following the English example, imposed a stamp tax on all newspapers and magazines. The following year an advertisement tax was imposed. Both taxes met with such violent opposition that the former was repealed in 1786, and the latter in 1788. Duniway, Freedom of the Press in Massachusetts, pp. 136, 137.\n The framers of the First Amendment were familiar with the English struggle, which then had continued for nearly eighty years and was destined to go on for another sixty-five years, at the end of which time it culminated in a lasting abandonment of the obnoxious taxes. The framers were likewise familiar with the then recent Massachusetts episode; and while that occurrence did much to bring about the adoption of the amendment (see Pennsylvania and the Federal Constitution, 1888, p. 181), the predominant influence must have come from the English experience. It is impossible to concede that by the words 'freedom of the press' the framers of the amendment intended to adopt merely the narrow view then reflected by the law of England that such freedom consisted only in immunity from previous censorship; for this abuse had then permanently disappeared from English practice. It is equally impossible to believe that it was not intended to bring within the reach of these words such modes of restraint as were embodied in the two forms of taxation already described. Such belief must be rejected in the face of the then well-known purpose of the exactions and the general adverse sentiment of the colonies in respect of them. Undoubtedly, the range of a constitutional provision phrased in terms of the common law sometimes may be fixed by recourse to the applicable rules of that \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 249]\n\u00a0\n law. But the doctrine which justifies such recourse, like other canons of construction, must yield to more compelling reasons whenever they exist. Cf. Continental Illinois Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & P. Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 668\n, 669 S., 55 S.Ct. 595. And, obviously, it is subject to the qualification that the commonlaw rule invoked shall be one not rejected by our ancestors as unsuited to their civil or political conditions. Den ex dem. Murray v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 276, 277; Waring et al. v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 454-457; Powell v. State of Alabama, supra, \n287 U.S. 45\n, at pages 60-65, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527.\n In the light of all that has now been said, it is evident that the restricted rules of the English law in respect of the freedom of the press in force when the Constitution was adopted were never accepted by the American colonists, and that by the First Amendment it was meant to preclude the national government, and by the Fourteenth Amendment to preclude the states, from adopting any form of previous restraint upon printed publications, or their circulation, including that which had theretofore been effected by these two wellknown and odious methods.\n This court had occasion in Near v. State of Minnesota, supra, \n283 U.S. 697\n, at pages 713 et seq., 51 S.Ct. 625, to discuss at some length the subject in its general aspect. The conclusion there stated is that the object of the constitutional provisions was to prevent previous restraints on publication; and the court was careful not to limit the protection of the right to any particular way of abridging it. Liberty of the press within the meaning of the constitutional provision, it was broadly said (\n283 \nU.S. 697, 716\n, 51 S.Ct. 625, 631), meant 'principally although not exclusively, immunity from previous restraints or (from) censorship.'\n Judge Cooley has laid down the test to be applied: 'The evils to be prevented were not the censorship of the press merely, but any action of the government by \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 250]\n\u00a0\n means of which it might prevent such free and general discussion of public matters as seems absolutely essential to prepare the people for an intelligent exercise of their rights as citizens.' 2 Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) p. 886.\n It is not intended by anything we have said to suggest that the owners of newspapers are immune from any of the ordinary forms of taxation for support of the government. But this is not an ordinary form of tax, but one single in kind, with a long history of hostile misuse against the freedom of the press.\n The predominant purpose of the grant of immunity here invoked was to preserve an untrammeled press as a vital source of public information. The newspapers, magazines, and other journals of the country, it is safe to say, have shed and continue to shed, more light on the public and business affairs of the nation than any other instrumentality of publicity; and since informed public opinion is the most potent of all restraints upon misgovernment, the suppression or abridgement of the publicity afforded by a free press cannot be regarded otherwise than with grave concern. The tax here involved is bad not because it takes money from the pockets of the appellees. If that were all, a wholly different question would be presented. It is bad because, in the light of its history and of its present setting, it is seen to be a deliberate and calculated device in the guise of a tax to limit the circulation of information to which the public is entitled in virtue of the constitutional guaranties. A free press stands as one of the great interpreters between the government and the people. To allow it to be fettered is to fetter ourselves.\n In view of the persistent search for new subjects of taxation, it is not without significance that, with the single exception of the Louisian statute, so far as we can discover, no state during the one hundred fifty years of our \n\n[297 U.S. 233, 251]\n\u00a0\n national existence has undertaken to impose a tax like that now in question.\n The form in which the tax is imposed is in itself suspicious. It is not measured or limited by the volume of advertisements. It is measured alone by the extent of the circulation of the publication in which the advertisements are carried, with the plain purpose of penalizing the publishers and curtailing the circulation of a selected group of newspapers.\n\n 2. \nHaving reached the conclusion that the act imposing the tax in question is unconstitutional under the due process of law clause because it abridges the freedom of the press, we deem it unnecessary to consider the further ground assigned, that it also constitutes a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGULF REFINING CO. v.

Holt, of Charleston, W. Va., for appellee.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n These suits were brought to restrain the enforcement of a statute of West Virginia known as the 'Chain Store Tax Act,' imposing a graduated license tax upon 'stores,' which are defined as including any mercantile establishments 'which are owned, operated, maintained and\/or controlled by the same person, firm, corporation, copartnership or association.' Acts of 1933, c. 36,  8. In a companion case, this court sustained the constitutional validity of the statute and also decided that gasoline filling stations were stores or mercantile establishments within its purview. Fox v. Standard Oil Company, \n294 \nU.S. 87\n, 55 S.Ct. 333. There remained, in the instant cases, the question whether certain filling stations, particularly described, were stores belonging to, operated or controlled by the complainants, respectively.\n On the appeal to this court in the case of the Gulf Refining Company, it appeared that this question had not been determined by the District Court, and, on the reversal of its decree, the cause was remanded to the District Court that it might consider and decide that issue. Fox v. Gulf Refining Company, \n295 \nU.S. 75\n, 55 S.Ct. 641\n\n\n The question, in the case of the Gulf Refining Company, related to 568 filling stations operated under particular arrangements with 'Authorized Licensed Dealers.' These arrangements were evidenced by a lease of the premises from the dealer to the company, a license by the company to the dealer for retail sale of the company's products on the premises, a contract for sales by the company to the dealer, and various receipts for equipment and forms of riders. On considering the terms and effect of these agreements, the District Court, of three judges, \n\n[297 U.S. 381, 383]\n\u00a0\n decided that the stations were controlled by the Gulf Refining Company within the meaning of the statute. 11 F.Supp. 425.\n In the case of the Ashland Refining Company, the question related to 82 filling stations. The company conceded that by the original leases and agency agreements covering these stations the dealer was made the agent of the company and sold its products on a consignment basis. But the company contended that, before the taxing statute was enacted, the parties had abandoned that arrangement and that the company was selling its products outright to the dealers and was not exercising control over the stations. The modification of the earlier agreements was not in writing, but was shown by a stipulation of facts. The District Court considered the nature and effect of the stated modification and decided that the stations were still operated or controlled by the company within the meaning of the act. Ashland Refining Co. v. Fox, 11 F.Supp. 431.\n Appeals have been taken directly to this court. 28 U.S.C.  380 (28 U. S.C.A.  380). The questions involved are purely state questions with respect to the application of the statute to particular instances in the light of the facts disclosed.

Wilbourn and Albert S. Bozeman, both of Meridian, Miss., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Whether a federal court has jurisdiction of this suit as one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States is the single question here.\n Petitioner, plaintiff in the court below, sued the respondent in a state court in Mississippi to recover a money judgment. The following facts appear on the face of the complaint: In June, 1931, the assets of the First National Bank of Meridian, a national banking association, were conveyed to the respondent, the First National Bank in Meridian, under a contract whereby the debts and liabilities of the grantor, insolvent at the time and in the hands of a receiver, were assumed by the grantee, which covenanted to pay them. Among the debts and liabilities so assumed were moneys owing to the petitioner, the state collector of taxes, or now claimed to be owing to him, for state, county, city, and school district taxes. In form the assessment was imposed upon the shares or capital stock of the bank, its surplus and undivided profits, exclusive of the value of the real estate. In law, so the pleader states, all taxes thus assessed were debts owing by the shareholders, which the bank was under a duty to pay as their agent out of moneys belonging to them, then in its possession. \n\n[299 U.S. 109, 112]\n\u00a0\n The new bank, in violation of its covenant, failed to pay the taxes of the old bank, which it had thus assumed and made its own. Judgment is demanded for the moneys due under the contract.\n A petition was filed by the respondent for the removal of the cause to the federal court upon the ground that the suit was one arising 'under the Constitution or laws of the United States.' Judicial Code  28, 28 U.S. C.  71 (28 U.S.C.A.  71). Cf. Judicial Code  24(1)(a), 28 U.S.C.  41(1)( a), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1)(a). The state court made an order accordingly, and the federal District Court denied a motion to remand. Later, after a trial upon the merits, the complaint was dismissed. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment of dismissal, overruling the objection that the cause was one triable in the courts of Mississippi. 81 F.(2d) 502. The decision was put upon the ground that the power to lay a tax upon the shares of national banks has its origin and measure in the provisions of a federal statute (R.S.  5219, as amended, 12 U.S.C.  548, 12 U.S.C.A.  548), and that by necessary implication a plaintiff counts upon the statute in suing for the tax. Because of the importance of the ruling, this Court granted certiorari, 'limited to the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court.' \n298 \nU.S. 650\n, 56 S.Ct. 939. 80 L.Ed. 1393\n\n\n How and when a case arises 'under the Constitution or laws of the United States' has been much considered in the books. Some tests are well established. To bring a case within the statute, a right or immunity created by the Constitution or laws of the United States must be an element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff's cause of action. Starin v. New York, \n115 \nU.S. 248, 257\n, 6 S.Ct. 28; First National Bank v. Williams, \n252 \nU.S. 504, 512\n, 40 S.Ct. 372, 374. The right or immunity must be such that it will be supported if the Constitution or laws of the United States are given one construction or effect, and defeated if they receive another.

A genuine and present controversy, not merely a possible or conjectural one, must exist with reference thereto (New Orleans v. Benjamin, \n153 \nU.S. 411, 424\n, 14 S.Ct. 905; Defiance Water Co. v.

New York Trust Co., \n229 \nU.S. 123, 133\n, 33 S.Ct. 657), and the controversy must be disclosed upon the face of the complaint, unaided by the answer or by the petition for removal. (Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, \n152 \nU.S. 454\n, 14 S.Ct. 654; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, \n211 \nU.S. 149\n, 29 S.Ct. 42; The Fair v.

Indeed, the complaint itself will not avail as a basis of jurisdiction in so far as it goes beyond a statement of the plaintiff's cause of action and anticipates or replies to a probable defense. Devine v. Los Angeles, \n202 \nU.S. 313, 334\n, 26 S.Ct. 652; The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co., supra.\n Looking backward we can see that the early cases were less exacting than the recent ones in respect of some of these conditions. If a federal right was pleaded, the question was not always asked whether it was likely to be disputed. This is seen particularly in suits by or against a corporation deriving its charter from an act of Congress. Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 817-828; Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 5 S.Ct. 1113. Modern statutes have greatly diminished the importance of those decisions by narrowing their scope. Gay v. Ruff, \n292 \nU.S. 25, 35\n, 54 S.Ct. 608, 613, 92 A.L.R. 970; Puerto Rico v.

Partly under the influence of statutes disclosing a new legislative policy, partly under the influence of more liberal decisions, the probable course \n\n[299 U.S. 109, 114]\n\u00a0\n of the trial, the real substance of the controversy, has taken on a new significance. 'A suit to enforce a right which takes its origin in the laws of the United States is not necessarily, or for that reason alone, one arising under those laws, for a suit does not so arise unless it really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction, or effect of such a law, upon the determination of which the result depends.' Shulthis v. McDougal, \n225 \nU.S. 561, 569\n, 32 S. Ct. 704, 706. Cf. First National Bank v. Williams, supra; Hopkins v. Walker, \n244 \nU.S. 486, 489\n, 37 S.Ct. 711; Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, \n177 \nU.S. 505, 507\n, 20 S.Ct. 726. Only recently we said after full consideration that the doctrine of the charter cases was to be treated as exceptional, though within their special field there was no thought to disturb them. Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co., supra. 'We should fly in the face of this legislative policy and disregard precedents which we think controlling were we to extend the doctrine now.' Id. Today, even more clearly than in the past, 'the federal nature of the right to be established is decisive-not the source of the authority to establish it.' Id.\n Viewing the case at hand against this background of established principle, we do not find in it the elements of federal jurisdiction.\n\n 1. \nThe suit is built upon a contract which in point of obligation has its genesis in the law of Mississippi. A covenant for a valuable consideration to pay another's debts is valid and enforceable without reference to a federal law. For all that the complaint informs us, the failure to make payment was owing to lack of funds or to a belief that a stranger to the contract had no standing as a suitor or to other objections nonfederal in their nature. There is no necessary connection between the enforcement of such a contract according to its terms and the existence of a controversy arising under federal law. \n\n[299 U.S. 109, 115]\n\u00a0\n 2. The obligation of the contract being a creation of the state, the question remains whether the plaintiff counts upon a federal right in support of his claim that the contract has been broken. The performance owing by the defendant was payment of the valid debts, and taxes are not valid debts unless lawfully imposed. From this defendant argues that a federal controversy exists, the tax being laid upon a national bank or upon the shareholders therein, and for that reason being void unless permitted by the federal law.\n Not every question of federal law emerging in a suit is proof that a federal law is the basis of the suit. The tax here in controversy, if valid as a tax at all, was imposed under the authority of a statute of Mississippi. The federal law did not attempt to impose it or to confer upon the tax collector authority to sue for it. True, the tax, though assessed through the action of the state, must be consistent with the federal statute consenting, subject to restrictions, that such assessments may be made. R.S.  5219, as amended, 12 U.S.C.  548 (12 U.S.C.A.  548). It must also be consistent with the Constitution of the United States. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 \nU.S. 664\n, 19 S.Ct. 537; Baltimore National Bank v. State Tax Commission, \n297 \nU.S. 209\n, 56 S.Ct. 417. If there were no federal law permitting the taxation of shares in national banks, a suit to recover such a tax would not be one arising under the Constitution of the United States, though the bank would have the aid of the Constitution when it came to its defense. Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, supra; Sawyer v. Kochersperger, \n170 \nU.S. 303\n, 18 S.Ct. 946; Arkansas v. Kansas & Texas Coal Co., \n183 \nU.S. 185\n, 22 S.Ct. 47; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, supra. That there is a federal law permitting such taxation does not change the basis of the suit, which is still the statute of the state, though the federal law is evidence to prove the statute valid. \n\n[299 U.S. 109, 116]\n\u00a0\n The argument for the respondent proceeds on the assumption that, because permission at times is preliminary to action, the two are to be classed as one. But the assumption will not stand. A suit does not arise under a law renouncing a defense, though the result of the renunciation is an extension of the area of legislative power which will cause the suitor to prevail. Let us suppose an amendment of the Constitution by which the states are left at liberty to levy taxes on the income derived from federal securities, or to lay imposts and duties at their pleasure upon imports and exports. If such an amendment were adopted, a suit to recover taxes or duties imposed by the state law would not be one arising under the Constitution of the United States, though in the absence of the amendment the duty or the tax would fail. We recur to the test announced in Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co., supra: 'The federal nature of the right to be established is decisive-not the source of the authority to establish it.' Here the right to be established is one created by the state. If that is so, it is unimportant that federal consent is the source of state authority. To reach the underlying law we do not travel back so far. By unimpeachable authority, a suit brought upon a state statute does not arise under an act of Congress or the Constitution of the United States because prohibited thereby. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, supra. With no greater reason can it be said to arise thereunder because permitted thereby.\n Another line of reasoning will lead us to the same conclusion. The Mississippi law provides, in harmony with the act of Congress (R.S.  5219 ), that a tax upon the shares of national banks shall be assessed upon the shareholders, though the bank may be liable to pay it as their agent, charging their account with moneys thus ex- \n\n[299 U.S. 109, 117]\n\u00a0\n pended. Code of Mississippi,  3138. Cf. Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 518\n, 27 S.Ct. 571; Aberdeen Bank v. Chehalis County, \n166 \nU.S. 440\n, 17 S.Ct. 629; First National Bank v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353. Petitioner will have to prove that the state law has been obeyed before the question will be reached whether anything in its provisions or in administrative conduct under it is inconsistent with the federal rule. If what was done by the taxing officers in levying the tax in suit did not amount in substance under the law of Mississippi to an assessment of the shareholders, but in substance as well as in form was an assessment of the bank alone, the conclusion will be inescapable that there was neither tax nor debt, apart from any barriers that Congress may have built. On the other hand, a finding upon evidence that the Mississippi law has been obeyed may compose the controversy altogether, leaving no room for a contention that the federal law has been infringed. The most one can say is that a question of federal law is lurking in the background, just as farther in the background there lurks a question of constitutional law, the question of state power in our federal form of government. A dispute so doubtful and conjectural, to far removed from plain necessity, is unavailable to extinguish the jurisdiction of the states.\n This Court has had occasion to point out how futile is the attempt to define a 'cause of action' without reference to the context. United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 62, 67\n, 68 S., 53 S.Ct. 278, 280. To define broadly and in the abstract 'a case arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States' has hazards of a kindred order. What is needed is something of that common-sense accommodation of judgment to kaleidoscopic situations which characterizes the law in its treatment of problems of causation. One could carry the search for causes backward, almost without end. Bird v. St. Paul, F. & M. In- \n\n[299 U.S. 109, 118]\n\u00a0\n surance Co., 224 N.Y. 47, 51, 120 N.E. 86, 13 A.L.R. 875; Leyland Shipping Co. v. Norwich Fire Insurance Society, (1918) A.C. 350, 369; AEtna Insurance Co. v. Boon, \n95 U.S. 117\n, 130; Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, \n94 U.S. 469\n, 474. Instead, there has been a selective process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside. As in problems of causation, so here in the search for the underlying law. If we follow the ascent far enough, countless claims of right can be discovered to have their source or their operative limits in the provisions of a federal statute or in the Constitution itself with its circumambient restrictions upon legislative power. To set bounds to the pursuit, the courts have formulated the distinction between controversies that are basic and those that are collateral, between disputes that are necessary and those that are merely possible. We shall be lost in a maze if we put that compass by.\n The judgment should be reversed and the cause remitted to the District Court, with instructions to remand it to the court in Mississippi from which it was removed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHART v.

Staples, of Roanoke, Va., for appellant.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Appellant, a convict, was convicted of the felonious killing of one Alton Leonard, a prison guard, in whose custody appellant was working. The jury fixed his punishment at death. The conviction and sentence were pursuant to sections 5049 and 5051 of the Virginia Code 1930, providing, so far as pertinent, as follows:\n's 5049. A convict confined in the penitentiary, or in custody of an officer thereof, shall be deemed guilty of felony if he kill, wound, or inflict other bodily injury upon an officer or guard of the penitentiary.'\n\n's 5051. A convict guilty of such killing as is mentioned in section five thousand and forty-nine, or of any act therein mentioned, from which death ensues to such officer or guard, shall be punished with death.'\n\n Appellant challenged these provisions as being repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses \n\n[298 U.S. 34, 35]\n\u00a0\n of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. His main contentions were that the statute was so broad as to embrace excusable homicide and that, as a convict, he was deprived of the equal protection of the laws relating to murder and manslaughter.\n We take the statute as construed by the state court and applied in the instant case. Appellant defended the killing of Leonard upon the ground of self-defense. The evidence in support of that defense, with all the circumstances of the case, was submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions which recognized the admissibility of the defense under the statute. The trial court, defining with care the right of self-defense, charged the jury that if appellant had acted in the exercise of that right, the jury should find him not guilty. The Supreme Court of Appeals refused to review the judgment upon the ground that it was 'plainly right.'\n As we find no substantial federal question presented, the appeal is dismissed for the want of jurisdiction.

Dammann, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An Illinois statute1 forbids persons, associations, and corporations to receive, sell, offer, or solicit consignments of farm produce for sale, on commission, within Illinois, unless licensed; requires an applicant for a license to make a showing as to character, responsibility, and good faith in the conduct of the proposed business; and directs that a license must be procured for each location where the business is to be transacted, a fee paid therefor, and a bond, in the sum of $5,000, with satisfactory surety, executed, conditioned on honest accounting and handling of produce received and against fraudulent conduct. Provision is made for the granting and revocation of licenses \n\n[298 U.S. 155, 157]\n\u00a0\n by the Director of Agriculture. A licensee is required to follow certain business methods, to keep records, which are to be subject to inspection, to account and to pay for produce received for sale. The Director is empowered to bring action upon the licensee's bond for the recovery of sums due consignors for goods sold, if payment is not made by the licensee, or for the recovery of damages suffered by consignors as a result of fraudulent acts or wrongful handling on the part of the licensee. Should the penalty of the bond prove insufficient to pay all such liabilities, the consignors are to receive payment of any amount recovered in proportion to their serveral claims.\n The Cross Company took licenses, and the appellant became surety on its bonds, for the years ending July 1, 1932, and July 1, 1933. In October, 1932, the Cross Company became bankrupt and failed to account for numerous consignments of fresh fruits and vegetables. Some were shipped from Illinois, but most were from other states. The Director of Agriculture brought actions in a state court on both bonds. The court consolidated the cases and they were tried together on stipulated facts.\n The appellant, in addition to defenses raising no federal question, pleaded that the statute was beyond the state's power because a restriction upon, and a regulation of, interstate commerce. Judgment was entered against the Cross Company and the appellant. Both appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, which affirmed the judgment. \n2\n The appellant summoned and severed the Cross Company and prosecuted an appeal to this court.\n The sole question presented is the constitutional validity of the act as it affects the appellant's liability under its bonds. The statute is a police regulation. The business regulated is local, having its situs within the state \n\n[298 U.S. 155, 158]\n\u00a0\n and being conducted therein. The fact that the commission merchant contracts to sell, and sells, farm produce forwarded to him from points without, as well as points within, the state is not enough to condemn the regulation of a business carried on within her borders. \n3\n Such effect as the regulation has upon interstate commerce is indirect and incidental and does not trespass upon the power conferred on Congress by article 1,  8, of the Federal Constitution. In these circumstances, until Congress, under the commerce power, adopts inconsistent legislation, that of the state remains effective. \n 4\n\u00a0\n\n The appellant urges, however, that Congress has adopted an act5 regulating the same business and the Cross Company was required to take a license under that act. This alone is not sufficient to nullify the state law, if the federal act does not cover the same field, or is consistent with it. \n6\n But it is said the state and federal laws are similar in their provisions and, therefore, the exercise by Congress of its paramount power nullifies the state statute. The federal act requires every person, partnership, association, or corporation, who is engaged in the business of receiving in interstate or foreign commerce perishable agricultural commodities, defined as 'fresh fruits and vegetables of every kind and character,' for sale on commission, to procure a license from the Secre- \n\n[298 U.S. 155, 159]\n\u00a0\n tary of Agriculture. The act parallels the state statute in respect of the requirements of proper accounting, honest dealing, and prompt remittance. While it provides for awards of reparation by the Secretary of Agriculture for noncompliance with its prescriptions, gives a right of action to consignors and shippers for violation of its provisions, authorizes the revocation of licenses and imposes penalties, thus covering to some extent the same ground as the state law, it does not call for the giving of any bond by a licensee. Moreover, section 15(7 U.S.C.A.  499o)r1936123248;;; ST;15(7USCAS499o;;r provides: 'This Act (chapter) shall not abrogate nor nullify any other statute, whether State of Federal, dealing with the same subjects as this act (chapter); but it is intended that all such statutes shall remain in full force and effect except in so far only as they are inconsistent herewith or repugnant hereto.'\n Thus the act of Congress not only omits the requirement of a bond, but affirmatively saves the provision of the Illinois act as to that form of security. As respects the bond and the protection thereby afforded to consignors, there is no inconsistency between the two acts, and both may be given effect.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Smith-Hurd Ann.St.Ill. c. 5,  17-24, Cahill's Ill.Rev.Stat. c. 5 ,  24-32. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] People v.

Curtin, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents in these two causes were partners as Albert Fried & Co., brokers, member of the New York Stock Exchange, with offices at 120 Broadway. When he undertook to determine their individual taxable profits during 1931, the Commissioner denied their claim that the firm's operations on the Exchange as a 'Specialist' in thirteen stocks gave it the status of dealer therein, entitled to the privilege of inventorying such securities for tax purposes at market value under Article 105, Treasury Regulations 74, Revenue Act 1928. \n\n[299 U.S. 175, 176]\n\u00a0\n Upon stipulated facts the Board of Tax Appeals, although sharply divided, sustained his action. The court below held the firm was a dealer within the Regulations, regarded Commissioner v. Stevens (C.C.A.) 78 F.(2d) 713, as controlling, and reversed the Board's decision. Certiorari was granted here (\n299 \nU.S. 529\n, 57 S.Ct. 25, 81 L.Ed. --) upon the Commissioner's petition, which affirms that the question presented is 'Whether the respondents were dealers in certain securities in which they specialized so as to entitle them to inventory the securities at market value in determining income.'\n Pertinent provisions of the Revenue Act and Treasury Regulations are set out in the opinion in Algernon S. Schafer et al. v. Helvering, Commissioner, \n299 \nU.S. 171\n, 57 S.Ct. 148, this day announced.\n The stipulated facts show:\n Alfred Fried and Benjamin Einhorn composed the firm, Alfred Fried & Co., 120 Broadway, organized in 1929, and member of New York Stock Exchange. It is a 'Specialist' in thirteen specified stocks there bought and sold. A 'Specialist' is a qualified member who accepts orders in selected securities from other members for execution.\n As such 'Specialist' the firm filled orders either by buying or selling its own securities or by matching like orders of buyer and seller. It leased space on the Exchange floor at an annual rental of $2,000, and there carried on business in the thirteen stocks. The firm was known to all members as a 'Specialist,' and was regularly and consistently engaged in purchases and resales. It is the practice for a member who desires to buy or sell a stock to place his order with the 'Specialist' therein. The firm always had on hand the securities in which it specialized. The number ( from 10,300 to 62,300) of shares of these owned by the firm at the end of each month in the year under review is stated. In one month-an example-of the 126,200 shares Air Reduction stock sold on the Exchange, 59 per cent. was sold by Fried & Co. \n\n[299 U.S. 175, 177]\n\u00a0\n All stocks bought and sold by the firm were actually received and delivered. During the tax year it sold 1,762,100 shares of the thirteen stocks. Of other stocks it sold 119,600 shares.\n Since its inception, the firm has regularly inventoried unsold securities at the market and computed tax liability on that basis. On numerous occasions it purchased and sold in order to maintain fair and equitable markets and, as far as possible, has tried to prevent wide fluctuation in prices. During the year the partnership sold to 431 customers in amounts ranging from 100 to 5,700 shares. These customers were other members of the Stock Exchange acting for themselves or their principals.\n We think the facts stipulated adequately establish that Fried & Co. had an established place of business; that it regularly engaged in the purchase of certain specified securities and their resale to customers; that as a merchant it bought securities and sold them to customers with a view to the gains and profits that might be derived therefrom. Also that the evidence afforded no adequate basis for a contrary finding by the Board of Tax Appeals.\n The Board's conclusion was announced (1934) prior to the decision ( 1935) of Commissioner v. Stevens, supra. In that cause, also in Vaughan v. Commissioner, 85 F.(2d) 497, the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, describes the activities of 'Specialists' on the Stock Exchange and concludes that they are dealers or merchants, in respect of the securities wherein they specialize, entitled to the benefit of Article 105 of Treasury Regulations 74.\n We accept the conclusions reached below and need not repeat the adequate arguments advanced to support them.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v.

The Board of Tax Appeals held the deduction rightly taken. Illinois Life Ins Co. v. Com'r of Internal Revenue, 30 B.T.A. 1160, 1162. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 80 F.(2d) 280. Upon on petitioner's insistence that the decision below conflicts with Helvering v. Insurance Co., \n294 \nU.S. 686\n, 55 S.Ct. 572, we granted this writ.\n The case involves a construction of a clause of section 203(a)(2), Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 842 (26 U.S.C.A.  203 note), which declares that, in case of a life insurance company, net income means gross income less, among other permissible deductions, an amount equal to 4 per cent. of the mean of the reserve funds required by law and held at the beginning and end of the taxable year. That provision is a re-enactment of section 245(a)(2), Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 261, which in Helvering v. Insurance Co. v. held not to apply to assets reserved by a life insurance company against matured, unsurrendered, and unpaid coupons attached to its policies. That decision rests upon the ground that the reserves in respect of the coupon liability were not essentially insurance reserves which alone constitute the base on which deduction is computed. The question now for decision is whether respondent's assets reserved in 1929 in respect of its survivorship investment funds are included in that base.\n The reserves in question conveniently may be described by reference to a typical policy. Applicable to age 35, it contains the company's agreement, upon death of the insured, to pay $10,000 to the beneficiary; the annual premium is $379.90, payable for 20 years. The company also agrees that, out of each year's premium after the first, $64.60 will be placed in the survivorship investment fund applicable to policies on the survivorship investment plan issued in the same calendar year; that no \n\n[299 U.S. 622, 90]\n\u00a0\n deduction shall be made from the fund; that all contributions to it shall be accumulated at 3 1\/2 per cent. compound interest; that, if the insured shall survive the twentieth anniversary of the policy, the company will apportion to the policy as a survivorship investment a sum bearing the same proportion to the total in the fund as the contributions from premiums paid on that policy bear to the aggregate contributions from premiums paid on all policies in the same class in force at the end of 20 years. Thus, the entire fund is divided among the persistent surviving contributors. The policy provides for optional settlements at the end of 20 years: (A) The insured may continue the policy as one fully paid up and in addition receive either cash payment of the survivorship investment apportioned to it or, if then insurable, a fully paid up life insurance policy for such amount as would be purchased by the survivorship investment. (B) The insured may surrender the policy and receive payment of the cash value, $6,100, and in addition the survivorship investment.\n The mean of petitioner's liabilities in respect of the survivorship investment funds at the beginning and end of 1929 was.$3,343,982.67, 4 per cent. of which is the item in controversy.\n The phrase 'required by law' includes only reserves that directly pertain to life insurance. Other reserves, even though required by state statutes regulatory of the business authorized to be carried on by life insurance companies, are not included. Under these policies the company's liabilities on account of the investment funds are independent of those attributable to life insurance risks. The right to participate in the investment funds is not dependent upon death of the insured. The company's liability is the total of contributions to the fund plus the interest agreed to be paid. It is bound to dis- \n\n[299 U.S. 622, 91]\n\u00a0\n charge this liability at the end of 20 years. Its life insurance liability arises upon the death of the insured. Ascertainment of the reserves attributable to that liability involves consideration of the amount contributed to them out of premiums plus interest for a period estimated on the basis of mortality. \n1\n The survivorship investment fund feature of these policies has no relation to life insurance risks. Under our decision in Helvering v.

Gen., of Washington, D.C., for Helvering.\n Mr. John G. Jackson, of New York City, for Salvage. \n\n[297 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cross-writs bring up a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, which disapproved a deficiency assessment for 1929 income, and authorized recovery for overpayment below the taxpayer's claim.\n The petition for certiorari in No. 173 asserts: 'The question is- Whether the taxpayer is estopped to claim that the difference between the market value of the 1,500 shares as of December 30, 1922 and their cost to him constituted taxable income to him for 1922; and hence that the fair market value of these shares, and not their cost, is the basis to be used in measuring the gain from the disposition of the shares in 1929, no income from the transaction having been reported in 1922.'\n The points to be urged in No. 280 are stated thus: 'The Circuit Court of Appeals erred: (1) In holding that the cost base of the preferred stock of American Viscose Corporation redeemed in 1929 was to be arrived at by taking as the fair market value of the Viscose Company stock the sum of $ 100 per share, insofar as the five-sevenths of said stock which was subject to the option to repurchase was concerned. (2) In making a finding as to the value of said optioned stock.'\n Prior to 1922, Salvage, the taxpayer, bought 25 shares Viscose Company stock. He paid $166.66 for each one; for all $4,166.66. In December, 1922, he acquired from the corporation 1,500 shares for which he paid $100 per share ($150,000) and entered into an obligation to refrain from competing business, etc. Also, he agreed that during 1923 the corporation might repurchase five-sevenths of 1,500 shares at par; during 1924, four-sevenths, etc. Intrinsically (when unincumbered) a share of the company stock was then worth $1,164.70.\n Later, during 1922, all these shares (1,525) were exchanged for 6,100 preferred shares, redeemable at $110, \n\n[297 U.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n and 7,625 common shares, American Viscose Corporation. The basis of exchange was four preferred and five common shares of new stock for one share of old. The taxpayer's return for 1922 (not in evidence) showed no gain from these transactions.\n During 1929, American Viscose Corporation redeemed its preferred shares at $110; Salvage received $671,000. His return for that year disclosed as net capital gain the difference between that sum and $154,166. 66, total outlay for the 1525 converted shares. Upon this, he paid the assessed tax. Apparently, he supposed apportionment between preferred and common stock of their total cost was impossible or unnecessary; also, that no taxable gain arose before return of his entire outlay.\n Upon an audit, the Commissioner ruled that proper apportionment of the total cost, $154,166.66, could be made. He assigned 37 per cent. to the preferred and 62 per cent. to the common shares and made a dificiency assessment of $12,005.38. Thereupon, the taxpayer claimed: First, that in 1922 each Viscose Company share was fairly worth $1,164.70, and, with that as the base, no taxable gain arose upon redemption of the preferred stock. Also, that he had overpaid to the extent of $63,750. Second, that apportionment of the cost of both between preferred and common shares was impracticable and no taxable gain could arise prior to recovery of the full outlay.\n Upon these conflicting claims, the Board of Tax Appeals took the matter. There the Commissioner asserted correctness of his action; he presented no affirmative defense; set up no claim of estoppel because of the taxpayer's failure properly to report 1922 gain.\n The Board held the difference between the true value of Viscose Company shares and the price paid by the taxpayer was not compensation for services; also, that the \n\n[297 U.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n dificiency assessment was properly made. Estoppel was neither presented nor considered.\n The court below held that the consideration for the Viscose Company stock acquired in 1922 was $100 per share, plus the covenants to resell five-sevenths at par, etc., and not o engage in competing business. Also, that the base cost for estimating capital gain in 1929 was the fair market value in 1922 of the shares then held. And since the corporation had the right to repurchase at par, the market value of five-sevenths did not exceed $100 per share. Further, that the failure to disclose 1922 taxable gain apparently resulted from innocent mistake of law; there was no false representation of fact; nothing gave support to the claim of estoppel. The cause was remanded for ascertainment of the amount of the overpayment.\n We find no reason to disagree with the judgment of the court.\n The defense of estoppel was not before the Board. Under what we regard as the correct practice, General Utilities & Operating Co. v. Helvering, \n296 \nU.S. 200\n, 56 S.Ct. 185, decided December 9, 1935, the court should have passed the point. Furthermore, the facts disclosed give it no support.\n Considering the option to repurchase at par, outstanding in 1922, there could be no proper finding of fair market value at that time in excess of $100 per share. In the circumstances, the court did not err in so holding.\n Pertinent Treasury regulations, rulings, and judicial opinions are adequately pointed out by the court's opinion.\n The judgment is affirmed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v.

The ques-\n * Rehearing denied \n297 \nU.S. 728\n, 56 S.Ct. 666. \n\n[297 U.S. 496, 497]\n\u00a0\n tion is presented under the relevant sections of the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, 1926, and 1928.1\n October 13, 1906, the Irvine Company leased to the San Joaquin Fruit Company one thousand acres, part of a much larger tract, of bare unirrigated land in California. The lessor was wholly owned by one Irvine, and the lessee was organized by two experienced men who together with Irvine subscribed its capital, in the hope that planting, irrigation, and cultivation would make the land valuable. The lease was for a term of ten years from December 1, 1906; required the lessee to plant the tract as an orchard within four years, to procure and conduct a specified supply of irrigation water to the tract, and to raise certain field crops in connection with the orchard; and embodied an irrevocable option to buy the whole acreage for $200,000, exercisable November 30, 1916. Before October, 1908, the lessee procured the water, planted, and was successfully working the land; and the taking up of the option at the end of the term was then no longer a matter of doubt. By February 28, 1913, the value of the property had greatly increased. On November 30, 1916, the option was closed and conveyance made to the lessee, which subsequently transferred the land to the respondent under circumstances which do not alter the basis for calculation of gain. During the period 1920 to 1928, in- \n\n[297 U.S. 496, 498]\n\u00a0\n clusive, the respondent sold portions of the tract. In computing the tax liability for these years the petitioner determined the property was acquired November 30, 1916, when the option was exercised, and its cost was the $200,000 paid plus the amounts expended for improvements pursuant to the lease. The respondent appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, contending the lessee acquired a property in the land-an interest real- prior to March 1, 1913, and the value of the land at that date was the proper basis for calculating gain on sales. The Board sustained the petitioner. \n2\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board's decision. \n3\n To resolve an asserted conflict4 we granted certiorari. \n296 \nU.S. 561\n, 56 S. Ct. 141.\n We hold that the respondent acquired the property on November 30, 1916. The option itself was property, and doubtless was valuable. If it had been assignable, and the lessee had sold it at a profit, taxable gain would have resulted from the sale. But the option is admittedly not the same property as the land. So conceding, the respondent still insists that ownership of the option created an interest in the land. This would not be true of a bare option unconnected with a lease;5 but we are told that because embodied in the lease the agreement became a covenant real and gave the lessee a species of interest or property in the land. The weight of authority is to the contrary, 6 and no cited California decision \n\n[297 U.S. 496, 499]\n\u00a0\n supports the position. \n7\n But even if we should agree that a lessee-optionee acquires, by virtue of the instrument, an equitable interest in the land it would not follow that, within the contemplation of the revenue acts, he acquires the property at the date of the option rather than at the date of conveyance. The word 'acquired' is not a term of art in the law of property but one in common use. The plain import of the word is 'obtained as one's own'. Language used in tax statutes should be read in the ordinary and natural sense. \n8\n In the common and usual meaning of the term the land was acquired when conveyed to the respondent's predecessor.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals thought that to avoid serious doubts concerning the constitutional power to tax gains accruing before March 1, 1913, it was important, if possible, to treat the property as acquired when the option was given. The court therefore resorted to the doctrine that the title when acquired relates back to the date of the option. Cited in support of this application of the theory are cases in which the California courts have invoked it to subordinate the rights of assignees or mortgagees who became such with notice of an outstanding option. \n9\n The fiction of relation, indulged to defeat those dealing with the legal title with knowledge of the option, can give no aid in solving the question of the time of the optionee's acquirement of property under a statute taxing gain upon a subsequent sale. And there is no need of the fiction to avoid any constitutional question. The power to tax gains which accrued prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment is not here involved. We suppose \n\n[297 U.S. 496, 500]\n\u00a0\n the amount received by the respondent from a sale includes and is the result of increase in value of the property in the period prior to March 1, 1913. But the gain accruing in that period did not accrue to property owned by the lessee. Neither the land nor the gain so accruing before March 1, 1913, became the lessee's property until 1916 when it took up the option.\n An alternative contention is that the exercise of the option and the conveyance on November 30, 1916, constituted merely an exchange of capital assets-a closed transaction-and the basis for calculation of gain was the value of the land and improvements at that date. The capital asset, sale of which resulted in taxable gain, was the land. This was not an asset of the taxpayer prior to the exercise of the option. We think it clear that there was no combination of two capital assets (the option and $200,000 of cash), to form a new capital asset (the land), which was subsequently sold at a profit. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 42 Stat. 227, 229,  202(a, b); 43 Stat. 253, 258,  204 (a, b); 44 Stat. 9, 14,  204(a, b), 26 U.S.C.A.  113 note; 45 Stat. 791, 818,  113( a, b), 26 U.S.C.A.  113(a, b).

Wampler.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an indictment in two counts the relator Wampler was charged with an attempt to evade and defeat the payment of his income tax under the laws of the United States through the filing in the years 1930 and 1931 of false and fraudulent returns. He was convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. On December 28, 1933, the judgment of the court was pronounced as follows: 'Fine five thousand dollars and eighteen months in penitentiary on each count of the indictment, said terms of imprisonment to be computed as beginning this 28th day of December 1933; fines to be cumulative and terms of imprisonment to run concurrently and that traverser pay costs of proceedings.' On the same day the clerk of the court issued and forwarded to the United States Northeastern Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa., a commitment in which the judgment was set out as follows: 'That the traverser pay a fine of Five Thousand Dollars and be imprisoned in the United States Northeastern Penitentiary at Lewis- \n\n[298 U.S. 460, 462]\n\u00a0\n burg, Pennsylvania, for eighteen months on each count of the indictment; said term of imprisonment to be computed as beginning this 28th day of December 1933; the fines to be cumulative and the terms of imprisonment to run concurrently; and that the traverser pay the costs of prosecution; and in default of payment of said fines and costs, he stand further committed until the payment of said fines and costs or until discharged by due process of law.'\n On April 21, 1935, when the term of eighteen months was approaching an end, Wampler filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland a petition directed to the judge of that court in which he alleged that the court had not adjudged or ordered that he was to stand committed until the payment of the fine and costs; that this provision had been inserted in the commitment by the clerk; and that it was no part of the sentence. He prayed for an order amending the commitment by striking therefrom the words so added.\n On April 25, 1935, the petition for amendment was denied, the judge filing an opinion in which he pointed out that Maryland is a common law state; that the practice in the state courts is not to include in the judgment of the court the express direction that the defendant stand committed until the fines are paid; that it has always been the practice in the District Court for the District of Maryland to follow the procedure in the state court, but that the clerk of the court has instructions from the court to include in the commitment the express provision that the defendant stand committed until the fines are paid, unless otherwise directed.* There was no appeal from that decision.\n On July 23, 1935, the relator filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that the \n\n[298 U.S. 460, 463]\n\u00a0\n proper term of his imprisonment had expired and that his detention had become unlawful. The petition was granted, and the relator discharged. Wampler v. Hill, 11 F.Supp. 540. The warden of the penitentiary appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. That court, after certifying the facts substantially as summarized above, requested our instructions upon the following questions (Judicial Code,  239, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  346 (28 U.S.C.A.  346)):\n'1. Was the provision in the commitment for imprisonment for nonpayment of fine and costs which was inserted by the Clerk but not included in the sentence orally pronounced by the judge, (a) void? or (b) merely irregular?\n\n'2. Was the determination of the District Court on the petition to correct the commitment, a final judgment conclusive on the issue as to the validity of such commitment until reversed by appropriate proceedings for review?\n\n'3. Will haheas corpus lie in one court to correct the commitment of another court which certainly, definitely, and specifically directs the imprisonment of relator for nonpayment of fine and costs on the ground that such provision was inserted by the Clerk, but was not the sentence orally pronounced by the court?'\n\n The payment of a fine imposed by a court of the United States in a criminal prosecution may be enforced by execution against property in like manner as in civil cases. R.S.  1041, 18 U.S.C.  569 (18 U.S.C.A.  569). In the discretion of the court the judgment may direct also that the defendant shall be imprisoned until the fine is paid. Ibid.; and see R.S.  1042, 18 U.S.C.  641 (18 U.S.C.A.  641). Ex parte Jackson, \n96 U.S. 727\n, 737; Ex parte Barclay (C.C.) 153 F. 669; Haddox v. Richardson (C.C.A.) 168 F. 635, 639. If the direction for imprisonment is omitted, the remedy by execution is exclusive. Imprisonment does not follow automatically upon a showing of default in payment. It follows, if at all, \n\n[298 U.S. 460, 464]\n\u00a0\n because the consequence has been prescribed in the imposition of the sentence. The choice of pains and penalties, when choice is committed to the discretion of the court, is part of the judicial function. This being so, it must have expression in the sentence, and the sentence is the judgment. Miller v. Aderhold, \n288 \nU.S. 206, 210\n, 53 S.Ct. 325; Wagner v. United States (C.C.A.) 3 F.(2d) 864; State v. Vaughan, 71 Conn. 457, 458, 42 A. 640; Manke v. People, 74 N.Y. 415, 424.\n Two of the questions certified to us, the first question and the third, make mention of a variance between the commitment and the sentence 'orally pronounced.' If that were the only variance, we should deem it unimportant. The only sentence known to the law is the sentence or judgment entered upon the records of the court. Miller v. Aderhold, supra; Wagner v. United States, supra; Manke v. People, supra. If the entry is inaccurate, there is a remedy by motion to correct it to the end that it may speak the truth. People ex rel. Trainor v. Baker, 89 N.Y. 460, 466. But the judgment imports verity when collaterally assailed. Ibid. Until corrected in a direct proceeding, it says what it was meant to say, and this by an irrebuttable presumption. In any collateral inquiry, a court will close its ears to a suggestion that the sentence entered in the minutes is something other than the authentic expression of the sentence of the judge.\n The questions are to be read, however, in the light of the preliminary statement certifying the facts out of which the questions have arisen. Rule 37, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354; Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399, 422\n, 34 S.Ct. 136; Dillon v. Strathearn S.S. Co., \n248 \nU.S. 182, 184\n, 39 S.Ct. 83. From that certificate it is clear that the sentence spread upon the records is identical with the sentence orally pronounced and that the only variance complained of is between sentence and commitment.** In such circumstances the \n\n[298 U.S. 460, 465]\n\u00a0\n word 'orally' in questions 1 and 3 may be disregarded as superfluous, and the answers to the questions made as we would make them if the word had been omitted.\n A warrant of commitment departing in matter of substance from the judgment back of it is void. Boyd v. Archer (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 43, 70 A.L. R. 1507; Wagner v. United States, supra. Being void and not merely irregular, its nullity may be established upon a writ of habeas corpus. People ex rel. Trainor v. Baker, supra; Boyd v. Archer, supra; McNally v. Hill, \n293 \nU.S. 131\n, 55 S.Ct. 24. 'The prisoner is detained, not by virtue of the warrant of commitment, but on account of the judgment and sentence.' Biddle, Warden, v. Shirley (C.C.A.) 16 F.(2d) 566, 567; Howard v. United States (C.C.A.) 75 F. 986, 989, 34 L.R.A. 509; Ex parte Wilson, \n114 \nU.S. 417, 422\n, 5 S.Ct. 935; People ex rel. Trainor v. Baker, supra. If the judgment and sentence do not authorize his detention, no 'mittimus' will avail to make detention lawful.\n The argument is made that there is a practice in the Maryland District to make the commitment broader than the judgment, and that the practice should be given the quality of law. There is no such overriding virtue in usage or tradition. The court speaks through its judgment, and not through any other medium. It is not within the power of a judge by instructions to a clerk to make some other medium the authentic organ of his will. We are told that the instructions may be likened to a rule of court. They were not published; they were not reduced to writing; they are lacking in the formal safeguards that protect against mistake and perhaps against oppression. Cf. Rio Grande Irrigation Co. v. Gildersleeve, \n174 \nU.S. 603, 608\n, 19 S.Ct. 761; Weil v. Neary, 278 U.S. \n\n[298 U.S. 460, 466]\n\u00a0\n 160, 169, 49 S.Ct. 144. There are times when settled usage is as efficacious as a written rule to fix the forms of practice. United States v. Stevenson, Fed.Cas. No. 16,395; Norton v. Rich, Fed.Cas. No. 10, 352; Detroit Heating & Lighting Co. v. Kemp, (C.C.) 182 F. 847. A court will be cautious in applying such a doctrine where liberty is at stake. But here the traditional instructions have a defect more deepseated than the absence of a writing. Taken at their face value, they fall short of the effect imputed to them. They do not profess to regulate the form or content of the sentence, which is to be recorded by the clerk without addition or amendment. They are aimed at the commitment, at that and nothing else, imparting to it a capacity, a supersedi g virtue, unknown to the law. Something more is needed than a few words of unrecorded talk between a judge and a prothonotary to compass that result.\n The refusal to modify the warrant of commitment is not a bar to the relief now prayed by the relator. Finality within the doctrine or res judicata does not attach to every ruling upon law made by a judge upon the decision of a motion. Denny v. Bennett, \n128 \nU.S. 489, 499\n, 9 S.Ct. 134; Riggs v. Pursell, 74 N.Y. 370, 378; cf. American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, \n287 \nU.S. 156, 166\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 86 A.L.R. 298. This is true though the ruling may have been pertinent or even necessary to the conclusion reached. In such circumstances finality will rarely be extended beyond the terms of the order, and applied to the supporting reasons. There is nothing in this case to call for a departure from the general rule.\n A warrant of commitment spends its force, it fulfills what is at least its primary purpose, upon delivery of the prisoner at the place of his imprisonment. When 'the prisoner is safely in the proper custody, there is no office for a mittimus to perform.' People ex rel. Trainor v. Baker, supra; Howard v. United States, supra. Even \n\n[298 U.S. 460, 467]\n\u00a0\n after such delivery, the warrant is convenient evidence for the protection of the jailer, but it may be lost or destroyed, and detention may be justified by the underlying judgment. Ibid.; and see Ex parte Wilson, supra. The effect of an order refusing an amendment is to be adjudged with due regard to the character and office of the thing to be amended. At the time of that order the relator was lawfully imprisoned, the term of eighteen months being still unexpired. At the time of this petition the term was at an end, and imprisonment from then on had been turned into a wrong. The commitment was neither better nor worse because of the ruling of the judge that he would let it stand as written. If void, it was still void; if valid, it had received no accession of validity. What was said by the judge in the course of his opinion may be significant as a precedent; it is ineffective as a bar. The writ of habeas corpus searches the record back of the commitment. It lays a duty on the court to explore the foundations, and pronounce them false or true.\n We answer the questions submitted to us as follows, interpreting them, however, as explained in the opinion:\n To the first question we say that the provision is void.\n To the second question we answer 'no,' and to the third question 'yes.'\n Ordered accordingly. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] See United States v.

STEIN(1936)\nNo. 659\nArgued: Decided: April 27, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. James T. Brady and Edward E. Odom, both of Washington, D.C., and Y. D. Mathes, of Houston, Tex., for petitioner. \n\n[298 U.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n Mr. David A. Reed, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n Respondent, as guardian for her son, an incompetent veteran, applied to the court of common pleas, Allegheny county, Pa., to whose orders she was subject (50 P.S.Pa.  941 et seq.), for permission to pay 'out of the funds in her hands the sum of $100.00 to Hallock C. Sherrard, Esq., for his services and expenses and making the trip to Washington, D.C., to represent her in her claim for her said son's estate before said Board of Veterans' Appeals.' The Administration had discontinued the veteran's compensation of $100 per month, upon the ground that disability existed prior to enlistment. Request for reinstatement was set for hearing before the Board of Veterans' Appeals at Washington, March 28, 1934. Respondent held for the estate $2,000, apparently pension money received from the Veterans' Administration. Mr. Sherrard had represented her since appointment and acted upon her request.\n Petitioner, Frank T. Hines, appearing by counsel, admitted rendition of the services as stated. Reasonableness of the charge, if not inhibited by law, was not questioned. He denied the guardian's authority to contract for the expenditure and insisted that the application for permission to pay was not according to law. He asked \n\n[298 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n that the prayer be limited to actual expenses incurred and a fee of $2.\n The court of common pleas granted the guardian permission to pay as she had prayed; upon the Administrator's appeal, the superior court approved; the Supreme Court refused further hearing.\n Petitioner submits that Congress, proceeding within its delegated power, directly, or through authorized executive action, has prescribed permissible fees for services such as those rendered by Sherrard, and directed how they may be paid. Also has inhibited payment of other or different sum in any manner.\n We need not consider the extent of congressional power in this regard, since we are of opinion that, properly construed, the provisions relied upon do not apply where payments like the one here involved are directed by a state court having jurisdiction over the guardian of an incompetent veteran.\n The petition for certiorari asserts that the objections to respondent's application to the court of common pleas were based upon the President's Order of March 31, 1933 No. 6098, 38 U.S.C.A.  700 et seq. note (Veterans' Regulation No. 10), permitted by sections 4 and 7 of the Act of March 20, 1933, c. 3, 48 Stat. 9, 38 U.S.C.A.  704, 707; 'Instructions' promulgated by the Administrator under authority of that Order; and sections 111, 114, and 115, title 38, U.S.C.A.\n It is true that the provisions cited place general restrictions upon the fees of attorneys in connection with pension matters and prescribe the method of payment. But we find nothing in any of these acts of Congress which definitely undertakes to put limitation upon state courts in respect of guardians or to permit any executive officer, by rule or otherwise, to disregard and set at naught orders by courts to guardians appointed by them. Conflict in respect of such matters between state courts and the federal government, its officers or bureaus, would be un- \n\n[298 U.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n seemly, perhaps extremely unfortunate. And in the absence of compelling language, we cannot conclude that there was intention to create a situation where this probably would occur.\n During many years, Congress has recognized the propriety, if not the necessity, of intrusting the custody and management of funds belonging to incompetent pensioners to fiduciaries appointed by state courts, without seeking to limit judicial power in respect of them. To the contrary, it has directed that whenever any guardian, curator, or conservator fails properly to execute his trust, etc., the Administrator may 'appear in the court which has appointed ... and make proper presentation of such matters.' Chapter 723,  2, 44 Stat. 792, amended by chapter 510,  1, 49 Stat. 607, 38 U.S.C.A.  450. Authority of the state courts over guardians for incompetents is thus definitely recognized. The Administrator is expressly empowered to suspend further payments if the guardian is found to be acting improperly; so much is possible without conflict.\n Nothing brought to our attention would justify the view that Congress intended to deprive state courts of their usual authority over fiduciaries, or to sanction the promulgation of rules to that end by executive officers or bureaus.\n The broad purpose of regulations in respect of fees of those concerned with pension matters is to protect the United States and beneficiaries against extortion, imposition, or fraud. Calhoun v. Massie, \n253 \nU.S. 170, 173\n, 40 S.Ct. 474. Dangers of this character are not to be expected in connection with the orderly exercise of authority by state courts over appointees properly intrusted with pension funds. The purpose in view is for consideration when the true meaning of statute or rule is sought.\n The challenged decree must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n298 \nU.S. 692\n, 56 S.Ct. 945, 80 L.Ed. --.[ Hines v.

That provision contemplates the employment of this writ in instances not covered by section 240 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  347 ( 28 U.S.C.A.  347)), and affords ample authority for using the writ as an auxiliary process and as a means 'of giving full force and effect to existing appellate authority and of furthering justice in other kindred ways.'

Coty, \n262 \nU.S. 159, 162\n, 43 S.Ct. 531, 532.\n The record presents the petition for appeal and the order confirming the plan of reorganization. It appears that the principal property of the debtor, the 620 Church Street Building Corporation, consists of certain leaseholds and improvements known as the Carlson Building Annex. The allowed claims include first mortgage bonds of $445,500 upon which interest is due from January, 1931, second mortgage notes for $40,250, with interest from December, 1929, and a third mortgage note for $27,000, with interest from December, 1931. Petitioners are the debtor, the holders of the second and third mortgages, and stockholders.\n The order of confirmation sets forth the findings of the District Court that the property in question has a fair market value of $245,025 and that there is no equity over and above the $445,500 of the first mortgage bonds; that the debtor is insolvent; that the claims of the junior lienors, the holders of the second and third mortgages, are of no value and hence that no securities or cash should be distributed under the plan in respect to their claims; that stockholders are not entitled to participate in the \n\n[299 U.S. 24, 27]\n\u00a0\n plan; and that the plan is 'fair, equitable, and feasible and does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class or classes of creditors or stockholders.'\n The evidence before the District Court is not presented by the record. And as the Court of Appeals, if the appeal had been allowed, could have revised the ruling of the court below only in matter of law, it necessarily follows-and was conceded at the bar-that petitioners are bound by the findings of fact. Petitioners insist that their consent to the plan of reorganization was necessary or that their claims should have been accorded 'adequate protection.' But the adequate protection to which the statute refers is 'for the realization of the value of the interests, claims or liens' affected. Here the controlling finding is not only that there was no equity in the property above the first mortgage, but that petitioners' claims were appraised by the court as having 'no value.' There was no value to be protected. This finding embraces whatever interests petitioners may have as junior lienors under the Illinois law, and, in the same aspect, the constitutional argument is unavailing as petitioners have not shown injury.

HANSON(1936)\nNo. 427\nArgued: February 14, 1936Decided: March 2, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Orson P. Soule, of Salt Lake City, Utah, and Horace L. Lohnes, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Messrs. Charles D. Moore, of Salt Lake City, Utah, and O. A. Tangren, of Delta, Utah, for appellee.\n Mr. Grover A. Giles, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for State Tax Commission of State of Utah, amicus curiae.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Appellee brought this suit in the state district court to quiet his title to certain land in Millard county, Utah. He alleged that the general taxes against the land for they year 1926 had not been paid, and that as a result a tax deed of the property was taken by the county which had conveyed the land to him. The land lay within the \n\n[297 U.S. 378, 379]\n\u00a0\n boundaries of the Midland county drainage district No. 3. Appellants are owners of the bonds of the drainage d strict. They set up that the bonds were payable by annual assessments and levy of drainage taxes under the statutes of Utah in force when the bonds were sold. Compiled Laws of Utah, 1917,  2055, 2057, 2058, 2071, 2072, 2073. They contend that the provisions of the statute became part of the obligations of their bonds and required that when general taxes and drainage taxes became delinquent there should be but one notice of sale, and but one certificate of sale and tax deed, in which all general and special taxes should be included.\n In 1921 (Laws 1921, c. 47), and again in 1925 (Laws 1925, c. 109), section 2058 of the Compiled Laws of Utah was amended so as to provide that lands sold for delinquent district taxes should be sold separately for such taxes and that a separate certificate of sale should be issued. Appellants contend that the amendment impaired the obligation of their contracts in violation of the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States (Const. art. 1,  10), and hence that the separate sale in question, exclusively for the nonpayment of general taxes, and appellee's tax deed were void. The amended statute was also assailed as depriving appellants of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The state district court overruled these contentions and entered judgment quieting appellee's title 'against the lien and cloud' of the bonds of the drainage district. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state (Hanson v. Burris, 46 P.(2d) 400), and the case comes here on appeal.\n It is not disputed that under the laws of Utah taxes for general governmental purposes are paramount to all other demands against the property to which the tax lien attaches. Robinson v. Hanson, 75 Utah, 30, 282 P. 782. The state court held that the challenged amendment did not make any substantial change in the rights of the holders of the drainage district bonds. Two \n\n[297 U.S. 378, 380]\n\u00a0\n opinions were delivered. By separate paths they reached the same result. In the principal opinion by Justice Moffat, it was said: 'The manner by which the drainage tax lien is made effective for the purpose of reaching the security to which the bond lien attaches is substantially the same since the amendment as before, even considering the statutory references in the drainage tax law as making the procedure for the collection of general taxes applicable. By the procedure prescribed, no added burden is placed upon the drainage district nor the bondholder whereby the lien provided by the statute is impaired, nor is it made more difficult of enforcement. ... That the lien for general taxes was superior to the lien for drainage district taxes was as much the law then as it is now. No right to pursue and make effective the drainage tax lien has been taken away or impaired. ... Between the time of sale and expiration of the redemption period, and during which there is outstanding a certificate of sale for both delinquencies for nonpayment of general and drainage taxes, the drainage district may pay general taxes and take tax sale certificate. After the period of redemption has expired, the drainage district, upon payment of the general taxes, is entitled to a deed vesting it with title to the property sold for drainage taxes, if general taxes have been paid and drainage taxes have not. This is the ultimate limit to which the drainage district and the bondholders were entitled to go at any time, whether before or after the amended statutes.' Hanson v. Burris (Utah) 46 P.(2d) 400, 409, 410. In the concurring opinion of Justice Wolfe, it was said that the words of the statute 'meant the same before the amendment of 1921 as the amendment itself specifies, and that said amendment was for the purpose of clarifying and not changing the law.' Further, that 'the tax officials in 1920, before and after the amendment, followed a procedure which was justified by the statutes through- \n\n[297 U.S. 378, 381]\n\u00a0\n out, and followed the method of assessing, notifying, levying and collecting taxes as the same was in force at the time of the issuance of the bonds.' Id., 46 P. (2d) 400, 418.\n While this court, in enforcing the contract clause, may determine for itself the meaning and effect of the contract (Appleby v. City of New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364, 380\n, 46 S.Ct. 569; Larson v. South Dakota, \n278 \nU.S. 429, 433\n, 49 S.Ct. 196), we see no reason for not accepting the ruling of the state court as to the construction of the statute in question and the state practice. We find no basis for a conclusion that, under the amendment, the procedure for enforcing the liens of drainage district taxes was substantially different from that which obtained before the amendment, or that the contract rights of the bondholders have been impaired.

UNITED STATES(1936)\nNo. 758\nArgued: April 8, 1936Decided: April 27, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. \n\n[298 U.S. 131, 132]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Martin A. Schenck and Drury W. Cooper, both of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. John Dickinson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal, section 238 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  345, from so much of a decree of a District Court for Southern New York as enjoins the appellant from leasing its tabulating and other machines upon the condition that the lessees shall use with such machines only tabulating cards manufactured by appellant, as a violation of section 3 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C.  14 (15 U.S.C.A.  14).\n The government brought the suit against appellant and three other corporations, all manufacturers of machines performing substantially the same functions as appellant's, to restrain the use by each of the defendants of a specified type of lease of their machines as a violation of the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730), and to declare void under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note) a contract into which they had entered, by which each agreed to use that type of lease, and not to solicit the lessees of machines of the others to purchase tabulating cards which it manufactures. The case was tried upon the pleadings and a stipulation of facts, in which the defendants consented to a decree canceling \n\n[298 U.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n their agreement with each other. Two of the defendants have been eliminated from the suit; one by dissolution and the other by merger with appellant. A third defendant, Remington Rand, Inc., has stipulated that the decree to be entered against it shall conform to that entered against appellant upon this appeal.\n Appellant's machines and those of Remington Rand, Inc., are now the only ones on the market which perform certain mechanical tabulations and computations, without any intervening manual operation, by the use in them of cards upon which are recorded data which are the subject of tabulation or computation. Appellant manufactures three types of machines, known as punching machines, sorters, and tabulators. The punching machines are used to perforate cards, called tabulating cards, in such manner that the positions of the perforations indicate numerical or other data. When the cards are passed through the sorter or tabulator, control of its mechanism is effected by electrical circuits established by contacts through the perforations. The cards are thus made permanent records of information, and by the perforations are given such form that they may be used, as often as required, to control the function of the machines through which they are passed. The sorting machines are used to sort the perforated cards so as to classify them by the selection and segregation, in the desired manner, of those signifying any particular type of information. The tabulating machines are used to record the information denoted by the perforated cards or to make computations based upon it. In the Remington Rand machines the control is not electrical, but is accomplished by the use of cards which admit of the movement, into the perforations, of small pins which, by linkage, guide the mechanical operation of the machine so as to effect the desired result. \n\n[298 U.S. 131, 134]\n\u00a0\n To insure satisfactory performance by appellant's machines it is necessary that the cards used in them conform to precise specifications as to size and thickness, and that they be free from defects due to slime or carbon spots, which cause unintended electrical contacts and consequent inaccurate results. The cards manufactured by appellant are electrically tested for such defects.\n Appellant leases its machines for a specified rental and period, upon condition that the lease shall terminate in case any cards not manufactured by the lessor are used in the leased machine. A special form of lease has been granted to the government by which it is permitted to use cards of its own manufacture upon paying a 15 per cent. increase in the rental of the leased machines, but upon condition that the lease shall be terminable if the government uses such cards without payment of the additional rental.\n Appellant insists that the condition of its leases is not within the prohibition of the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730), and it has assigned as error the conclusion of the District Court that the condition tends to create monopoly. But its principal contentions are that its leases are lawful because the protection secured by the condition does not extend beyond the monopoly which it has acquired by patents on the cards and on the machines in which they are used, and that in any case the condition is permissible under section 3 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.A.  14) because its purpose and effect are only to preserve to appellant the good will of its patrons by preventing the use of unsuitable cards which would interfere with the successful performance of its machines.\n\n 1. \nSection 3 of the Clayton Act, so far as it is applicable to the present case, provides that 'It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease ... machinery ... whether patented or unpatented, for use ... within the United States ... on the condition ... that the lessee ... \n\n[298 U.S. 131, 135]\n\u00a0\n shall not use ... supplies or other commodities of a competitor, ... where the effect of such lease ... or such condition ... may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.' The statute thus in precise terms makes unlawful a condition that the lessee shall not use the supplies or commodities of a competitor of the lessor if the effect of the condition 'may be' to lessen competition substantially, or if it tends to create a monopoly.\n Little need be said of the contention that the condition of appellant's leases does not infringe these prohibitions. It is true that the condition is not in so many words against the use of the cards of a competitor, but is affirmative in form, that the lessee shall use only appellant's cards in the leased machines. But as the lessee can make no use of the cards except with the leased machines, and the specified use of appellant's cards precludes the use of the cards of any competitor, the condition operates in the manner forbidden by the statute. See United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 451, 457\n, 458 S., 42 S.Ct. 363; compare Federal Trade Commission v. Sinclair Ref. Co., \n261 \nU.S. 463, 474\n, 43 S.Ct. 450. A different question is presented from that in the Sinclair Case, where a wholesale distributor of gasoline leased gasoline pumps to retail dealers with the stipulation that they should not be used for the pumping of gasoline of the lessor's competitors. As the only use made of the gasoline was to sell it, and as there was no restraint upon the purchase and sale of competing gasoline, there was no violation of the Clayton Act.\n The conclusion of the trial court that appellant's leases infringe the monopoly provisions of the section does not want for support in the record. The agreed use of the 'tying clause' by appellant and its only competitors, and the agreement by each of them to restrict its competition in the sale of cards to the lessees of the others, have oper- \n\n[298 U.S. 131, 136]\n\u00a0\n ated to prevent competition and to create a monopoly in the production and sale of tabulating cards suitable for appellant's machines, as the District Court found. The commerce in tabulating cards is substantial. Appellant makes and sells 3,000,000,000 cards annually, 81 per cent. of the total, indicating that the sales by the Remington Rand Company, its only competitor, representing the remaining 19 per cent., are approximately 600,000,000. It is stipulated that appellant derives a 'substantial' profit from its card sales. The gross receipts from its machines during the past ten years have averaged $9,710,389 a year, and an average of $3,192,700, has been derived annually from the sale of its cards. These facts, and others, which we do not stop to enumerate, can leave no doubt that the effect of the condition in appellant's leases 'may be to substantially lessen competition,' and that it tends to create monopoly, and has in fact been an important and effective step in the creation of monopoly.\n\n 2. \nOn the trial appellant offered to prove its ownership of patents which, it asserts, give it a monopoly of the right to manufacture, use, and vend the cards, separately, and in combination with its sorting and tabulating machines, of which, it insists, they are a part. It argues that the condition of its leases is lawful because it does not enlarge the monopoly secured by the patents, and that the trial court erred in refusing to consider appellant's patent monopoly as a defense to the suit.\n Appellant's patents appear to extend only to the cards when perforated, and to have no application to those which the lessees purchase before they are punched. The contention is thus reduced to the dubious claim that the sale of he unpunched cards is a contributory infringement of the patents covering the use of perforated cards separately and in combination with the machines.

We rest it rather on the language of section 3 of the Clayton Act which expressly makes tying clauses unlawful, whether the machine leased is 'patented or unpatented.' The section does not purport to curtail the patent monopoly of the lessor or to restrict its protection by suit for infringement. But it does in terms deny to the lessor of a patented, as well as of an unpatented machine, the benefit of any condition or agreement that the lessee shall not use the supplies of a competitor. The only purpose or effect of the tying clause, so far as it could be effectively applied to patented articles, is either to prevent the use, by a lessee, of the product of a competitor of the lessor, where the lessor's patent, prima facie, embraces that product, and thus avoid judicial review of the patent, or else to compel its examination in every suit brought to set aside the tying clause, although the suit could usually result in no binding adjudication as to the validity of the patent, since infringement would not be in issue. The phrase 'whether patented or unpatented' would seem well chosen to foreclose the possibility of either alternative.\n When Congress had before it the bill which became section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  14, it was familiar with the decision of this Court in Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., \n224 \nU.S. 1\n, 32 S.Ct. 364, Ann.Cas.1913D, 880, and with the contentions made in United States v. United Shoe Mach. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 32, 33\n, 38 S.Ct. 473, then pending before this Court; cases in which it was held that a tying clause could lawfully be extended to unpatented supplies for a leased patented machine. Cong.Rec., vol. 51, part 14, 63rd Cong., 2d Sess., 14,089 ff.; see Henderson, The Federal Trade Commission, 30. One purpose of section 3 undoubtedly was to prevent such use of the tying clause. United Shoe \n\n[298 U.S. 131, 138]\n\u00a0\n Mach. Corp. v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 451\n, 42 S.Ct. 363. But the debates on section 3, on the floor of the Senate, disclose that it was well known to that body that one of the contentions in the pending cause, United States v. United Shoe Mach. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 32, 33\n, 38 S.Ct. 473, was that it was permissible, in any circumstances, for a lessor to tie several patented articles together. They show that the proponents of the bill were as much concerned that that practice should be prohibited as that the tying of nonpatented to patented articles should be ended. Cong.Rec., vol. 51, part 14, 63rd Cong., 3rd Sess., 14275. The phrase, 'whether patented or unpatented,' as used in section 3 is as applicable to the one practice as to the other. It would fail of the purpose which it plainly expresses if it did not operate to preclude the possibility of both, and to make the validity of the tying clause a matter to be determined independently of the protection afforded by any monopoly of the lessor. Such, we think, must be taken to be the effect of the section unless its language and history are to be disregarded. Under its provisions the lawfulness of the tying clause must be ascertained by applying to it the standards prescribed by section 3 as though the leased article and its parts were unpatented.\n\n 3. \nDespite the plain language of section 3, making unlawful the tying clause when it tends to create a monopoly, appellant insists that it does not forbid tying clauses whose purpose and effect are to protect th good will of the lessor in the leased machines, even though monopoly ensues. In support of this contention appellant places great emphasis on the admitted fact that it is essential to the successful performance of the leased machines that the cards used in them conform, with relatively minute tolerances, to specifications as to size, thickness, and freedom from defects which would affect adversely the electrical circuits indispensable to the proper \n\n[298 U.S. 131, 139]\n\u00a0\n operation of the machines. The point is stressed that failure, even though occasional, to conform to these requirements, causes inaccuracies in the functioning of the machine, serious in their consequences and difficult to trace to their source, with consequent injury to the reputation of the machines and the good will of the lessors.\n There is no contention that others than appellant cannot meet these requirements. It affirmatively appears, by stipulation, that others are capable of manufacturing cards suitable for use in appellant's machines, and that paper required for that purpose may be obtained from the manufacturers who supply appellant. The Remington Rand Company manufactures cards suitable for its own machines, but since it has been barred by the agreement with appellant from selling its cards for use in appellant's machines, its cards are not electrically tested. The government, under the provisions of its lease, following its own methods, has made large quantities of the cards, which are in successful use with appellant's machines. The suggestion that without the tying clause an adequate supply of cards would not be forthcoming from competitive sources is not supported by the evidence. 'The very existence of such restrictions suggests that in its absence a competing article of equal or better quality would be offered at the same or at a lower price.' Carbice Corporation v. American Patents Development Corp., supra, \n283 U.S. 27\n, at page 32, 51 S.Ct. 334, 335, 822, note 2, quoting Vaughan, Economics of Our Patent System, 125, 127. Appellant's sale of cards return a substantial profit and the government's payment of 15 per cent. increase in rental to secure the privilege of making its own cards is profitable only if it produces the cards at a cost less than 55 per cent. of the price charged by appellant.\n Appellant is not prevented from proclaiming the virtues of its own cards or warning against the danger of using, in its machines, cards which do not conform to the \n\n[298 U.S. 131, 140]\n\u00a0\n necessary specifications, or even from making its leases conditional upon the use of cards which conform to them. For aught that appears such measures would protect its good will, without the creation of monopoly or resort to the suppression of competition.\n The Clayton Act names no exception to its prohibition of monopolistic tying clauses. Even if we are free to make an exception to its unambiguous command, see United States v. United Shoe Mach. Co. (D.C.) 264 F. 138, 167; 1 Auto Acetylene Light Co. v. Prest-O-Lite Co. (C.C.A.) 276 F. 537; Pick Manufacturing Co. v. General Motors Corp. (C.C.A.) 80 F.(2d) 641; cf. Radio Corporation v. Lord (C.C.A.) 28 F.(2d) 257, we can perceive no tenable basis for an exception in favor of a condition whose substantial benefit to the lessor is the elimination of business competition and the creation of monopoly, rather than the protection of its good will, and where it does not appear that the latter cannot be achieved by methods which do not tend to monopoly and are not otherwise unlawful.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In this case the Government sought no review of the determination of the district court that the tying clause was valid so far as it requires lessees to purchase of the lessor supplies and parts of the leased machines.

CO.(1936)\nNo. 252\nArgued: March 11, 1936Decided: March 30, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Cecil Sims and Louis Leftwich, both of Nashville, Tenn., and Isidor Rahn, of Evansville, Ind., for appellant. \n\n[297 U.S. 657, 658]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles C. Trabue, of Nashville, Tenn., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The present appeal challenges a statute of Tennessee on the ground that, as construed and applied, it impairs the obligation of a contract in contravention of article 1,  10 of the Federal Constitution.\n March 12, 1928, National Construction Company made a contract with the state, through its Department of Highways and Public Works, for the construction of a bridge. An act of 1917 required such a contractor to furnish a bond with surety to protect the state and to secure payment to persons furnishing materials, supplies, and labor for the project. \n1\n The company executed \n\n[297 U.S. 657, 659]\n\u00a0\n such a bond with the appellee as surety. The appellant agreed with the Construction Company to furnish certain labor and materials for the erection of the bridge. Upon completion of the structure, the appellant claimed a balance of about $59,000. There remained in the possession of the Highway Department some $77,000 which had been retained out of the contract price as directed by the Act of 1917. In the meantime, the act had been amended on April 11, 1929,2 to provide that instead of withholding the retained percentage pending the presentation of claims by subcontractors, and paying into court so much as might be necessary to answer suits brought on those claims, the Commissioner of Highways might, upon the date of final settlement, release and pay to the principal contractor the amount so retained, against a refunding bond with proper surety, conditioned for the payment of valid claims of sub-contractors. 3 Pursuant to this amendatory act, the Commissioner, \n\n[297 U.S. 657, 660]\n\u00a0\n without notice to or consent of the appellant, made final settlement with the Construction Company and paid it the retained percentage, taking a refunding bond with the Equitable Casualty & Surety Company as surety. Thereupon, the appellant filed a bill in the Chancery Court of Davidson County against the Construction Company, the appellee as surety on the contractor's bond, the Commissioner, and the Equitable Company as surety on the refunding bond, reciting the facts and praying a decree for the balance due under its contract. The Construction Company answered and cross-claimed for alleged breach of contract, asserting that there was no sum due the appellant. The appellee answered asserting that the payment of the retained percentage and the acceptance of a refunding bond released it as surety from liability to the Department of Highways or to subcontractors. The Commissioner's answer recited his acts in the premises. The appellant replied to the cross-bill. A decree was entered in favor of the Commissioner against the Construction Company and Equitable Company on the refunding bond. Subsequently the Commissioner informed the court that the Equitable Company had become insolvent and it was proposed to substitute a refunding bond of the Construction Company as principal and Consolidated Indemnity & Insurance Company as surety in the penal sum of $ 40,000, in place of the original refunding bond, and lodge the new bond in court, such action not to release the Construction Company under the original refunding bond but to operate as a release of the receiver and liquidating agent of the Equitable Company. It was ordered that the bond be taken and lodged in court to await the outcome of the litigation.\n The chancellor thereafter heard the cause on the merits, found in favor of the appellant for a balance of \n\n[297 U.S. 657, 661]\n\u00a0\n approximately $58,000, held that the amendatory act of 1929 did not affect the appellee's liability under the bond, but substituted a refunding bond in lieu of the moneys retained by the Commissioner, that the appellant should look first to the refunding bond and, after its exhaustion, recover from the appellee any amount remaining unpaid. The appellee took the case to the Court of Appeals of the state, where it insisted upon its position that the acceptance of a refunding bond and the release of the retained percentage operated to discharge its bond. That court reversed the chancellor's decision, holding that the act of 1929 was prospective in operation and did not apply to the state's contract with the Construction Company; that the action of the Commissioner in taking a refunding bond and releasing the retained percentage was unlawful, operated to the prejudice of the appellee as surety on the contract bond, and released it from liability. Both appellant and appellee were granted writs of certiorari by the Supreme Court of Tennessee. The former assigned error to the holding that the action of the Commissioner in paying over the retained funds and taking a refunding bond released the appellee as surety. The latter assigned error to the holding that the amendatory act of 1929 was inapplicable to the contract in question and that the Commissioner was not authorized thereby to proceed as he did, and thus satisfy and discharge the obligation of appellee's bond.\n Upon grounds differing from those stated by the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court affirmed the decree. It held the amendatory act retroactive and applicable to the contract of the Construction Company; and the Commissioner's action lawful and effective to supersede and annul the contract bond.\n In the course of the opinion the court said: '... our construction of chapter 80 of the Acts of 1929 does \n\n[297 U.S. 657, 662]\n\u00a0\n not bring that statute into any constitutional difficulty.' Except for thi statement, the record failed to disclose that a question under the Federal Constitution had been presented or decided. In the circumstances, this court had no jurisdiction upon appeal. Counsel for the appellant requested at the bar a continuance of the cause to afford opportunity for amplification of the record disclosing the basis of decision. \n4\n The application was granted, a petition was filed in the court below, and, in response thereto, the court added to its opinion a recital that a reargument had been ordered upon 'the constitutionality, construction, and applicability' of chapter 80 of the Acts of 1929, and, prior to reargument, counsel for the appellant had filed a brief raising the federal constitutional question under Article I, section 10, and the Court intended to express the opinion that the act, as construed by it, 'did not impair the obligation of contracts in violation of ... the contract clause of ... the Constitution of the United States.' These additional proceedings have been certified and added to the record. Upon the record as thus supplemented, we have jurisdiction.\n The contention is that chapter 80 of the Acts of 1929, as construed, releases and discharges the obligation of the appellee's bond to pay the balance due the appellant, and that such destruction of the obligation cannot be justified by substituting a right of action on another bond without appellant's consent. The appellant says that under the local law the bond given by the a pellee is of a dual nature, running both to the state and to subcontractors; and its execution created a direct contractual relation between the surety and those who furnished material and labor for the erection of the bridge, the obligation of appellee to appellant coming into existence at the moment the latter made its contract with the Con- \n\n[297 U.S. 657, 663]\n\u00a0\n struction Company. \n5\n The Supreme Court of Tennessee, though so holding, thought the act of 1929 merely affected the appellant's remedy without impairing its substantive rights. It treated the act of 1917, pursuant to which appellee gave its bond, as having 'the same general purpose as the mechanic's lien statutes.' It said: 'The beneficiaries of the legislation are given a lien under private contracts, recourse on the bond under public contracts.' After stating that it was unnecessary to decide whether a mechanic's lian,-a remedy created by statute and not by the contract of the parties-may be abolished or modified by statute without impairing the obligation of the contract, or, on the contrary, the lienor has a vested interest in the remedy, upon accrual of his lien, of which the cannot be deprived without such impairment, the court disposed of the appellant's contention thus: 'If we concede that the materialman's lien in the one instance, or his recourse on the bond in the other instance, enters into his contract and is a part thereof, and that a remedy so embraced cannot be impaired without impairing the obligation of the contract, still our construction of chapter 80 of the Acts of 1929 does not bring that statute into any constitutional difficulty. We construe the statute as regulating, after its passage, the procedure to be followed by all parties in respect to the final settlement of every highway contract, whether the contract itself was made before or after the enactment of chapter 80 of the Acts of 1929.'\n This view seems to us to confuse the remedies for the enforcement of two distinct contracts involved in every similar situation. The subcontractor has a contract with \n\n[297 U.S. 657, 664]\n\u00a0\n the principal contractor, but none with the owner. The mechanics' lien law gives the subcontractor no additional redress against the principal contractor for breach by the latter of his subcontract. Because the subcontractor's labor and material go to enhance the value of the owner's property, the law places that property in peril of a lien for payment of the subcontractor, unless the owner sees that he is paid. Abolition of the lien destroys no remedy which the subcontractor could have invoked as against his employer, with whom alone he has a contract. The act of 1917, on the other hand, instead of creating a right of lien against the owner, who is a stranger to the subcontract, requires that if a bidder for public works is to become the contractor therefor he must procure a bondsman for the payment of his subcontractors. The statute itself confers no contractual right on any subcontractor, nor does it by its own force confer upon him any new remedy for the enforcement as against the principal contractor of the obligation of any contract the two may make. A bondsman is invited to come forward and agree to indemnify the subcontractor. If he does so, he acts voluntarily. For a consideration sufficient to move him, he contracts directly with the subcontractor to assure the satisfaction of his just claims against the principal contractor. The remedy for a breach of this undertaking is an action at law.\n The appellee voluntarily gave its bond. How does chapter 80 of the Acts of 1929 affect the obligation of that contract? As construed by the Supreme Court of the state, it releases and discharges the obligation of the bond, and substitutes theref r the obligation of another bond without the acquiescence of the obligee. This is not to substitute a new for the old remedy against the surety. It is to declare the surety's obligation unenforceable, in short, no longer a subsisting obligation. \n\n[297 U.S. 657, 665]\n\u00a0\n Beyond doubt the statute thus violates the contract clause of the Constitution.\n The respondent insists that as the appellant joined the Equitable Company, surety on the refunding bond, as a defendant, it sought to take advantage of the amendatory act of 1929 and is now estopped to question the constitutional validity of the statute. Appellant replies that the suit went upon the theory adopted by the chancellor that the amendatory act was not retroactive so as to release the earlier bond but intended merely to substitute a refunding bond in the place of the funds retained by the Highway Commissioner which, under the original act, were also held for satisfaction of the appellant's claim. Such a construction of an act which had not been passed upon by any court was permissible, and if, as now appears, the appellant was in error in so construing the act, the mistake cannot be made the basis of an estoppel. In both appellate courts the appellant insisted on its original view that the act of 1929 did not operate to discharge the obligation of the appellee's bond. The appellee asserted no estoppel in either of those tribunals. Not until the decision of the Supreme Court was there a holding that the act retroactively affected the enforcibility of the bond. Not until then was there occasion for appellant to urge that, if so construed, the act would impair the obligation of the bond. As we have indicated, the record discloses that when this construction of the act appeared probable, the appellant promptly raised the constitutional question. It cannot be estopped so to do by its previous insistence upon a construction which would render the statute consistent with the act of 1917 and present no constitutional difficulty. \n6\n The appellee says that estoppel, a nonfederal ground, adequate to \n\n[297 U.S. 657, 666]\n\u00a0\n support the judgment, was in the case from its inception. The point was not made or considered in the state courts. The validity of the act was adjudged on the issue of impairment of the obligation of the appellee's bond. We do not, therefore, consider the defense of estoppel.\n'The rule that when the decision of a state court may rest upon a nonfederal ground adequate to support it, this court will not take jurisdiction to determine the federal question, has no application where, as here, the nonfederal ground might have been considered by the state court but was not.' 7\n\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 74, Public Acts of Tennessee 1917 (page 217). By section 6 ( pages 222, 223) it is provided: 'All contractors with whom contracts are made by the Department shall enter into good and solvent surety bond in an amount fixed by the Department, conditioned upon the full and faithful performance of every part and stipulation of the contract, especially the payment for all materials purchased and for all labor employed in the contemplated work. ... Not more than ninety per cent. of the contract price shall be paid on any contract until it is completed and the work is accepted. Before final acceptance, the contractor must furnish evidence to satisfy the Department that all the material used by him, his sub- contractors, or his agents, has been fully paid for and all laborers and other employees working for him, his sub-contractors, or his agents, have been fully paid. When this is done, full settlement may be made with the contractor; but not until thirty days' notice in some newspaper ... that settlement is about to be made and notify (sic) all claimants to file notice of their claim with the Secretary of the Department.

YATES(1936)\nNo. 146\nArgued: Decided: December 7, 1936\n\n\n\n * Opinion of Supreme Court conformed to (Ga.) 190 S.E. 560. \n\n[299 U.S. 178, 179]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alex W. Smith, Jr., of Atlanta, Ga., and Byron K. Elliott, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edgar Watkins, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In May, 1932, the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, a Massachusetts corporation, insured the life of Harmon H. Yates, agreeing to pay upon his death $2,000 to his wife. The policy was applied for, issued and delivered, in New York, where he and his wife resided; and they remained there until his death of cancer in the following month. Then his widow removed to Georgia, and brought, in a court of that state, this suit on the policy. The case was tried before a jury.\n The Company contended that since the contract was made in New York, the existence of liability thereon is governed by the statutes of that state. It denied liability, upon the ground that answers in the application to the questions whether the applicant was then in good health, so far as he knew, whether he had ever been treated for cancer or indigestion, and whether he had had medical advice for any other disease or disorder during the period of five years prior to making the application were false; and that these were material misrepresentations.\n The Company proved, and it was undisputed, that the applicant had received medical treatment five times within the month preceding the application. It proved, also, that under the law of New York the mistatement made is a material misrepresentation which avoids the \n\n[299 U.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n policy, introducing section 58 of the New York Insurance Law (Consol.Laws, c. 28),1 which, as construed and applied in Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Pomerantz, 246 N.Y. 63, 158 N.E. 21 and Minsker v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 254 N.Y. 333, 173 N.E. 4, 81 A.L.R. 829, provides that the entire contract between the parties must be embodied in the policy, to which a copy of the application must be physically attached; that when the insured receives a policy, it is his duty to read it or have it read; that if an application incorporated therein does not contain correct answers to questions asked, it is his duty to have the answers corrected; that in case a false answer to a material question is not so corrected, the applicant cannot recover even if able to prove that he gave to the Examiner the true answer; that the agent of the Company is without power to waive this requirement of the policy; and that the false statement in the application that the applicant had not received medical advice constitutes a material misrepresentation which avoids the policy. It was not denied that such is the law of New York.\n The trial court overruled the Company's contention; permitted the plaintiff to testify, in effect, that true answers had been given orally by the applicant to the Company's agent, and that the agent had said that the answers as recorded in the application were correct; submitted to the jury the determination of the question whether the false statement in the application was a material misrepresentation; and, among other things, charged that 'if a policy is issued with knowledge by the agent of a fact or condition which, by the terms of the contract, would render it void, the insurer will be held to have waived the existence of such fact or condition, and the policy will not be voided thereby.' The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff; judgment was entered \n\n[299 U.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n thereon in the sum of $2,000; that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of Georgia (50 Ga.App. 713, 179 S.E. 239); and again by the Supreme Court of that state, two judges dissenting (182 Ga. 213, 185 S.E. 268). We granted certiorari (\n299 \nU.S. 525\n, 57 S.Ct. 20, 81 L.Ed. --), because of the claim that the state courts had refused to give to the public acts of New York full faith and credit as required by section 1 of article 4 of the Federal Constitution.\n The reason assigned by the Supreme Court of Georgia for its decision appears to be this: Under the law of that state, as elsewhere, the validity, form, and effect of contracts are to be determined generally by the law of the place where made, but the character and extent of the remedies and the mode of procedure by the law of the forum. Under its law, false answers to questions in an application furnish ground for avoiding a policy, if the matters involved are material to the risk; but whether the statements are material is a matter of fact to be decided by the jury. And, if the agent of the insurance company incorrectly records answers after the applicant has truthfully replied to the questions, the agent's actual knowledge of the facts will be imputed to the insurer, and the question for the jury then is as to the materiality of the misstatements on the face of the application, viewed in the light of the knowledge imputed to the insurer. \n2\n The manner in which this question of materiality shall be determined, and the effect of the disclosure made orally by the applicant to the agent, are matters affecting the remedy only, and not the validity, form or effect of the contract. Hence, the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution does not compel the application by \n\n[299 U.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n Georgia of the New York statute in this case. Such is the argument.\n The reasoning of the Georgia court, and the conclusion reached by it, are not sound. No question of remedy is presented. The Company sets up as a defense a substantive right conferred by a statute of New York. The contract of insurance was made, and the death of the insured occurred in that state. In respect to the accrual of the right asserted under the contract, or liability denied, there was no occurrence, nothing done, to which the law of Georgia could apply. Compare Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397, 408\n, 50 S.Ct. 338, 341, 74 A.L.R. 701. To sustain the defense involves merely recognition by the courts of Georgia that the parties have by their contract made in New York subjected themselves to certain conditions prescribed by its statute. Such recognition does not give to the New York statute extraterritorial effect. The statute of New York prescribes, or limits, the things which will be effective to create binding contracts of insurance, or terms in them. As construed by the highest court of the state, the statute makes the policy with the application annexed the entire contract between the parties. And it declares that a false answer in the application to the precise question here involved is a material misrepresentation which avoids the policy; and that the fact that a truthful answer was orally given to the agent but not recorded is without legal significance. In so declaring, the statute enacts a rule of substantive law3 which became a term of the contract, as much so as the amount of the premium to be paid or the time for its payment. The declaration by the statute as construed and applied by the highest court of New York that the false answer here involved is a material misrepresentation which avoids the policy determines the substantive rights of the parties as fully as if a provision \n\n[299 U.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n to that effect had been embodied in writing in the policy. To refuse to give that defense effect would irremediably subject the Company to liability. Compare Bradford Electric Light Co., Inc. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145, 160\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 576, 82 A.L.R. 696. Because the statute is a 'public act,' faith and credit must be given to its provisions as fully as if the materiality of this specific misrepresentation in the application, and the consequent nonexistence of liability, had been declared by a judgment of a New York court.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION(1936)\nNo. 640\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1936\n\n\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry O. Glasser, of Enid, Okl., and James M. Beck and H. I. Fischbach, both of New York City (Mr. J. N. Saye, of Longview, Tex., on the brief), for petitioner.\n Messrs. Stanley F. Reed, Sol. Gen., and John J. Burns, both of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n[298 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case arises under the Securities Act of 1933, c. 38, 48 Stat. 74, as amended by Act of June 6, 1934, c. 404, 48 Stat. 881, U.S.C. title 15,  77a et seq. (15 U.S.C.A.  77a et seq.). Prior to the \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n amendment, the act was administered by the Federal Trade Commission; but by Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  210, 48 Stat. 908 (15 U.S.C.A.  78ii), the administration was transferred to the respondent.\n The act, section 2(4), 15 U.S.C.A.  77b(4), defines the term 'issuer' as including every person who issues or proposes to issue any security, with certain exceptions. Section 6(a) of the act (15 U.S.C.A.  77f(a) provides: 'Any security may be registered with the Commission under the terms and conditions hereinafter provided, by filing a registration statement in triplicate, at least one of which shall be signed by each issuer.' The filing of the registration statement must be accompanied by the payment to the commission of a fee measured by the maximum aggregate price at which the securities are to be offered. The information contained in the statement is to be made available to the public under such regulations as the commission may prescribe. The act prescribes in detail the character of information which is to be set out in the statement. Elaborate provisions are made in respect of liability on account of false registration statements, etc., and penalties are imposed for willful violations of any of the provisions of the act, or the rules and regulations promulgated by the commission under authority thereof, and for willfully untrue statements of material facts or omissions to state material facts. Section 5(a), 15 U.S.C.A.  77e(a), provides that unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, it shall be unlawful for any person directly or indirectly to make use of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails to sell or offer to buy such security, etc., or to transport any such security for sale or for delivery after sale.\n'Sec. 8(a) The effective date of a registration statement shall be the twentieth day after the filing thereof, except as hereinafter provided , ...\n\n'(d) If it appears to the Commission at any time that the registration statement includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Commission may, after notice by personal service or the sending of confirmed telegraphic notice, and after opportunity for hearing (at a time fixed by the Commission) within fifteen days after such notice by personal service or the sending of such telegraphic notice, issue a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement. ...\n\n'(e) The Commission is hereby empowered to make an examination in any case in order to determine whether a stop order should issue under subsection (d). In making such examination the Commission or any officer or officers designated by it shall have access to and may demand the production of any books and papers of, and may administer oaths and affirmations to and examine, the issuer, underwriter, or any other person, in respect of any matter relevant to the examination, and may, in its discretion, require the production of a balance sheet exhibiting the assets and liabilities of the issuer, or its income statement, or both, to be certified to by a public or certified accountant approved by the Commission. If the issuer or underwriter shall fail to cooperate, or shall obstruct or refuse to permit the making of an examination, such conduct shall be p oper ground for the issuance of a stop order.' 15 U.S.C.A.  77h(a, d, e).\n\n Section 19(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  77s(b), provides that for the purpose of all investigations which the commission think necessary and proper for the enforcement of the act, any member of the commission or any designated officer may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, take evidence, and require the production of books, papers, etc. Section 22(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  77v(b), provides that in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued (by authority of the commission) to any person, the District Courts of the United States and others named, upon application by the commission, may issue to such person an order requiring him to appear \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n before the commission or one of its examiners, and there produce documentary evidence and give evidence touching the matter in question.\n May 4, 1935, petitioner filed with the commission a registration statement in pursuance of section 6(a) of the act, 15 U.S.C.A.  77f(a), covering a proposed issue of participation trust certificates. This registration statement under the terms of the act was to become effective 20 days later. On the nineteenth day, however, the commission, having already directed that stop-order proceedings be instituted, pursuant to section 8(d), 15 U.S.C.A.  77h(d), sent petitioner a telegraphic notice reciting that the registration statement appeared to contain untrue statements of material facts and to omit material facts required and necessary and fixing a hearing at the office of the commission for Thursday, June 6, 1935, 'at which time and place registrant may appear and show cause why a stop order should not be issued suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement.' The hearing was postponed until June 18th.\n On June 13, a subpoena duces tecum was issued commanding petitioner to appear before an officer of the commission on the 18th to testify with respect to his registration statement and to bring with him designated books, records, and papers, listed as follows: General ledger, subsidiary ledgers, journal, cash book, books of account and financial statements of J. Edward Jones; general ledger, journal, cash book and books of account of J. Edward Jones relating to J. Edward Jones Royalty Trust, Series 'M'; all contracts, agreements and correspondence of J. Edward Jones relating to the distribution of Participation Trust Certificates in J. Edward Jones Royalty Trust, Series 'M'; all correspondence and communications of J. Edward Jones with any State authority relating to the distribution of Participation Trust Certificates in J. Edward Jones Royalty Trust, Series 'M.\" \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n June 18, in a written communication to the commission, petitioner formally withdrew his application for registration, assigning as a reason, among others, that the commission's action had been given widespread publicity and placed him in a situation to be severely damaged. The same day, his counsel appeared before the examiner for the commission and presented this written withdrawal, which was marked for identification, but excluded from consideration. On June 27, counsel for petitioner appeared again before the examiner, and filed a dismissal signed by petitioner dismissing 'his registration statement heretofore filed' and withdrawing 'all application for consideration thereof or action thereon.' At the same time, petitioner's counsel filed a motion to dismiss and for an order from the commission permitting the withdrawal of the registration statement and dismissing the registration proceeding and all matters pertaining thereto at petitioner's cost, and also a motion to quash the subpoena which had been issued and served on petitioner. The examiner acting for the commission denied the motions and refused to allow the withdrawal, no reason for his action being assigned. In so doing, the commission and its examiner assumed to act under and in conformity with a regulation of the commission which provides as follows: 'Any registration statement or any amendment thereto may be withdrawn upon the request of the registrant if the Commission consents thereto. The fee paid upon the filing of such registration statement shall not be returned to the registrant. The papers comprising the registration statement or amendment thereto shall not be removed from the files of the Commission but shall be plainly marked with the date of the giving of such consent and in the following manner: 'Withdrawn upon the Request of the Registrant, the Commission consenting \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n thereto'. Such consent shall be given by the Commission with due regard to the public interest and the protection of investors.'\n On June 28th, petitioner filed with the court below a petition asking for a review of the commission's rulings which that court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. A petition for a writ of certiorari to review that action was denied by this court. \n297 \nU.S. 699\n, 56 S.Ct. 497.\n July 3, 1935, the commission filed an application in a Federal District Court for an order requiring petitioner to appear before the examiner to give evidence in the matter of petitioner's registration statement. Petitioner appeared and challenged, among other things, the validity of the orders of the commission denying petitioner's right to withdraw his registration statement, overruling his motions to withdraw and dismiss the proceedings and refusing to quash the subpoena which had been issued and served on petitioner. The District Court denied petitioner's contentions and entered an order directing him to appear before the commission at a time and place fixed, to testify in the matter of the registration statement and to answer all pertinent questions regarding the information and documents filed by him with the commission in respect of such statement. 12 F.Supp. 210. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed this order. 79 F.(2d) 617.\n The principal points urged by petitioner as ground for reversing the judgment below, and the only ones that need be stated, are as follows: That the commission was bound as matter of law to sustain petitioner's withdrawal and motion to withdraw the registration statement; that the right to withdraw such statement under the circumstances disclosed was unqualified; that the commission, therefore, was without authority to require petitioner to appear and testify or to submit his private books, records, and papers for the inspection of the com- \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n mission; that the Securities Act is unconstitutional, because it constitutes an attempt to exercise powers reserved to the states; and that it finds no warrant in either the commerce clause or in the power to regulate the use of the mails under the constitutional authority to establish post offices and post roads, or in any other provision of the Federal Constitution.\n First. By section 8(d), when it appears to the commission that any untrue statement of a material fact has been made in the registration statement, or material facts have been omitted which are required or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the commission may institute an inquiry to determine whether a stop order shall issue suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement. Proceeding under that section, as we have seen, the commission, before the registration statement was to become effective by the terms of section 8(a ), directed that a stop-order proceeding be instituted, and caused to be served on petitioner a telegraphic notice fixing a time for him to 'appear and show cause why a stop order should not be issued suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement.'\n Such a proceeding is analogous to a suit in equity to obtain an injunction, and should be governed by like considerations. Applying those considerations, then, what was the status of the registration statement pending the inquiry under section 8(d)? Notwithstanding the provision of section 8(a), that the effective date of a registration statement shall be the twentieth day after it is fi ed, did this intervening action of the commission nevertheless have the effect of suspending the effective operation of the statement pending the hearing and determination of the stop-order proceeding? We are of opinion that it did have that effect. The rule is well settled, both by the courts of England and of this country, that where a suit is brought to enjoin certain acts or activities, for example, \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n the erection of a building or other structure, of which suit the defendant has notice, the hands of the defendant are effectually tied pending a hearing and determination, even though no restraining order or preliminary injunction be issued. We briefly review some of the decisions.\n In Daniel v. Ferguson, L.R.(1891) 2 Ch. 27, suit had been brought to restrain defendant from building so as to darken plaintiff's lights. Notice of motion for a temporary injunction to be made upon a designated future day was served on the defendant. After receiving notice, the defendant put on a large number of men and proceeded with his building, running a wall up to a height of about 39 feet from the ground before the injunction was granted. The court, without regard to the ultimate rights of the parties, held that the wall thus run up by defendant should be torn down at once, as an attempt to anticipate the order of the court. A like situation was presented in Von Joel v. Hornsey, L.R.(1895) 2 Ch. 774. In that case, the evidence showed that defendant had repeatedly evaded attempts to serve him with process, and in the meantime had gone on with the building. Again, without regard to the ultimate rights of the parties, the court directed defendant to pull down that part of the building thus erected.\n The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in several cases has followed the same rule. Clark v. Martin, 49 Pa. 289, 298, 299; Easton, S.E. & W.E. Pass. Ry. Co. v. Easton, 133 Pa. 505, 519, 19 A. 486, 19 Am.St.Rep. 658; Cooke v. Boynton, 135 Pa. 102, 19 A. 944; Meigs v. Milligan, 177 Pa. 66, 72, 76, 35 A. 600; Fredericks v. Huber, 180 Pa. 572, 575, 37 A. 90. In Cooke v. Boynton, a bill in equity had been filed praying for a preliminary and perpetual injunction preventing defendants from interfering with a certain tramway of the plaintiff. Before a preliminary injunction was obtained, the defendants, on three separate occasions, had \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n torn up the track which the plaintiffs had replaced. The third incident occurred while plaintiff was obtaining a preliminary injunction. The court said: 'The writ was served just as they had finished the work of demolition, and this coincidence is strongly suggestive of a race against the law.' The trial court had dissolved the injunction, in part on the ground that the act sought to be restrained had already been done, and that it was without power at that stage of the cause to restore the property to its former condition by mandatory injunction. The Supreme Court reversed. 'What we did in the Easton Case,' the court said, 135 Pa. 102, at page 110, 19 A. 944, 'we will do here. We will restore the injunction, without passing upon the merits of the case. They will be considered when it comes here upon final hearing.'\n In New Haven Clock Co. v. Kochersperger, 175 Ill. 383, 51 N.E. 629, the State Supreme Court held that the forced payment of a tax after the court has acquired jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin its collection may be restored by the court, even though no preliminary injunction was granted; and that such payment cannot be availed of as a defense upon the ground that the tax having been paid there is nothing to enjoin. The same court in Turney v. Shriver, 269 Ill. 164, 172, 109 N.E. 708, 711, held the rule to be that, 'where a bill for an injunction has been filed, and the court has acquired jurisdiction of both the person and the subject-matter of the suit, and the defendant does any act which the bill seeks to enjoin, such party acts at his peril and subject to the power of the court to compel a restoration of the status.' See, also, Konig v. ity of Baltimore, 126 Md. 606, 627, 95 A. 478.\n The conclusion to be drawn from all the cases is that after a defendant has been notified of the pendency of a suit seeking an injunction against him, even though a temporary injunction be not granted, he acts at his \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n peril and subject to the power of the court to restore the status, wholly irrespective of the merits as they may be ultimately decided. 1 High on Injunctions (4th Ed.),  5(a).\n We hold the principle of this rule to be applicable to the present case. When proceedings were instituted by the commission and the registrant was notified and called upon to show cause why a stop order should not be issued, the practical effect was to suspend, pending the inquiry, all action of the registrant under his statement. Unless the registration statement is effective, the issuer of a security who makes use of the mails or of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce to sell the security or to carry the same for the purposes of sale or delivery after sale (section 5(a) of the act, 15 U.S.C.A.  77e(a), is liable to severe penalties of fine and imprisonment. Section 24, 15 U.S.C. A.  77x. The word 'effective,' as here employed, connotes completeness of operative force and freedom to act. And a registration statement which, while still in fieri, is brought under official challenge in respect of its validity and subjected to an official proceeding aimed at its destruction, cannot be so characterized until the challenge is determined in favor of the registrant. In the meantime, since he can act only at his peril, the registration statement can in no real sense be called effective.\n Second. In this situation, does a registrant have the unqualified right to withdraw his registration statement or, in other words, to dismiss a pending proceeding by which, for his own advantage, he is seeking the use of the mails and the instrumentalities of interstate commerce? If he have such right, there is no basis for the exercise of discretion in respect of the matter on the part of the commission; for it is obvious that discretion does not exist where there is no power to act except in one way. Cf. City of Detroit v. Detroit City Ry. Co. (C.C.) 55 F. 569, 573; Ex parte Skinner & Eddy Corp., \n265 \nU.S. 86, 93\n, 44 S.Ct. 446. \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n The act contains no provision upon the subject; and it may not be construed as attempting to confer upon the commission an arbitrary power, under rule or otherwise, to deny, without reason, a motion to dismiss. We are unable to find any precedent for the assumption of such power on the part of an administrative body; and we go to the practice and rules of the courts in order to determine by analogy the scope and limit of the power; for, at least in the absence of a statute to the contrary, the power of a commission to refuse to dismiss a proceeding on motion of the one who instituted it cannot be greater than the power which may be exercised by the judicial tribunals of the land under similar circumstances. Both parties here seem to recognize the appositeness of this test.\n The general rule is settled for the federal tribunals that a plaintiff possesses the unqualified right to dismiss his complaint at law or his bill in equity unless some plain legal prejudice will result to the defendant other than the mere prospect of a second litigation upon the subject matter. Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Central Transportation Co., \n171 \nU.S. 138, 145\n, 146 S., 18 S.Ct. 808. In announcing the rule, this court approved and cited as authority the decision rendered by Chief Justice Taft, then circuit judge, in City of Detroit v. Detroit City Ry. Co. (C.C.) 55 F. 569, 572. The opinion in the latter case, reviewing the English and American authorities, states the rule as follows: 'It is very clear from an examination of the authorities, English and American, that the right of a complainant to dismiss his bill without prejudice, on payment of costs, was of course except in certain cases. ... The exception was where a dismissal of the bill would prejudice the defendants in some other way than by the mere prospect of being harassed and vexed by future litigation of the same kind.' \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n Chicago & A.R.R. Co. v. Union Rolling-Mill Co., \n109 U.S. 702\n, 713-715, 3 S. Ct. 594; Barrett v. Virginian Ry. Co., \n250 \nU.S. 473, 476\n, 39 S.Ct. 540; McGowan v. Columbia River Packers' Ass'n, \n245 \nU.S. 352, 358\n, 38 S.Ct. 129; Veazie v. Wadleigh, 11 Pet. 55, 61, 62; Confiscation Cases, 7 Wall. 454, 457, 458.\n The foregoing decisions, together with others, are reviewed in an opinion delivered by Chief Justice Taft in Ex parte Skinner & Eddy Corp., \n265 \nU.S. 86\n, 44 S.Ct. 446, 448, and the conclusion stated as follows:\n'The right to dismiss, if it exists, is absolute. It does not depend on the reasons which the plaintiff offers for his action. The fact that he may not have disclosed all his reasons, or may not have given the real one, cannot affect his right.\n\n'The usual ground for denying a complainant in equity the right to dismiss his bill without prejudice at his own costs is that the cause has proceeded so far that the defendant is in a position to demand on the pleadings an opportunity to seek affirmative relief and he would be prejudiced by being remitted to a separate action. Having been put to the trouble of getting his counter case properly pleaded and ready, he may insist that the cause proceed to a decree. ...\n\n'The government had not, when the case was dismissed, given any time or expense to the preparation and filing of a cross-bill or of the evidence to sustain it. It had not taken any action in respect to the cause which entitled it to say that it would be prejudiced by a dismissal within the meaning of the authorities. It suddenly was awakened by the motion to dismiss to the fact that by eighteen months' delay it was losing a possible opportunity to litigate a cross-claim in the Court of Claims and without a jury. We think the same rule should obtain in the procedure of the Court of Claims as in federal courts of law and equity in respect to the dismissal of cases without prejudice.' \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n The commission apparently concedes that in the absence of a regulation to the contrary, the foregoing general rule would be applicable. The commission, however, relying upon our recent decision in Bronx Brass Foundry, Inc., v. Irving Trust Co., \n297 \nU.S. 230\n, 56 S.Ct. 451, 452 (February 10, 1936), contends that its regulation, quoted ante, justifies the adverse action of the commission. In the Brass Foundry Case, proof of a claim in bankruptcy had been filed. The trustee in bankruptcy moved to expunge the claim on the ground that the creditor had received certain payments on account which constituted unlawful preferences. Several hearings were held before the referee, and the evidence indicated that the contention of the trustee was well founded. Before the hearing closed, the creditor filed a withdrawal of its claim and abandoned the hearing. The trustee insisted that it was entitled to an adjudication whether the payments made were unlawful preferences. The referee refused to permit a withdrawal of the claim; and his action was approved by the District Court, and its judgment in turn affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals having jurisdiction. We affirmed, holding that the general rule as stated in Ex parte Skinner & Eddy Corp., supra, had been modified by a rule of the district court which authorized the court to refuse, after issue joined, 'to permit the plaintiff to discontinue even though the defendant cannot have affirmative relief under the pleadings and though his only prejudice be the vexation and expense of a possible second suit upon the same cause of action.'\n\n Assuming, without deciding, that the regulation of the commission was within its power and in force, it differs essentially from the foregoing rule of the district court. As applied to this pr ceeding in which there are no adversary parties, the regulation does not restrict the commonlaw rule. That rule, as we have seen is, that the right to dismiss is unqualified unless the dismissal would legally prejudice the defendants in some other \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n way than by future litigation of the same kind. The regulation is: 'Any registration statement or any amendment thereto may be withdrawn upon the request of the registrant if the commission consents thereto. ... Such consent shall be given by the commission with due regard to the public interest and the protection of investors.' This regulation is quite as general as the rule of the common law, and the possibility that the same registration may be attempted in the future is not within its terms any more than it is within the terms of the common-law rule. The question under the regulation is whether due regard to the public interest and the protection of investors requires that the withdrawal be denied. The test is the absence or presence of prejudice to the public or investors; and, plainly enough, under the decisions of this court, the doctrine that a dismissal must be granted if no prejudice be shown beyond the prospect of another suit, unless there be a specific rule of court to the contrary, is applicable, and the withdrawal should have been allowed as of course.\n We are unable to find anything in the record, the arguments of the commission, or the decision of the court below that suggests the possibility of any prejudice to the public or investors beyond the assumption, as put by the court below (79 F.(2d) 617, at page 620), that 'an unlimited privilege of withdrawal would have the effect of allowing registrants whose statements are defective, to withdraw before a stop order was issued and then to submit another statement with slight changes.'\n In this proceeding, there being no adversary parties, the filing of the registration statement is in effect an ex parte application for a license to use the mails and the facilities of interstate commerce for the purposes recognized by the act. We are unable to see how any right of the general public can be affected by the withdrawal of such an application before it has gone into effect. Peti- \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n tioner emphatically says that no steps had been taken looking to the issue of the securities; and this is not denied. So far as the record shows, there were no investors, existing or potential, to be affected. The conclusion seems inevitable that an abandonment of the application was of no concern to anyone except the registrant. The possibility of any other interest in the matter is so shadowy, indefinite, and equivocal that it must be put out of consideration as altogether unreal. Under these circumstances, the right of the registrant to withdraw his application would seem to be as absolute as the right of any person to withdraw an ungranted application for any other form of privilege in respect of which he is at the time alone concerned.\n An additional reason why the action of the commission and of the court below cannot be sustained is that the commission itself had challenged the integrity of the registration statement and invited the registrant to show cause why its effectiveness should not be suspended. In the face of such an invitation, it is a strange conclusion that the registrant is powerless to elect to save himself the trouble and expense of a contest by withdrawing his application. Such a withdrawal accomplishes everything which a stop order would accomplish, as counsel for the commission expressly conceded at the bar. And, as the court below very properly recognized, a withdrawal of the registration statement 'would end the effect of filing it and there is no authority under section 19(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  77s, subd. (b), to issue the commission subpoena and it could not be enforced by order of the District Court under section 22(b ) (15 U.S.C.A.  77v(b)).' 79 F.(2d) 617, 619.\n The action of the commission finds no support in right principle or in law. I is wholly unreasonable and arbitrary. It violates the cardinal precept upon which the constitutional safeguards of personal liberty ultimately rest-that this shall be a government of laws-because to the precise extent that the mere will of an official or \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n an official body is permitted to take the place of allowable official discretion or to supplant the standing law as a rule of human conduct, the government ceases to be one of laws and becomes an autocracy. Against the threat of such a contingency the courts have always been vigilant, and, if they are to perform their constitutional duties in the future, must never cease to be vigilant, to detect and turn aside the danger at its beginning. The admonition of Mr. Justice Bradley in Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n, 6 S.Ct. 524, 535, should never be forgotten: 'It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. ... It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon. Their motto should be obsta principiis.'\n Arbitrary power and the rule of the Constitution cannot both exist. They are antagonistic and incompatible forces; and one or the other must of necessity perish whenever they are brought into conflict. To borrow the words of Mr. Justice Day, 'there is no place in our constitutional system for the exercise of arbitrary power.' Garfield v. U.S. ex rel. Goldsby, \n211 \nU.S. 249, 262\n, 29 S.Ct. 62, 66. To escape assumptions of such power on the part of the three primary departments of the government, is not enough. Our institutions must be kept free from the appropriation of unauthorized power by lesser agencies as well. And if the various administrative bureaus and commissions, necessarily called and being called into existence by the increasing complexities of our modern business and political affairs, are permitted gradually to extend their powers by encroachments-even petty encroachments-upon the fundamental rights, privileges and immunities of the people, we shall in the end, while avoiding the \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n fatal consequences of a supreme autocracy, become submerged by a multitude of minor invasions of personal rights, less destructive but no less violative of constitutional guaranties.\n Third. The proceeding for a stop order having thus disappeared, manifestly it cannot serve as a basis for the order of the district court compelling petitioner to appear, give testimony, and produce his private books and papers for inspection by the commission. But the commission contends that the order may rest upon the general power to conduct investigations which it says is conferred by section 19(b). The difficulty with that is that the investigation was undertaken for the declared and sole purpose of determining whether a stop order should issue. The first action taken by the commission was on May 20th, four days before the registration was to become effective under the statute. The commission then, after averring that upon reasonable grounds it believed the registration statement was false in material facts, directed that stop- order proceedings be instituted against the statement. It never has averred or directed anything else. This action was followed by a notice containing like recitals of a more detailed character, and calling upon the registrant to appear and show cause why a stop order should not be issued suspending the effectiveness of the statement. It was upon this direction and notice that all subsequent proceedings were had and upon which they must stand or fall. We do not interpret the order of the district court, the substance of which has already been stated, as resting upon a different view.\n Nothing appears in any of the proceedings taken by the commission to warrant the suggestion that the in estigation was undertaken or would be carried on for any other purpose or to any different end than that specifically named. An official inquisition to compel disclosures of fact is not an end, but a means to an end; and it is \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n a mere truism to say that the end must be a legitimate one to justify the means. The citizen, when interrogated about his private affairs, has a right before answering to know why the inquiry is made; and if the purpose disclosed is not a legitimate one, he may not be compelled to answer. Since here the only disclosed purpose for which the investigation was undertaken had ceased to be legitimate when the registrant rightfully withdrew his statement, the power of the commission to proceed with the inquiry necessarily came to an end. Dissociated from the only ground upon which the inquiry had been based, and no other being specified, further pursuit of the inquiry, obviously, would become what Mr. Justice Holmes characterized as 'a fishing expedition ... for the chance that something discreditable might turn up' (Ellis v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n237 \nU.S. 434, 445\n, 35 S.Ct. 645, 647)-an undertaking which uniformly has met with judicial condemnation. In re Pacific Ry. Comm. (C.C.) 32 F. 241, 250; Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168, 190\n, 192 S., 193, 195, 196; Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S.Ct. 524; Harriman v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n211 \nU.S. 407, 419\n, 29 S.Ct. 115; Federal Trade Comm. v. American Tobacco Co., \n264 U.S. 298\n, 305- 307, 44 S.Ct. 336, 32 A.L.R. 786.\n In re Pacific Ry. Comm. involved the power of a congressional commission to investigate the private affairs, books, and papers of officers and employees of certain corporations indebted to the government. That commission called before it the president of one of these corporations, required the production of private books and papers for inspection, and submitted interrogatories which the witness declined to answer. Acting under the statute, the commission sought a peremptory order from the circuit court to compel the witness to answer the interrogatories. The court, consisting of Mr. Justice Field, Circuit Judge Sawyer, and District Judge Sabin, denied the motion of the district attorney for the order \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n and discharged the rule to show cause. Opinions were rendered seriatim, the principal one by Justice Field. The authority of the commission was definitely denied. That decision has frequently been cited and approved by this court. Judge Sawyer, in the course of his opinion (32 F. 241, at page 263), after observing that a bill in equity seeking a discovery upon general, loose, and vague allegations is styled 'a fishing bill,' and will, at once, be dismissed on that ground (Story, Eq.Pl.  325), said: 'A general, roving, offensive, inquisitorial, compulsory investigation, conducted by a commission without any allegations, upon no fixed principles, and governed by no rules of law, or of evidence, and no restrictions except its own will, or caprice, is unknown to our constitution and laws; and such an inquisition would be destructive of the rights of the citizen, and intolerable tyranny. Let the power once be established, and there is no knowing where the practice under it would end.'\n The fear that some malefactor may go unwhipped of justice weighs as nothing against this just and strong condemnation of a practice so odious. And, indeed, the fear itself has little of substance upon which to rest. The federal courts are open to the government; and the grand jury abides as the appropriate constitutional medium for the preliminary investigation of crime and the presentment of the accused for trial.\n The philosophy that constitutional limitations and legal restraints upon official action may be brushed aside upon the plea that good, perchance, may follow, finds no countenance in the American system of government. An investigation not based upon specified grounds is quite as objectionable as a search warrant not based up on specific statements of fact. Such an investigation, or such a search, is unlawful in its inception and cannot be made lawful by what it may bring, or by what it actually succeeds in bringing, to light. Cf. Byars v. United States, \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n \n273 \nU.S. 28, 29\n, 47 S.Ct. 248, and cases cited. If the action here of the commission be upheld, it follows that production and inspection may be enforced not only of books and private papers of the guilty, but those of the innocent as well, notwithstanding the proceeding for registration, so far as the power of the commission is concerned, has been brought to an end by the complete and legal withdrawal of the registration statement.\n Exercise of 'such a power would be more pernicious to the innocent than useful to the public'; and approval of it must be denied, if there were no other reason for denial, because, like an unlawful search for evidence, it falls upon the innocent as well as upon the guilty and unjustly confounds the two. Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howell, St.Tr. 1030, 1074, followed by this court in Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 629\n, 630 S., 6 S.Ct. 524. No one can read these two great opinions, and the opinions in the Pacific Ry. Comm. Case, from which the foregoing quotation is made, without perceiving how closely allied in principle are the three protective rights of the individual-that against compulsory self- accusation, that against unlawful searches and seizures, and that against unlawful inquisitorial investigations. They were among those intolerable abuses of the Star Chamber, which brought that institution to an end at the hands of the Long Parliament in 1640. Even the shortest step in the direction of curtailing one of these rights must be halted in limine, lest it serve as a precedent for further advances in the same direction, or for wrongful invasions of the others.\n Fourth. The foregoing disposes of the case and requires a reversal of the judgment of the lower court. In that view, it becomes unnecessary to consider the constitutional validity of the act.\n Reversed. \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting.\n I am unable to concur in the opinion of the court.\n A subpoena duces tecum was issued by the commission on June 13 before any attempt had been made to withdraw the registration statement. On June 18, the day of the attempted withdrawal, there was issued a second subpoena commanding the registrant to appear and testify, and this was served upon him by the marshal. Then and for months earlier a standing regulation gave warning to him and to the world that without the consent of the commission there could be no withdrawal of a statement once placed upon the files. I am persuaded that the rule is valid; that the commission had abundant reasons for maintaining jurisdiction; and that notice of withdrawal did not nullify the writ.\n The subpoena flouted by the witness was issued under section 19(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  77s(b), of the statute as well as under section 8(e), 15 U.S. C.A.  77h(e). So the sworn petition for commission explicitly informs us. It was issued in aid of any legitimate inquiry that the commission had authority to initiate and prosecute by reason of a false and defective statement then part of the official records. Nothing in the case gives color to the argument that the witness was to be subjected to a roving examination without the restraints of pleadings or bounds analogous thereto. On the contrary, the order of the District Court upholding the subpoena directs him to make answer to questions pertinent to the documents already filed with the commission, to these and nothing more. If the petitioner is to prevail in his attack upon the writ, it will have to be on broader grounds than those of form and method. He must be able to make good his argument that by the mere announcement of withdrawal, he achieved results analogous to those of a writ of prohibition. \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 30]\n\u00a0\n Recklessness and deceit do not automatically excuse themselves by notice of repentance. Under section 24 of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  77x, there is the possibility, at times the likelihood, of penal liability. A statement willfully false or willfully defective is a penal offense to be visited, upon conviction, with fine or imprisonment. Under section 12, 15 U.S.C.A.  77l, there is the possibility, if not the likelihood, of liability for damages. The statement now in question had been effective for over twenty days, and the witness did not couple his notice of withdrawal with an affidavit or even a declaration that securities had not been sold. Nor is the statute lacking in machinery with which to set these liabilities in motion upon appropriate occasion. Under section 19(b), 15 U. S.C.A.  77s(b), plenary authority is conferred on the commission to conduct all investigations believed to be necessary and proper for the enforcement of the act and of any of its provisions. There will be only partial attainment of the ends of public justice unless retribution for the past is added to prevention for the future. But the opinion of the court teaches us that however flagrant the offense and however laudable the purpose to uncover and repress it, investigations under section 19(b) will be thwarted on the instant when once the statement of the registrant has been effectively withdrawn. If that is so, or even indeed if the effect of the retraction is to embarrass the inquiry-to cloud the power to continue-the fairness of the rule is proved out of the mouths of its accusers. If such consequences are inherent in a privilege of withdrawal indiscriminately bestowed, there is need of some restraint upon the power of the wrongdoer to mitigate the penalties attaching to his wrong. Shall the truth be shown forth or buried in the archives? The commission is to determine in the light of all the circumstances, including its information as to the conduct of the applicant, whether the public interest will be prompted by forgetting and forgiving. Bronx Brass Foundry, Inc., v. Irving Trust Co., \n297 \nU.S. 230\n, 56 S.Ct. 451, February 10, 1936. \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n The objection is inadequate that an investigation directed to the discovery of a crime is one not for the commission, but for the prosecuting officer. There are times when the functions of the two will coincide or overlap. Congress has made it plain that any inquiry helpful in the enforcement of the statute may be pursued by the commission, though conduct punishable as a crime may thereby be uncovered. Indeed, the act is explicit (section 22(c), 15 U.S.C.A.  77v(c) that a witness is not excused from testifying on the ground that the testimony required of him may tend to incriminate him or expose him to a penalty or forfeiture. He may, however, claim his privilege, and if then compelled to testify, may not be prosecuted thereafter for any matter thus revealed. All this is far from proving that there can be no practical advantage in keeping the proceeding open. Aside from the possibility of civil liability, the offender may not choose to claim the privilege, and even if he does and is then excused from testifying, other witnesses may be available, for example, employes, who are not implicated in the offense and who can bring the facts to view. Moreover, amnesty for one offender may mean conviction for another, an associate in the crime. Inquiry by the commission is thus more penetrating and efficient than one by a grand jury where there is no statutory grant of amnesty to compel confederates to speak. More important still, the enforcement of the act is aided when guilt is exposed to the censure of the world, though the witness in the act of speaking may make punishment impossible. It is no answer to all this that upon the record now presented a crime has not been proved or even definitely charged. An investigator is not expected to prove or charge at the beginning the offenses which he has reason to suspect will be uncovered at the end. The petition in behalf of the commission enumerates one by one the false statements and the omissions imputed to the registrant. Some at least are of \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n such a nature that if chargeable to him at all, they can hardly have been made otherwise than with criminal intent. To give the investigating officer an opportunity to reach down into the hidden wells of knowledge and the more hidden wells of motive is the very purpose of the regulation by which the proceeding is kept open after the registrant has tried to end it.\n The opinion of the court reminds us of the dangers that wait upon the abuse of power by officialdom unchained. The warning is so fraught with truth that it can never be untimely. But timely too is the reminder, as a host of impoverished investors will be ready to attest, that there are dangers in untruths and half truths when certificates masquerading as securities pass current in the market. There are dangers in spreading a belief that untruths and half truths, designed to be passed on for the guidance of confiding buyers, are to be ranked as peccadillos, or even perhaps as part of the amenities of business. When wrongs such as these have been committed or attempted, they must be dragged to light and pilloried. To permit an offending registrant to stifle an inquiry by precipitate retreat on the eve of his exposure is to give immunity to guilt; to encourage falsehood and evasion; to invite the cunning and unscrupulous to gamble with detection. If withdrawal without leave may check investigation before securities have been issued, it may do as much thereafter, unless indeed consistency be thrown to the winds, for by the teaching of the decision withdrawal without leave is equivalent to a stop order, with the result that forthwith there is nothing to investigate. The statute and its sanctions become the sport of clever knaves.\n Appeal is vaguely made to some constitutional immunity, whether express or implied is not stated with distinctness. It cannot be an immunity from the unreasonable search or seizure of papers or effects: the books and documents of the witness are unaffected by the challenged \n\n[298 U.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n order. It cannot be an immunity from impertinent intrusion into matters of strictly personal concern: the intimacies of private business lose their self-regarding quality after they have been spread upon official records to induce official action. In such circumstances the relevance of Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howell, St.Tr. 1030, 1074, or Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 629\n, 6 S.Ct. 524, or the Matter of the Pacific Railway Commission (C.C.) 32 F. 241, 250, is not readily perceived. Cf. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447, 469\n, 478 S., 14 S.Ct. 1125. If the immunity rests upon some express provision of the Constitution, the opinion of the court does not point us to the article or section. If its source is to be found in some impalpable essence, the spirit of the Constitution or the philosophy of government favored by the Fathers, one may take leave to deny that there is anything in that philosophy or spirit whereby the signer of a statement filed with a regulatory body to induce official action is protected against inquiry into his own purpose to deceive. The argument for immunity lays hold of strange analogies. A commission which is without coercive powers, which cannot arrest or amerce or imprison though a crime has been uncovered or even punish for contempt, but can only inquire and report, the propriety of every question in the course of the inquiry being subject to the supervision of the ordinary courts of justice, is likened with denunciatory fervor to the Star Chamber of the Stuarts. Historians may find hyperbole in the sanguinary simile.\n The rule now assailed was wisely conceived and lawfully adopted to foil the plans of knaves intent upon obscuring or suppressing the knowledge of their knavery.\n The witness was under a duty to respond to the subpoena.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOSE RIVERA SOLER & CO. v. UNITED FIREMEN'S INS. CO.(1936)\nNo. 31\nArgued: October 20, 1936Decided: November 9, 1936\n\n\n\n Mr. Francis H. Dexter, of San Juan, P.R., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Henri Brown, of San Juan, P.R., and Carroll G. Walter, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[299 U.S. 45, 46]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, the insurance company, issued to petitioner a $30,000 fire policy covering certain personalty in Puerto Rico, distributed thus: $ 15,000 on stock of merchandise, unembroidered, embroidered and in the process of being embroidered, or for repairs, and on cost of labor performed thereon, including, etc.; $12,000 on machinery of every description, etc.; $3,000 on furniture, fixtures, etc.\n After a fire petitioner presented sworn proof of loss exceeding $35, 000 and demanded payment of the full amount of the policy. This was refused. It then brought this action in the District Court of the United States for Puerto Rico to recover the sum demanded with interest. Claiming that the assured had acted fraudulently and had failed to comply with specified conditions, the company denied any liability. There was a verdict for $17,000 plus interest; an appropriate judgment followed. A bill of exceptions also ten assignments of error were filed, and the cause went to the Circuit Court of Appeals, First Circuit. 81 F.(2d) 385.\n That court, having heard the matter, affirmed the challenged judgment, May 25, 1935 (77 F.(2d) 891, 892). The supporting opinion of that date states: 'The defenses now relied upon rest upon breaches of what are commonly referred to as 'conditions subsequent'; the real defense being that the plaintiff's claim was essentially fraudulent. The provisions of the policy relied on in defense are the so-called 'Iron Safe' clause and condition 12.'\n The 'Iron Safe' clause requires the assured to keep 'a complete itemized inventory of stock on hand,' and 'a set of books, which shall clearly and plainly present a complete record of business transacted, including all purchases, sales and shipments'; also that these shall be 'securely locked in a fireproof safe at night,' etc. \n\n[299 U.S. 45, 47]\n\u00a0\n Condition 12 provides: 'If the claim be in any respect fraudulent, or if any false declaration be made or used in support thereof, or if any fraudulent means or devices are used by the Insured or anyone acting on his behalf to obtain any benefit under this policy; ... all benefit under this policy shall be forfeited.'\n The first seven assignments, relating to the failure of the trial judge to direct a verdict, also Nos. 8 and 9, were overruled.\n The eighth assignment assailed the refusal to instruct that no evidence tended to support the $2,524.50 item for cost of labor found in the proof of loss; the ninth challenged the failure to instruct that there was nothing from which the jury could determine the market value of certain merchandise said to have been sold to the assured by its president.\n Concerning the tenth assignment the court said: 'The value of the destroyed property as claimed by the plaintiff was about $34,000. The jury's verdict was for $17,000. The defendant contends that the verdict, fixing the value of the property at only about one half of what was claimed in the proof of loss, established as a matter of law that there was fraudulent overvaluation by the plaintiff in the proof of loss. Obviously, this question could not arise until after the verdict; it amounts to a contention that the verdict in favor of the plaintiff was inconsistent and contradictory to the finding on damages. Questions of this character should be presented in the first instance to the trial judge. He has never passed upon this point. No ruling of his upon it was excepted to; no exception relating to it appears in the record. We cannot consider it.'\n A rehearing was granted. A second judgment followed (January 7, 1936, 81 F. (2d) 385, 388) which vacated the earlier one and remanded the cause to the trial court 'with directions to enter an order in arrest of judgment, with costs to the \n\n[299 U.S. 45, 48]\n\u00a0\n appellant in both courts.' An opinion from which the judge who wrote the original one dissented, pointed out the reasons for the action taken. This considered only the tenth assignment of error and the one based upon failure to direct a verdict because no evidence tended to support the $2, 524.50 item for 'Labor on goods in process.' Assignments based upon alleged violations of the 'Iron Safe' clause were not discussed.\n The court said: 'Under the tenth assignment it is contended that the verdict and judgment are contrary to law; that the amount of the loss fixed by the verdict is so inconsistent with the proof of loss and the provisions of the policy, both of which are made a part of the pleadings, as to show that the plaintiff's sworn proof of loss was fraudulent as a matter of law.' 'Bills of exception are necessary to preserve exceptions to rulings made in the progress of the trial, but errors appearing on the face of the record proper need not be so preserved. In the court below the defendant could have made a motion in arrest of judgment, but no such motion was necessary.' 'In considering the question raised by the tenth assignment, the evidence introduced at the trial and brought here by bill of exceptions is not to be considered, for that is no part of the record proper. The inquiry is confined to such matters as appear in the record proper. That record in this case includes the complaint, proof of loss and the policy (which are included in the complaint), the verdict, and judgment.' 'It is perfectly plain that the verdict of the jury is entirely inconsistent with the allegations of the complaint and the proof of loss, and we think this disparity of nearly.$19,000 shows on its face and as a matter of law that the sworn proof of loss was fraudulent and, if so, then under the twelfth condition of the policy, all benefit thereunder was forfeited. The verdict should have been either for nothing, or in the neighborhood of $30,000.' \n\n[299 U.S. 45, 49]\n\u00a0\n Also: 'Under the motion for a directed verdict the evidence introduced at the trial and included in the bill of exceptions is open for consideration. There is no evidence in the case, and counsel for the plaintiff has pointed out none, though requested to do so, showing that the cost of labor 'on goods in process' was $2,524.50, as stated in the sworn proof of loss. The only evidence in the record relating to that subject is that given by Soler himself (president of the plaintiff company ), where he states that the sum of $2,524.50 was the contract price which the company was to receive for manufacturing the goods of others. If the statement in the proof of loss, to which Soler made oath, did not represent the cost of labor, but was the contract price which the plaintiff was to receive from others for whom goods were being manufactured, no other conclusion can reasonably be drawn than that the statement in the proof of loss was knowingly made for the purpose of getting money from the insurance company that the plaintiff was not entitled to and was fraudulent, and, under condition 12 of the policy, deprived the plaintiff of its benefits. Soler was the president of the plaintiff company and made oath to the proof of loss.'\n The second opinion holds in effect that fraud by the plaintiff conclusively appears on the face of the record without giving consideration to any evidence; also that fraud on its part with respect to the item 'Labor on goods in process' included in the proof of loss so clearly appeared from the evidence that the defendant was entitled to a directed verdict.\n We cannot accept the view that a conclusive presumption of fraud arose because the verdict was far less than the amount stated in the proof of loss. If the bill of exceptions be disregarded, we must assume the jury was properly instructed-were told that condition 12 required a verdict for the insurer 'if the claim be in any respect \n\n[299 U.S. 45, 50]\n\u00a0\n fraudulent.' The finding for the assured indicates that they discovered no fraud. Policyholders may present inaccurate proofs of loss without conscious dishonesty of intent to defraud; different views of values are common; memory is faulty; insurance company and assured often entertain widely different views concerning the policy; and evidence cannot always be produced to establish something declared to be true in entire good faith.\n For like reasons we cannot say the trial judge, even if he thought there was complete failure to sustain the item for 'Labor on goods in process,' should have ruled that this alone was enough to show fraud and required a directed verdict for the company. Condition No. 12 was read to the jury and declared to be 'legal and part of the conditions of the contract.' He also charged clearly enough that any dishonest claim made with intent to defraud would render the policy inoperative. Nevertheless the jury found for the assured. In these circumstances we cannot say there was a conclusive presumption of purpose to defraud.\n Although the court below, in its first opinion, clearly overruled assignments based upon the 'Iron Safe' clause and said nothing about them in the second, counsel insist that they are before us and adequate to support the questioned judgment. If, in the circumstances, they can be considered at all, it is enough to say that the jury was well instructed concerning the necessity of complying with that clause; the verdict negatives the notion of fraud. There was conflicting evidence; the weight to be given this was for them to determine.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed. We find no material error in the action of the District Court, and its judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKAMMERER v.

Code Ohio, 115 Ohio Laws 3, section 1 et seq., effective February 27, 1933, the Superintendent of Building and Loan Associations of the State of Ohio took possession of the assets of the above-mentioned associations, respectively, for the purpose of liquidation. The superintendent sought authority to borrow money from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to pay off claims alleged to be prior to the shareholders' claims against such associations and to pledge the assets as security. Appellant shareholders on behalf of all the shareholders of the respective associations, through their counsel, successfully opposed the superintendent's applications. Thereupon appellants filed applications for the allowance of their counsel fees and expenses out of the assets of the associations. The common pleas court of Montgomery county, on motion of the superintendent, struck these applications from the files upon the ground that under the Ohio statutes the court did not have jurisdiction to consider or allow such fees. Motions for new trial and rehearing were overruled. The Court of Appeals of Montgomery County sustained the ruling of the court of common pleas. Appellants then appealed as of right to the Supreme Court of Ohio, and that court dismissed the appeals on the ground that 'no debatable constitutional question' was involved. In re American Loan & Savings Ass'n, 131 Ohio St. 330, 2 N.E.(2d) 823.\n We find no basis for the contention that in denying appellants' claim to be paid their counsel fees and ex- \n\n[299 U.S. 302, 304]\n\u00a0\n penses out of the assets in the hands of the liquidator, upon the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to make such an allowance, any right of the appellants under the Federal Constitution has been infringed. The question is one of state practice and remedy. The motions to dismiss the appeals are granted and the appeals are dismissed for the want of a substantial federal question. Iowa Central R. Co. v.

Gen., for respondent. \n\n[298 U.S. 441, 442]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The writ of certiorari was granted (\n297 \nU.S. 702\n, 56 S.Ct. 669) in this case to resolve a conflict between the decision below1 and one by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The question is whether, under the Revenue Acts of 1926 (44 Stat. 9) and 1928 (45 Stat. 791), a taxpayer who purchases cumulative nonvoting preferred shares of a corporation upon which a dividend is subsequently paid in common voting shares must, upon a sale or other disposition of the preferred shares, apportion their cost between preferred and common for the purpose of determining gain or loss.\n The petitioner, in 1924 and 1926, purchased preferred stock of Columbia Steel Corporation. The company's articles of incorporation provided that holders of preferred stock should receive annual dividends of $7 a share in cash or, at the company's option, one share of common stock for each share of preferred. Dividends on the preferred were to be paid in full before any could be paid on the common; the common had voting rights, the preferred none. The preferred was redeemable at $105 per share, plus accrued dividends; and upon dissolution or liquidation was entitled to preferential payment of $100 per share, plus accrued dividends, and no more. The common alone was entitled in such event to the assets of the corporation remaining after payment of the preferred.\n In each of the years 1925 to 1928, inclusive, the company had a surplus sufficient to pay the preferred dividends in cash, but elected to pay them in common stock. The petitioner received, in each of those years, shares of common stock as dividends on her preferred. In 1930 the corporation redeemed its preferred stock at $105 per \n\n[298 U.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n share. In computing the profit realized by the petitioner the Commissioner allocated to the common stock so received, in each instance, a proportionate amount of the cost of the preferred stock. He thereby decreased the resulting cost basis per share and ncreased the gain. The Board of Tax Appeals reversed holding that the dividends were taxable income, were not stock dividends within the meaning of the Revenue Acts,3 and their receipt did not reduce the cost basis of the preferred stock. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board and approved the Commissioner's action.\n The petitioner contends, first, that the dividends she received were not stock dividends exempted from taxation by the Revenue Acts; and, secondly, if exempted, they were none the less income and cannot be treated as returns of capital in computing capital gain or loss. The respondent answers that the distributions were stock dividends because made in the capital stock of the corporation and come within the plain meaning of the provisions exempting stock dividends from income tax; accordingly, the Treasury regulations have consistently and continuously treated them as returns of capital, and required the original cost to be apportioned between the shares originally acquired and those distributed as dividends to obtain the cost basis for the calculation of gain or loss. We hold that the dividends were income and may not be treated as returns of capital.\n The Revenue Act of 1913 imposed an income tax on dividends. \n4\n In Towne v. Eisner, \n245 \nU.S. 418\n, 38 S.Ct. 158, L.R.A. 1918D, 254, it was held that where a corporation declared a dividend on its common stock, in the form of common stock, the dividend was not income within the intendment of the act. \n\n[298 U.S. 441, 444]\n\u00a0\n The Revenue Act of 1916 provided that a stock dividend should be considered income to the amount of its cash value. \n5\n In Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189\n, 40 S.Ct. 189, 9 A.L.R. 1570, it was decided that a dividend in the corporation's common stock paid to the then common stockholders was not income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment and therefore the effort to tax such dividends exceeded the power granted by the Amendment. It was said that such a dividend was not income because, by its payment, no severance of corporate assets was accomplished and the pre-existing proportionate interests of the stockholders remained unaltered. After the decision the Treasury revoked regulations to the effect that a dividend paid in the corporation's stock is income and issued amended regulations, broadly phrased, to exempt all income in the form of stock dividends, whether the dividend shares be of the same class as those theretofore held by the stockholder or of a different class, and prescribing the method of allocating the original cost as between the old and the new stock for purposes of calculating gain or loss upon realization. Subsequently Congress adopted the Revenue Act of 1921 which provided, in section 201(d): 'A stock dividend shall not be subject to tax.' 6 The reason for the exemption was the decision in Eisner v. Macomber, supra. The reports of both the House and the Senate Committees dealing with the bill state that the act 'modifies the definition of dividends in existing law by exempting stock dividends from the income tax, as required by the decision of the Supreme Court in Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 U.S. 189\n ( 40 S.Ct. 189, 9 A.L.R. 1570).'7 \n\n[298 U.S. 441, 445]\n\u00a0\n Although Eisner v. Macomber affected only the axation of dividends declared in the same stock as that presently held by the taxpayer, the Treasury gave the decision a broader interpretation which Congress followed in the act of 1921. Soon after the passage of that act, this court pointed out the distinction between a stock dividend which worked no change in the corporate entity, the same interest in the same corporation being represented after the distribution by more shares of precisely the same character, and such a dividend where there had either been changes of corporate identity or a change in the nature of the shares issued as dividends whereby the proportional interest of the stockholder after the distribution was essentially different from his former interest. \n8\n Nevertheless the successive statutes and Treasury regulations respecting taxation of stock dividends remained unaltered. \n9\n We give great weight to an administrative interpretation long and consistently followed, particularly when the Congress, presumably with that construction in mind, has re-enacted the statute without change. \n10\n The question here, however, is not merely of our adopting the administrative construction, but whether it should be adopted if in effect it converts an income tax into a capital levy.\n We are dealing solely with an income tax act. Under our decisions the payment of a dividend of new common shares, conferring no different rights or interests than did the old, the new certificates, plus the old, representing the same proportionate interest in the net assets \n\n[298 U.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n of the corporation as did the old, does not constitute the receipt of income by the stockholder. On the other hand, where a stock dividend gives the stockholder an interest different from that which his former stock holding represented he receives income. The latter type of dividend is taxable as income under the Sixteenth Amendment. Whether Congress has taxed it as of the time of its receipt, is immaterial for present purposes.\n The relevant capital gains provisions of the Revenue Act of 1928 are section 111(a):\n'The gain from the sale or other disposition of property shall be the excess of the amount realized therefrom over the adjusted basis provided in section 113'11 and Section 113:\n\n'The basis for determining the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property acquired after February 28, 1913, shall be the cost of such property' (with exceptions having no relevancy here).12\n\n The property disposed of was the petitioner's preferred stock. In plain terms the statute directs the subtraction of its cost from the proceeds of its redemption, if the latter sum be the greater. But we are told that Treasury regulations13 long in force require an allocation of the original cost between the preferred stock purchased and the common stock received as dividend. And it is said that while no provision of the statute authorizes a specific regulation respecting this matter, the general power conferred by the law to make appropriate regulations comprehends the subject. Where the act uses ambiguous terms, or is of doubtful construction, a clarifying regulation or one indicating the method of its application to specific cases not only is permissible but is to be given great weight by the courts. And the same principle \n\n[298 U.S. 441, 447]\n\u00a0\n governs where the statute merely expresses a general rule and invests the Secretary of the Treasury with authority to promulgate regulations appropriate to its enforcement. But where, as in this case, the provisions of the act are unambiguous, and its directions specific, there is no power to amend it by regulation. \n14\n Congress having clearly and specifically declared that in taxing income arising from capital gain the cost of the asset disposed of shall by the measure of the income, the Secretary of the Treasury is without power by regulatory amendment to add a provision that income derived from the capital asset shall be used to reduce cost.\n The judgment is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO are of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.\n The meaning of the Act of Congress exempting stock dividends from taxation as income at the time of distribution has had a practical construction through administrative action and legislative acquiescence. Even though the meaning may have been uncertain in the beginning, it has now become fixed in accordance with long continued practice. Morrissey v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 344, 355\n, 56 S.Ct. 289; Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co., \n296 \nU.S. 378, 384\n, 56 S.Ct. 269. This is not denied in the opinion of the court. Congress did not intend, however, when it refused to tax the newly acquired shares as income in praesenti to exclude them from taxation in futuro if disposed of at a profit. A tax upon a gainful use either of capital or of income, when the gain is fully realized, is a true tax upon income and not a capital levy. The question is merely one as to how the profit shall be computed. Following the analogy \n\n[298 U.S. 441, 448]\n\u00a0\n of Miles v. Safe Deposit & Trust Co. of Baltimore, \n259 \nU.S. 247, 253\n, 42 S. Ct. 483, the cost of all the shares is properly distributed between the investment and its accretions, between the old shares and the new. The Regulations so provide.

LUTZ(1936)\nNo. 501\nArgued: December 7, 1936Decided: December 21, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Indiana.\n Messrs. Robert S. Marx and Frank E. Wood, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for appellant.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Complainant brought this suit to restrain the enforcement of an order of the Milk Control Board of the State of Indiana, made June 12, 1936, fixing selling prices of milk in the Fort Wayne Marketing Area. Upon the hearing by three judges (28 U.S.C.  380 (28 U.S.C.A.  380)) of a motion for a preliminary injunction, the District Court dismissed the cause for the want of jurisdiction upon the ground that the requisite jurisdictional amount was not involved. The court made the following findings:\n'2. That complainant owns and operates a chain of grocery stores in and out of Indiana, forty-four (44) of \n\n[299 U.S. 300, 301]\n\u00a0\n which are located in the City of Fort Wayne, and within a radius of seven ( 7) Miles thereof, and has invested in said stores in said Fort Wayne marketing area approximately Four Hunderd Fifty Thousand ($450,000.00) Dollars, making an annual sales of approximately Two Million ($2,000,000. 00) Dollars, of which said sales milk and dairy products amount to approximately Forty-five thousand ($45,000.00) Dollars. That the number of quarts of milk sold by said stores in one year period are less than 550, 000 in said area, in that complainant's profits per quart on its milk sold are .00398. That complainant's total loss in profits for a one-year period on a complete loss of its milk business would be Two Thousand Eighty-nine ($ 2089.00) Dollars, on the basis of 550,000 quarts. That if complainant be required by Official Order No. 14 of the Milk Control Board of Indiana to sell its milk at a level price with other dairies and distributors in said territory, its loss in the sales of milk would not exceed twenty-five percent, and its loss in profits would not exceed Five Hundred ($500.00) Dollars.\n\n'3. That on March 12th, 1935 chapter 281 of the Acts of the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, commonly known as the Milk Control Law, became effective, and that said Act expires by limitation on July 1st. 1937.'\n\n In granting a temporary stay pending appeal to this Court, the District Court found that the enforcement of the order would 'cause immediate and irreparable injury to the business of the complainant.'\n In determining whether the requisite jurisdictional amount is in controversy, where it does not appear that the complainant is deprived of its license or is prevented by the regulation from prosecuting its business, the question is not the value or net worth of the business, but the value of the right to be free from the regulation, and this may be measured by the loss, if any, that would follow the enforcement of the rule prescribed. McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, \n298 \nU.S. 178\n, 56 S.Ct. 780. \n\n[299 U.S. 300, 302]\n\u00a0\n In order to support its contention, complainant seeks to capitalize its earnings and thus to arrive at the value of the part of the business affected by the order. But that basis of ascertaining a capital loss is not available to complainant here, as the statute, and with it the order, expire by limitation on July 1, 1937. The hurt by reason of the regulation does not appear to be greater than the loss sustained while the statute is in operation. The decree of the District Court is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKVOS, INC. v. ASSOCIATED PRESS(1936)\nNo. 28\nArgued: November 11, 1936Decided: December 14, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 270]\n\u00a0\n Wm. H. Pemberton, of Olympia, Wash., and Clarence C. Dill, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. John W. Davis and William C. Cannon, both of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 271]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought to enjoin petitioner, the proprietor of a radio station at Bellingham, Wash., from appropriating, using, or disseminating news gathered by the respondent or its members during the period such news has commercial value to respondent and its members. The prayers were for temporary and permanent relief. The District Court directed the petitioner to show cause why an injunction should not be granted and entered a temporary restraining order.\n In summary, the allegations of the bill follow.\n Respondent is a New York corporation and petitioner a Washington corporation; 'the damage to which com- \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n plainant is being subjected ... is in excess of the sum of Three Thousand ($3000.00) Dollars, exclusive of interest and costs, and the amount involved herein and in controversy herein is in excess of said sum of Three Thousand ($3000.00) Dollars, exclusive of interest and costs.'\n The respondent, a membership corporation, is composed of proprietors or representatives of newspapers published throughout the United States whose business is the gathering, by its own instrumentalities, and by exchange with members, and other means, news, intelligence, and information from all over the world for the benefit of its members, and distribution of the material so gathered amongst them for newspaper publication, conformably to the bylaws.\n The respondent has representatives in every important capital and city in the world and has reciprocal arrangements for interchange of news with many important agencies in foreign countries; has more than twelve hundred members, each owning or representing a daily newspaper, each supplying respondent, as required by the by-laws, with the news gathered locally by the newspaper he represents; the cost of respondent's transactions, amounting yearly to many millions of dollars, is equitably divided among the members; the association's service to members is of financial and business importance to them, due to its promptness, accuracy, and impartiality; the by-laws require that the news furnished shall remain confidential until publication has been fully accomplished by all members.\n The petitioner conducts a radio station at Bellingham, Wash., and, as part of its daily broadcast, sends out, three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, what is styled 'The Newspaper of the Air' in which petitioner announces what it claims to be, and what usually is, the leading and most interesting news of the day. The Bellingham Herald, published at Bellingham, is a member of \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 273]\n\u00a0\n the association and, under the by-laws, the respondent is entitled to be furnished by the Herald with all the news from the territory served by that paper; the Seattle Post Intelligencer and the Seattle Daily Times are published at Seattle, Wash., and are represented by memberships in the association which has the same rights to news gathered by those papers.\n The petitioner broadcasts news as part of its business and, by so doing, enhances the profits obtained from advertising broadcasts; the newspapers affiliated with the respondent derive a large portion of their revenues from the sale of advertising space, the value of which depends in great measure upon the freshness and interest of the news furnished by them. The petitioner, in the conduct of its station, has become, and is, a competitor of respondent and its members in the obtaining and early distribution of news, for the purpose of popularizing advertising.\n The petitioner has no organization of its own for gathering news, but adopts the practice of 'pirating' news gathered by the respondent and its members. This practice consists in procuring copies of the Herald, the Post Intelligencer, and the Daily Times and broadcasting parts, or all, of items therein published, whether gathered by these newspapers or received by them from the respondent, the repetition being sometimes verbatim and sometimes a rearrangement of the wording. The copies of the three newspapers do not reach their subscribers for some time (in some cases as much as twenty-four hours) after publication; whereas petitioner, promptly obtaining the papers, is able to pirate and broadcast their contents and to anticipate the receipt of the news by the newspapers' subscribers. This practice constitutes unfair competition with the respondent; wrongfully deprives the respondent of the just benefits of its labors and expenditures; similar injures respondent's members; and prejudices the respondent with its members. \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 274]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner, though repeatedly requested to desist from the practice, has refused so to do, although neither the association nor any member has granted permission to make use of the news gathered by them; and the continuance by the petitioner of its practice will increasingly cause irreparable injury and damage to the respondent because the effort and expenditures to gather and obtain news will be rendered largely without reward or value so far as concerns the territory served by petitioner's station.\n Prior to the return day of the order to show cause why a temporary injunction should not issue, the petitioner filed a motion to dismiss, assigning the following grounds, amongst others: the bill fails to recite facts entitling the plaintiff to the relief prayed and is without equity; there is a nonjoinder of parties plaintiff since the bill discloses that the Bellingham Herald, Seattle Post Intelligencer, and Seattle Daily Times are necessary parties; the court is without jurisdiction because the matter in controversy does not exceed $3,000.00, exclusive of interest and costs, and an inspection of the allegations of the complaint shows the complainant cannot recover any amount in excess of $3,000.00 or any other amount and the sum named in the ad damnum clause of the complaint is not a true statement of complainant's damages and is not alleged in good faith, the facts being that the amount paid to the complainant for furnishing the Associated Press news in the city of Bellingham, to any of its members, is fixed and determined by the size of the city's population, and is not affected by any other condition and complainant has not lost any amount and never will lose any amount by reason of this controversy, and defendant is not a competitor of complainant in any sense of the word; the Bellingham Herald is the real party in interest and the Associated Press has no interest in the cause.\n Affidavits were presented in support of and in opposition to the granting of an injunction, and counsel were \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 275]\n\u00a0\n heard upon the prayer for preliminary injunction and upon the motion to dismiss. The court found the allegations as to citizenship of the parties were true; found 'the amount in controversy herein, by reason of defendant's motion to dismiss, must be construed to be in excess of $3,000. 00, exclusive of interest and costs'; found the facts as to the business and conduct of the parties substantially as alleged in the complaint; but found that the petitioner had not interfered with the normal operation of respondent's business or diverted any of respondent's profit.\n As conclusions of law the court held that it had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter 'since defendant's motion to dismiss admits for the purpose of pleading all facts well pleaded in the bill of complaint and particularly the necessary diverse citizenship between complainant and defendant and the allegation that there is involved in the controversy herein more than $3,000.00, exclusive of interest and costs' and that 'the complainant is a proper party to prosecute this action on its own behalf and on behalf of its members.' Based upon certain of the findings of fact the court concluded the acts of the petitioner did not amount to unfair competition with respondent or any of its members and did not violate their property rights; held, therefore, that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; vacated the temporary restraining order, refused a preliminary injunction, and granted the petitioner's motion to dismiss with prejudice. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed2 and ordered that a preliminary injunction issue restraining the petitioner from appropriating and broadcasting any of the news gathered by the respondent for the period following publication in respondent's newspapers during which \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 276]\n\u00a0\n the broadcasting of the pirated news to petitioner's most remote auditors may damage the business of respondent's papers in procuring and maintaining their subscriptions and advertising. On the merits the court thought the case controlled by International News Service v. Associated Press, \n248 \nU.S. 215\n, 39 S.Ct. 68, 2 A.L.R. 293. Dealing with the petitioner's insistence that the amount in controversy was not shown to exceed $3,000.00 the court held that the International News Service Case required the conclusion that the respondent was in competition with the petitioner because the decision in that case indicated that the profit seeking business of the constituent newspapers is an integral part of the corporate purpose of the respondent; and that 'The several millions of dollars here alleged to be invested in the Association's business (the bill contains no such allegation) may well be damaged to the extent of $3, 000 by the pirating practices described.' After referring to the character and scope of the respondent's activities the court states: 'It is obvious that the business of gathering and distributing to members, before profitable publication, could conceivably be damaged to the extent of $3, 000 by the misappropriation and premature publication of the news material. To hold otherwise would warrant the inference that no corporation could be damaged by a wrongful attack on its business, when that business happened to be run at no profit or at a loss. Also, we are unable to hold irrational the claim that the piracy caused a $3,000 damage to the Association's quasi property right in the news.'\n Although the decision with respect to the amount in controversy was assigned as error in this court, the parties have in the main directed their arguments to the merits; the respondent insisting that International News Service v. Associated Press fully sustains the decree below; the petitioner contending that cause may be distinguished from the one there adjudicated, or, if not, that \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 277]\n\u00a0\n decision should be modified. We have no occasion to consider the soundness of these conflicting contentions, for we hold that in the circumstances the respondent had the burden of showing that the case was within the District Court's jurisdiction, and failed to carry it.\n The bill seeks redress for damage to the respondent's business and for damage to the business of some or all of its members. The right for which the suit seeks protection is, therefore, the right to conduct those enterprises free of the alleged unlawful interference by the petitioner. No facts are pleaded which tend to show the value of that right. The complaint contains nothing to the purpose save the general statement that the damage to which the respondent is being subjected is in excess of three thousand dollars and the amount involved is in excess of that sum. Such a formal allegation is sufficient, unless the bill contains others which qualify or detract from it in such measure that when all are considered together it cannot fairly be said that jurisdiction appears on the face of the complaint, in which case the suit should be dismissed by the court sua sponte3 or upon the defendant's motion. \n4\n In this case the formal allegation is not reenforced or strengthened by other portions of the complaint; neither is it neutralized or weakened by qualifying or detracting allegations. In effect it stands alone. Therefore the court would not have been bound to dismiss upon a motion based solely on alleged insufficient pleading of the amount in controversy; though it might, of its own motion, have entered upon an inquiry to ascertain whether the cause was one over which it had jurisdiction. \n5\n But \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 278]\n\u00a0\n where the allegations as to the amount in controversy are challenged by the defendant in an appropriate manner, the plaintiff must support them by competent proof. \n6\n The petitioner's motion was an appropriate method of challenging the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint. It did not operate merely as a demurrer, for it did not assume the truth of the bill's averments and assert that in spite of their truth the complaint failed to state a case within the court's jurisdiction. On the contrary the motion traversed the truth of the allegations as to amount in controversy and in support of the denial recited facts dehors the complaint. This could have been done by answer but the time for answer had not arrived when the rule to show cause was issued and petitioner was faced with the possibility of an injunction. The motion required the trial court to inquire as to its jurisdiction before considering the merits of the prayer for preliminary injunction. And in such inquiry complainant had the burden of proof. \n7\n The only attempt to meet that burden is a reply affidavit filed on behalf of respondent, wherein it is deposed 'that the payments made by newspapers for said news sold to them by complainant in the territory served by said radio station is upwards of $8,000 per month, which is being imperilled and jeopardized by the acts of defendant ... by its unlawful and wrongful appropriation of complainant's news, and said sum greatly exceeds the sum of Three Thousand Dollars, exclusive of interest and costs, and complainant is in danger of losing said memberships and payments if defendant's practices in respect to pirating said news is not enjoined.' This deposition must be read in connection with the statement in the bill that the respondent makes no profit from furnishing news to its members but equitably divides the expense amongst them. The association \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 279]\n\u00a0\n cannot therefore lose the $8,000 in question. If the three newspapers in the affected territory cease to pay the sum, they will save it, not lose it, and, as to any other damage they may suffer from petitioner's competition, the affiant is silent. Assuming, without deciding, that in the circumstances disclosed the respondent has standing to maintain a suit to redress or prevent damage caused its members by petitioner's conduct, the allegation of possible damage to them is wholly inadequate, because the asserted danger of loss of members is a mere conclusion unsupported by even a suggestion that withdrawal has been threatened by any newspaper, and no intimation is given of the character or extent of the damage they would suffer by such withdrawal. The respondent having failed to support the allegations as to amount in controversy the District Court should have dismissed the bill.\n The suggestion is made in the respondent's argument, and in the opinion below, that, as the allegations in the International News Service Case, supra, were substantially like those of the bill now before us, this court must have been of opinion that the District Court had jurisdiction in the International Case or it would not have considered the merits. But in that case the answer did not challenge the jurisdiction, there was no assignment of error raising the question and no argument on the subject was presented to this court. 'The most that can be said is that the point was in the cases if any one had seen fit to raise it. Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.' Webster v. Fall, \n266 \nU.S. 507, 511\n, 45 S.Ct. 148, 149.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the District Court's jurisdiction on the ground that the finding upon that point was not without support, and the appellate tribunal could not say it was wrong, in view of the magni- \n\n[299 U.S. 269, 280]\n\u00a0\n tude of the respondent's operations and expenditures. As pointed out in McNutt v. General Motors, etc., Corporation, supra, \n298 U.S. 178\n, at pages 180 and 181, 56 S.Ct. 780, 781, these factors are irrelevant upon the issue of the value of the right for which protection is here sought.\n Since the allegation as to amount in controversy was challenged in appropriate manner, and no sufficient evidence was offered in support thereof, the bill should have been dismissed. McNutt v. General Motors, etc., Corp., supra, \n298 U.S. 178\n, at page 190, 56 S.Ct. 780, 785. The Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction of the appeal and as the District Court lacked jurisdiction its decree dismissing the bill should have been affirmed on that ground.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court, with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint for want of jurisdiction.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 9 F.Supp.(D.C.) 279. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 80 F.(2d) 575, 579. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Mansfield, C. & L.M.

NORTH AMERICAN CO.(1936)\nNo. 221\nArgued: November 9, 1936Decided: December 7, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 249]\n\u00a0\n Cummings, Atty. Gen., Stanley F. Reed, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., and Robert H. Jackson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioners.\n Mr. John C. Higgins, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy hinges upon the power of a court to stay proceedings in one suit until the decision of another, and upon the propriety of using such a power in a given situation.\n Respondents, nonregistered holding companies, brought suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia to enjoin enforcement of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (chapter 687, 49 Stat. 803 (15 U.S.C.A.  79 et seq.)) on the ground that the Act in its entirety is unconstitutional and void. The complaint in No. 221 (the suit by the North American Company) was filed November 26, 1935; the complaint in No. 222 ( the suit by the American Water Works & Electric Company) was filed the next day. By concession the two plaintiffs are holding companies within the meaning of the Act, and must register thereunder if the Act is valid as to them. One plaintiff, the North American Company, is at the apex of a pyramid which includes subsidiary holding companies as well as \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 250]\n\u00a0\n subsidiary operating companies, these last being engaged as public utilities in supplying gas and electricity to consumers in different states. The other plaintiff, American Water Works & Electric Company, is at the apex of another pyramid including like subsidiaries. The defendants in both suits (petitioners in this court) are the members of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Attorney General of the United States, and the Postmaster General.\n On November 26, 1935, the Commission filed a bill of complaint in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York to compel other holding companies, members of a different public utility system, to register with the Commission in accordance with the statute. At the beginning, the defendants were the Electric Bond & Share Company, the parent holding company, and five intermediate holding company subsidiaries. Sixteen other holding company subsidiaries were later added as defendants with the Government's consent. All the twenty-two defendants, parties to that suit, appeared and answered the complaint. All joined in a cross-bill contesting the validity of the Act and praying a decree restraining its enforcement. To give opportunity for full relief, the present petitioners appeared as cross-defendants, answering the cross-bill and opposing an injunction.\n On December 7, 1935, the Attorney General filed a notice of motion in behalf of the petitioners for a stay of proceedings in Nos. 221 and 222, pending at that time in the District of Columbia. The petitioners had not yet submitted their answer to the bills, but their position as supporters of the statute in its application to respondents was made abundantly apparent. By the notice of motion it was shown that other suits to restrain the enforcement of the Act had been filed by other plaintiffs in the District of Columbia, and many more in other districts. The Government professed its anxiety to secure an early \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 251]\n\u00a0\n determination of its rights, and to that end pledged itself to proceed with all due diligence to prosecute the suit which it had chosen as a test. There were representations that the trial of a multitude of suits would have a tendency 'to clog the courts, overtax the facilities of the Government, and make against that orderly and economical disposition of the controversy that is the Government's aim.' Accordingly the court was asked to stay proceedings in the suits at bar 'until the validity of said Act has been determined by the Supreme Court of the United States' in the Electric Bond & Share case, 'or until that case is otherwise terminated.' To that motion the plaintiffs filed an answer on December 12, 1935, contesting the power of the court to grant the requested stay, asserting that the questions to be passed upon in their suits were not identical with the questions presented in the test one, pointing out that the Act even if valid as applied to some companies, might be invalid as applied to others, and dwelling upon the loss that they were suffering day by day while the menace of the Act obstructed their business and cast a cloud on its legality.\n Upon the argument of the motion the Attorney General and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that until the validity of the Act had been determined by this court in a civil suit which would be diligently prosecuted, neither the Attorney General nor the Commission would seek to enforce the criminal penalties of the Act, and that even after such determination they would not seek to exact penalties for earlier offenses. Written notice to that effect was given to all prosecuting officers. At the same time the Postmaster General announced that even if he had authority, he would not exclude any company from using the mails because of any violation of the Act pending the judicial determination of its validity by this court. Also, the Commission issued a regulation permitting a holding company, when register- \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 252]\n\u00a0\n ing, to reserve any legal or constitutional right and to stipulate that its registration should be void and of no effect in the event that such a reservation should be adjudged invalid or ineffective. Finally, the Attorney General offered to submit to a temporary injunction restraining the enforcement of the Act until the Electric Bond & Share case should be determined by this court. On the other side, the plaintiffs offered to consolidate their cases and thus dispose of them as one. They also offered, as we were informed upon the argument, to select a group of suits, not more than three or four, to be tried at the same time, with the understanding that any others would then be held in abeyance. These offers were rejected, and the Government stood upon its motion.\n How many suits for like relief were pending in the same and other districts was the subject of oral representations when the motion was submitted. By consent, however, an affidavit by the Attorney General was afterwards supplied with a stipulation of counsel supplementary thereto. The affidavit and stipulation were accepted by the Court, and give precision to representations that would otherwise be vague. From the affidavit it appeared that, in addition to the suits at bar, forty-seven suits had been brought in thirteen districts, five of them, afterwards reduced to four, in the District of Columbia, the others elsewhere. From the stipulation it appeared, however, that none of the cases in other districts would be heard or determined on the merits. The bills were to be dismissed or process was to be quashed in so far as relief was demanded against any officials who are parties to the present suits, and this for the reason that as to all such defendants the venue was improper. In a few suits there were to be decrees pro confesso against local officials who had been instructed by the Attorney General not to offer a defense. The number of pending suits was thus reduced to those in the District of Columbia, though there \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 253]\n\u00a0\n was a possibility, more or less uncertain, that there would be a renewal in that district of the suits begun elsewhere and discontinued or dismissed. Along with the affidavit and stipulation the Government submitted a copy of the complaint and the cross-bill in the suit against the Bond & Share Company.\n Upon this showing the District Judge reached the conclusion that the motion should be granted, stating his reasons in an opinion. 'A decision,' he said, 'by the Supreme Court in the Electric Bond and Share case, even if it should not dispose of all the questions involved, would certainly narrow the issues in the pending cases and assist in the determination of the questions of law involved.' However, the granting of the motion would be conditioned upon diligent and active prosecution of the Government's suit. An order was made on January 9, 1936, staying all proceedings upon the terms and conditions stated in the opinion. From that order the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia allowed a special appeal, which was heard in April, 1936 (four judges sitting), and decided in June. There were three opinions: An opinion by Mr. Justice Van Orsdel, concurred in by the Chief Justice; a separate opinion by Mr. Justice Groner; and a dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Stephens. 85 F. (2d) 398, 400. The first opinion states the question before the court to be whether or not the District Court had 'abused its discretionary power in the control of its docket.' Standing alone, this statement would seem to concede that there was power, the inquiry being merely whether the power had been discreetly exercised. The concession, if made, was speedily withdrawn. A few sentences later we are told that the power is confined to cases where the issues and the parties are the same. The separate opinion of Groner, J., treats the subject with greater flexibility. He suggests that after joinder of issue there may be a postponement of the trial if the court \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 254]\n\u00a0\n in the control of its own docket shall find that course expedient. He couples this with a statement that a stay so indefinite as the one before him would be too broad in any case. None the less, much latitude of judgment would have been left to the trial judge if the standards of that opinion had been adopted as a guide. But plainly they were not. The order of the Court of Appeals in each of the two suits reverses the stay order and remands the cause 'for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this court.' Evidently the trial judge was expected to conform to doctrine expounded for his instruction in the course of an opinion, yet he would have difficulty in knowing which opinion to select. He might believe that comity or deference constrained him to submit to the opinion approved by two members of the reviewing court, since none had been accepted by the vote of a majority. At the very least there was a likelihood, and indeed almost a certainty, of confusion and embarrassment. In such circumstances the call is plain for a decision that will mark with greater clearness the bounds of power and discretion. We granted certiorari that this result might be attained.\n Viewing the problem as one of power, and of power only, we find ourselves unable to assent to the suggestion that before proceedings in one suit may be stayed to abide the proceedings in another, the parties to the two causes must be shown to be the same and the issues identical. Indeed, counsel for the respondents, if we understand his argument aright, is at one with us in that regard, whatever may have been his attitude at the hearing in the courts below. Apart, however, from any concession, the power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants. How this can best be done calls for the exercise of judgment, which must \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 255]\n\u00a0\n weigh competing interests and maintain an even balance. Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 760, 763\n, 51 S.Ct. 304, 305, 306; Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 55 S.Ct. 310, 311. True, the suppliant for a stay must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to some one else. Only in rare circumstances will a litigant in one cause be compelled to stand aside while a litigant in another settles the rule of law that will define the rights of both. Considerations such as these, however, are counsels of moderation rather than limitations upon power. There are indeed opinions, though none of them in this court, that give color to a stricter rule. Impressed with the likelihood or danger of abuse, some courts have stated broadly that, irrespective of particular conditions, there is no power by a stay to compel an unwilling litigant to wait upon the outcome of a controversy to which he is a stranger. Dolbeer v. Stout, 139 N.Y. 486, 489, 34 N.E. 1102; Rosenberg v. Slotchin, 181 App.Div. 137, 138, 168 N.Y.S. 101; cf. Wadleigh v. Veazie, Fed.Cas.No.17,031; Checker Cab Mfg. Co. v. Checker Taxi Co. (D. C.) 26 F.(2d) 752; Jefferson Standard Life Ins. Co. v. Keeton (C.C.A.) 292 F. 53. Such a formula, as we view it, is too mechanical and narrow. Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. United States, supra; Friedman v. Harrington (C.C.) 56 F. 860; Amos v. Chadwick, L.R. 9 Ch.Div. 459; L.R. 4 Ch.Div. 869, 872. All the cases advancing it could have been adequately disposed of on the ground that discretion was abused by a stay of indefinite duration in the absence of a pressing need. If they stand for more than this, we are unwilling to accept them. Occasions may arise when it would be 'a scandal to the administration of justice' in the phrase of Jessel, M.R. (Amos v. Chadwick, L.R. 9 Ch.Div. 459, 462), if power to coordinate the business of the court efficiently and sensibly were lacking altogether. \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 256]\n\u00a0\n We must be on our guard against depriving the processes of justice of their suppleness of adaptation to varying conditions. Especially in cases of extraordinary public moment, the individual may be required to submit to delay not immoderate in extent and not oppressive in its consequences if the public welfare or convenience will thereby be promoted. In these Holding Company Act cases great issues are involved, great in their complexity, great in their significance. On the facts there will be need for the minute investigation of intercorporate relations, linked in a web of baffling intricacy. On the law there will be novel problems of far- reaching importance to the parties and the public. An application for a stay in suits so weighty and unusual will not always fit within the mould appropriate to an application for such relief in a suit upon a bill of goods. True, a decision in the cause then pending in New York may not settle every question of fact and law in suits by other companies, but in all likelihood it will settle many and simplify them all. Even so, the burden of making out the justice and wisdom of a departure from the beaten track lay heavily on the petitioners, suppliants for relief, and discretion was abused if the stay was not kept within the bounds of moderation.\n We are satisfied that the limits of a fair discretion are exceeded in so far as the stay is to continue in effect after the decision by the District Court in the suit against the Bond & Share Company, and until the determination by this court of any appeal therefrom. Already the proceedings in the District Court have continued more than a year. With the possibility of an intermediate appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, a second year or even more may go by before this court will be able to pass upon the Act. Whether the stay would have been proper if more narrowly confined will be considered later on. For the moment we fix the uttermost limit as the date of the first \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 257]\n\u00a0\n decision in the suit selected as a test, laying to one side the question whether it should even go so far. How the District Court in New York will decide the issues in that case is not to be predicted now. The Act may be held valid altogether, or valid in parts and invalid in others, or void in its entirety. Whatever the decision, the respondents are to be stayed by the terms of the challenged order until this court has had its say. They are not even at liberty, in case of an adjudication of partial invalidity, to bring themselves within the class adjudged to be exempt, though their membership in such a class may be uncertain or contested. Relief so drastic and unusual overpasses the limits of any reasonable need, at least upon the showing made when the motion was submitted.\n We think the answer is inadequate that in the contingencies suggested the respondents will be at liberty to move to vacate the stay, and will prevail upon that motion if they can satisfy the court that its restraints are then oppressive. To drive them to that course is to make them shoulder a burden that should be carried by the Government. The stay is immoderate and hence unlawful unless so framed in its inception that its force will be spent within reasonable limits, so far at least as they are susceptible of prevision and description. When once those limits have been reached, the fetters should fall off. To put the thought in other words, an order which is to continue by its terms for an immoderate stretch of time is not to be upheld as moderate because conceivably the court that made it may be persuaded at a later time to undo what it has done. Disapproval of the very terms that have already been approved as reasonable is at best a doubtful outcome of an application for revision. If a sceond stay is necessary during the course of an appeal, the petitioners must bear the burden, when that stage shall have arrived, of making obvious the need. Enough for present purposes that they have not done so yet. \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 258]\n\u00a0\n From the stay in its operation during the course of an appeal, we pass to the stay in its operation while the test suit is undetermined. That aspect of the order is subject to separate considerations and calls for separate treatment. The Government contends that a stay thus limited in duration is not unreasonably long, and that the respondents have been sufficiently protected against substantial loss or prejudice. The respondents deny that this is so, and insist that loss or prejudice, substantial in degree, is possible and even probable. We do not find it necessary to determine whether a stay to continue until the decision by the District Judge, and then ending automatically, would be moderate or excessive if viewed as of the time when the order differently conditioned was placed upon the files. Almost a year has gone by since the entry of that order, and in the intervening months many things have happened. All the parties have united in bringing these happenings to our notice and in inviting us to consider them. In the suit against the Bond & Share Company the facts have now been settled by stipulation; the briefs have been prepared; the case has been argued on the merits; and a decision may be expected within a reasonable time. With these happenings disclosed a decision by this court, if directed to the fairness of the stay order as of the date of its entry and if based upon a record made up substantially a year ago, would have little relation to present day realities. 'This court is a court of review and limits the exercise of its jurisdiction in accordance with its function.' AEro Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, \n295 \nU.S. 285, 294\n, 55 S.Ct. 709, 713. To bring about a fitting correspondence between rulings and realities, there must be a new appraisal of the facts by the court whose function it is to exercise discretion, and an appraisal in the light of the situation existing and developed at the time of the rehearing. Patterson v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 600, 607\n, 55 S.Ct. 575, 578; Watts, Watts \n\n[299 U.S. 248, 259]\n\u00a0\n & Co. v. Unione Austriaca, \n248 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 39 S.Ct. 1, 3 A.L. R. 323. Benefit and hardship will be set off, the one against the other, and upon an ascertainment of the balance discretionary judgment will be exercised anew.\n In each suit, the decree of the Court of Appeals is reversed, the order of the District Court vacated, and the cause remanded to the District Court to determine the motion for a stay in accordance with the principles laid down in this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEAHY v.

King, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for respondents. \n\n[297 U.S. 420, 421]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Leahy brought this action in a court of Oklahoma against the State Treasurer and others to recover $11.99 paid under protest as state income tax. He is a duly enrolled member of the Osage Tribe of Indians, and has long held a certificate of competency. As such member he is entitled to receive, from time to time, his pro rata share of the income of the restricted mineral resources of the tribe held by the United States for the tribe under the Act of June 28, 1906, c. 3572, 34 Stat. 539, and later legislation. The tax challenged is upon such income paid to him. Leahy claims that it is void because laid by the state upon a federal instrumentality. The trial court overruled the contention and entered judgment for the defendants. On the authority of Choteau v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 691\n, 51 S.Ct. 598, its action was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, three judges dissenting. 49 P.(2d) 570. We granted certiorari because of the constitutional question presented. \n296 \nU.S. 572\n, 56 S.Ct. 381.\n The facts are substantially the same as those presented in Choteau v. Burnet, supra, which upheld a federal income tax on a like payment. The applicable statutes and decisions are discussed there. As Leahy was entitled to have the income paid to him and was free to use it as he saw fit, no reason appears why it should not be taxable also by the state.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEGG v. ST. JOHN(1936)\nNo. 54\nArgued: November 18, 1935Decided: January 6, 1936\n\n\n\n As Amended Feb. 3, 1936. \n\n[296 U.S. 489, 490]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., and Henry Roberts, of Bristol, Va. (Mr. J. K. Brown, of Bristol, Tenn., on the brief), for petitioner.\n Mr. robert Burrow, of Bristol, Tenn., for respondent.\n Mr. Clayton Scyphers, of Bristol, Va., for respondent, pro hac vice, by Special leave of Court.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the bankrupt of his trustee is the person entitled to future monthly disability benefits payable under a contract entered into before the adjudication.\n On March 8, 1934, Legg, a resident of Tennessee, was, on his petition, adjudged a bankrupt. He then held a policy in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company by which it agreed, in consideration of an annual premium of $425.83, to pay upon his death either $24,000 in 240 monthly installments, or the single sum of $17,452, as commuted value. By a supplementary contract issued the same day and attached to the policy, the company, for an annual premium of $49.39, agreed, among other things, to pay a monthly benefit of $174.52, upon due proof that the insured had become totally and permanently disabled before the age of 60. By this provision, if Legg was 'pre- \n\n[296 U.S. 489, 491]\n\u00a0\n vented thereby from engaging in any occupation and performing any work for compensation or profit,' the company undertook to:\n'1. Waive the payment of each premium falling due under said Policy and this Supplementary Contract, and,\n\n'2. Pay to the insured, or a person designated by him for the purpose, or if such disability is due to, or is accompanied by, mental incapacity, to the beneficiary of record under said Policy, a monthly income of $10 for each $1,000 of insurance, or of commuted value of instalments, if any, under said Policy.'\n\n Legg had become totally and permanently disabled several years before the adjudication. The company had treated its obligation as matured; had waived the payment of premiums on both the policy and the supplementary contract; and, until the adjudication, had paid to him monthly the disability benefits. The bankrupt asked to have the life insurance policy and also the future disability benefits payable under the supplementary contract exempted from the operation of the assignment to the trustee. The latter set aside as exempt the life insurance policy and its cash sur ender value, but reported that the obligation of the company to make the benefit payments was an asset of the estate. The bankrupt excepted to the report in so far as it denied these to him. The referee ruled that the right to receive them vested in the bankrupt at the time of the adjudication; and that this right given by the supplementary contract is not insurance within the meaning of the laws granting exemptions. He accordingly overruled the exception of the bankrupt, but he directed that of the $174.52 payable monthly, the bankrupt should receive $40 as income exempt under the Tennessee law; and the trustee the balance, namely, $134. 52. The trustee acquiesced in the decision; the bankrupt sought review. The District Court confirmed the referee's order; and its judgment was affirmed \n\n[296 U.S. 489, 492]\n\u00a0\n by the Circuit Court of Appeals. In re Legg, 76 F.(2d) 841. This Court granted certiorari; conflict in decisions being alleged. Legg v. St. John, \n295 \nU.S. 728\n, 55 S.Ct. 916\n\n\n The bankrupt contends that the 'Supplementary Contract' covering disability is not a separate and distinct contract, but an integral part of the life insurance policy; that the obligation to pay disability benefits is insurance within the meaning of section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  110(a); that it did not pass to the trustee, since that feature has no cash surrender value; and that if it be held that the contract for disability benefits has a cash surrender value, its amount should be ascertained and the bankrupt be given the opportunity, by paying such value to the trustee, to hold the obligation free from the claims of creditors. The bankrupt contends further that any future disability payments are in the nature of future earnings or after-acquired property, and, hence do not pass to the trustee. Finally, he insists that the obligation of the company to pay disability benefits is property exempt under the law of Tennessee. All of these contentions are, in our opinion, unsound.\n The applicable statutes are these:\n The Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, 548, provides, in section 6 (11 U.S.C.A.  24), that it shall not affect the allowance of exemptions to the bankrupt prescribed by the laws of the state of his domicile; and in section 70a (11 U.S.C.A.  110(a) that: 'When any bankrupt shall have any insurance policy which has a cash surrender value payable to himself, his estate, or personal representatives, he may, within thirty days after the cash surrender value has been ascertained and stated to the trustee by the company issuing the same, pay or secure to the trustee the sum so ascertained and stated, and continue to hold, own, and carry such policy free from the claims of the creditors participating in the distribution of his estate under the bankruptcy proceedings, otherwise the policy shall pass to the trustee as assets.' \n\n[296 U.S. 489, 493]\n\u00a0\n The Tennessee Code (1932) provides:\n'8456. Insurance on husband's life, effected by himself, goes to wife and children.-Any life insurance effected by a husband on his own life shall, in case of his death, inure to the benefit of his widow and children; and the money thence arising shall be divided between them according to the statutes of distribution, without being in any manner subject to the debts of the husband.\n\n'8458. Life insurance or annuity for or assigned the wife or children, or dependent relatives is exempt from claims of creditors.-The net amount payable under any policy of life insurance or under any annuity contract upon the life of any person made for the benefit of, or assigned to, the wife and\/or children, or dependent relatives of such person, shall be exempt from all claims of the creditors of such person arising out of or based upon any obligation created after the effective date of this Code, whether or not the right to change the named beneficiary is reserved by or permitted to such person.'\n\n First. As Legg had become totally and permanently disabled before the adjudication, the co pany's obligation to make benefit payments monthly thereafter was property of the bankrupt which passed to the trustee, unless specially exempted by the law of Tennessee, or by section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  110(a). It was not exempted by section 70a, because the obligation to pay disability benefits is not 'insurance' within the meaning of that section. The term 'insurance' as there used referred only to legal reserve life insurance, the kind of insurance to which a cash surrender value was a common incident. For such value specific detailed provision is commonly made in life policies. Compare Burlingham v. Crouse, \n228 \nU.S. 459\n, 33 S.Ct. 564, 46 L.R.A.( N.S.) 148; Cohen v. Samuels, \n245 \nU.S. 50\n, 38 S.Ct. 36.1 The effect of the pro- \n\n[296 U.S. 489, 494]\n\u00a0\n vision in section 70a is to assign to the trustee the cash surrender value of the life insurance policy. Everett v. Judson, \n228 \nU.S. 474\n, 33 S.Ct. 568, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 154. No provision is made in the 'Supplementary Contract' for a cash surrender value of the obligations thereby assumed; and none is provided by law or custom. Provision for the payment of disability benefits in connection with such life insurance was not introduced in the United States until about twenty years after the passage of the Bankruptcy Act. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The fact that the disability benefits are provided for in a 'Supplementary Contract' issued on the same day as the policy and physically attached thereto does not make them life insurance. The life policy and the contract were executed as distinct instruments. The 'Supplementary Contract' was to operate for some purposes as if a part of the life policy. \n3\n But for all other pur- \n\n[296 U.S. 489, 495]\n\u00a0\n poses it is a separate obligation. The hazards covered by the two instruments are obviously different. The beneficiaries differ also. The payment under the life policy was to be made to the wife;4 the disability benefits are to be paid to Legg himself. A separate and different premium was exacted for the obligations assumed in each instrument. It was provided that forfeiture of the life policy would terminate all right arising from disability; but the supplementary contract could be terminated by Legg without affecting otherwise his life policy.\n Third. The obligation of the company to pay disability benefits in the future is not after-acquired property. It is property which was acquired by Legg long before the adjudication, and fully paid for by the premiums paid before the adjudication. Nor are the benefits payable after the adjudication in any sense future earnings. They are not the fruit of anything to be done by Legg after the adjudication. The right to receive disability benefits in the future does not differ from any other right acquired before adjudication to receive money thereafter. It is in essence an annuity purchased and paid for prior to the adjudication. Like other property, it passed to the trustee, unless exempted by the law of the bankrupt's \n\n[296 U.S. 489, 496]\n\u00a0\n domicile. \n5\n The principle declared in Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 \nU.S. 234\n, 54 S.Ct. 695, 93 A.L.R. 195, is not applicable here.\n Fourth. No statute of Tennessee exempts disability benefits. Its law is, in some respects, more liberal to the debtor than section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  110(a). Section 8456 provides that 'any life insurance effected by a husband on his own life shall, in case of his death, inure to the benefit of his widow and children,' free from claims of the husband's creditors. This has been held to mean that the cash surrender value, as well as the policy, is exempt. \n6\n But there obviously was no intention to exempt this contract right which is not life insurance, or 'the money thence arising,' since section 8456 is, in substance, a re- enactment of the statute passed in 1846. Section 8458, enacted in 1925, and slightly modified since, is not applicable here. It deals only with life insurance and annuity contracts 'made for the benefit of, or assigned to, the wife and\/or children, or dependent relatives.' Even if a contract for future disability benefits be deemed an annuity within the meaning of that section, it does not apply, because this contract to pay disability benefits was not made for, and has not been assigned to, Legg's wife, his children, or any dependent. The highest court of Tennessee has not had occasion to decide whether future disability benefits are exempt from claims of creditors; but the intermediate appellate court has held that the statute exempting life insurance does not apply to disability benefits payable \n\n[296 U.S. 489, 497]\n\u00a0\n under a so-called health-insurance policy. Cravens v. Robbins, 8 Tenn.App. 435, 437.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Legg policy contained a table of cash surrender values. This related to the separate obligation to pay the face of the policy on death. It had no relation to the company's obligation under the 'Supplementary Contract' for disability benefits. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare In re Kern (D.C.) 8 F.Supp. 246. As early as 1910, some companies had inserted in their policies a provision that if the insured became 'totally and permanently' disabled, payment of premiums would be waived so long as such disability continued. See New York Life Insurance Co. v. Edwards, \n271 \nU.S. 109, 117\n, 118 S., 46 S.Ct. 436. A little later, some companies introduced the provision that in case of total and permanent disability the face of the policy would be paid in annual installments beginning after the accrual of disability; the amounts so paid to correspondingly reduce the final amount of the policy payable at death, so that the entire liability under the policy could be extinguished even without death. Policies issued under the War Rick Insurance Act, October 6, 1917, c. 105, 40 Stat. 398, provide, in addition to payments of (say) $10,000 on death, monthly benefit payments up to $57. 50; the aggregate to be deducted from the face of the policy. It was not until about 1920 that provision was made for the payment, in consideration of an additional premium, of monthly disability benefits in addition to the full face of the pelicy at death. See Hunter and Phillips, 'Disability Benefits in Life Insurance Policies,' Actuarial Study No. 5 (2d Ed.) part 1, c. I (1932); Arthur Hunter, Papers on Disability Benefits, Eighth International Congress of Actuaries (1927), p. 83. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] It concludes: 'The Supplementary Contract shall be deemed to be a part o the above numbered Policy and the provisions of said Policy concerning declarations and representations by the insured, restrictions, payment of premiums, change of beneficiary, and assignment, are hereby referred to and by such reference made a part hereof. No other provision of said Policy shall be held or deemed to be a part hereof, except (a) The provision of said Policy as to incontestability shall apply hereto, but shall not preclude the Company from requiring as a condition to recovery hereunder, due proof of such total and permanent disability as entitles him to the benefits hereof. (b) The provision of said Policy as to reinstatement shall apply hereto, except that this Supplementary Contract shall not be reinstated unless said Policy is in force and no premium is in default thereon, or unless said Policy is reinstated at the time of reinstatement of this Supplementary Contract.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Later, Legg changed the beneficiary to his children, reserving the right to change the beneficiary thereafter. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See In re Wright (C.C.A.) 157 F. 544, 18 L.R.A.(N.S.) 193; In re Burtis (D.C.) 188 F. 527; In re Matschke (D.C.) 193 F. 284; In re Evans (D.

OF MINNEAPOLIS(1936)\nNo. 743\nArgued: April 3, 1936Decided: April 27, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edward S. Stringer, of St. Paul, Minn., Marcus L. Bell, of Chicago, Ill., and Alexander E. Horn, of St. Paul, Minn., for Lowden and others, trustees, etc.\n Mr. Claude G. Krause, of Minneapolis, Minn., for Northwestern Nat. Bank & Trust Co. \n\n[298 U.S. 160, 161]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On June 7, 1933, the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois its petition for reorganization under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. See 11 U.S.C.  205 (see 11 U.S.C.A.  205).* At that time the railroad had to its credit the sum of $36,908.72 in a checking account with the Northwestern National Bank & Trust Company of Minneapolis. The bank was then the owner of First and Refunding Gold bonds issued by the railroad of the par value of $100,000, not yet in default in respect of principal or interest. On June 19, 1933, seven days after receiving a copy of an order approving the petition for reorganization, the bank set off the deposit against the bonds by appropriate entries upon its books of account. Trustees of the estate of the railroad were appointed by the court in accordance with the statute, though whether before the attempted set-off or thereafter the record does not tell us. They brought suit against the bank in the United States District Court for Minnesota, not the court of bankruptcy administration, to recover the amount of the deposit set off against the bonds. After answer by the bank and a trial of the issues, the court entered a decree upholding the validity of the set- off, with a correction not now material as to the amount of the deposit. 11 F.Supp. 929. The trustees appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. That court, after certifying the facts substantially as summarized above, requested our instructions upon the following questions (Judicial Code,  239, 28 U.S.C.  346, 28 U.S.C.A.  346): \n\n[298 U.S. 160, 162]\n\u00a0\n 'Question 1. Does the right of set-off recognized by section 68(a) of the Bankruptcy Act apply to reorganization proceedings under section 77 of that act?\n'Question 2. If the first question be answered in the affirmative, can a bank which owns the unmatured bonds of a railroad corporation set off a deposit account of the railroad with the bank against the bonds, upon the filing by the railroad of a petition for reorganization under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, alleging that the railroad is unable to meet its debts as they mature?\n\n'Question 3. If the first and second questions be answered in the affirmative, may the United States District Court, for the District of Minnesota, in the suit by the trustees of the railroad's estate to recover the amount deducted from the account of t e railroad by the bank under the claimed right of set-off, recognize and establish as a proper set-off by the bank one which was not made until after the filing of the petition for reorganization and which has never been ordered, authroized, approved, or consented to by the court in which that petition was filed and approved?'\n\n This court has had occasion recently to restate the rules announced in earlier decisions as to the mode of formulating questions coming here upon certificates. Triplett v. Lowell (Mantle Lamp Co. of America v. Aluminum Products Co.), \n297 \nU.S. 638\n, 56 S.Ct. 645 (March 30, 1936). We will not answer abstract questions unrelated to the pending controversy, or questions unnecessarily general, or questions which admit of one answer in one set of circumstances and a different answer in another; the differentiating circumstances being imperfectly disclosed. White v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 51 S.Ct. 115, 117; United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 66\n, 35 S.Ct. 16; United States v. Hall, \n131 \nU.S. 50, 52\n, 9 S.Ct. 663; Webster v. Cooper, 10 How. 54, 55; Hallowell v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 101, 107\n, 28 S.Ct. 498; General Motors Corporation v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 49, 63\n, 52 S.Ct. 468, 82 A.L.R. 600. The questions now be- \n\n[298 U.S. 160, 163]\n\u00a0\n fore us have been framed without adequate regard to these established rules of practice.\n Question No. 1 is too general and abstract, its relation to the controversy being indirect and problematical. 'In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the estate of a bankrupt and a creditor the account shall be stated and one debt shall be set off against the other, and the balance only shall be allowed or paid.' Bankruptcy Act  68a, 11 U.S.C.  108(a), 11 U.S.C.A.  108(a). The precept, framed on the example of ancient laws across the seas (4 Anne, c. 17,  11; 5 Geo. II, c. 30,  28), is now applicable by force of statute to the liquidation of estates in bankruptcy. We are asked to announce broadly whether it is applicable with similar inclusiveness to proceedings to reorganize a railroad, though the question tells us nothing as to the facts behind the controversy. 'The court has repeatedly held that it will not answer questions of objectionable generality.' White v. Johnson, supra; United States v. Worley, \n281 \nU.S. 339, 340\n, 50 S.Ct. 291; United States v. Mayer, supra. Without a showing of the facts an answer to this question would declare a mere abstraction which might seem too narrow or too broad thereafter when the facts were shown forth. One must see the controversy in its setting before the implications of a ruling can be prefigured with assurance.\n Question No. 2 is dependent by its terms upon an affirmative answer to question No. 1. It is open, however, to objections on its own account. Like question No. 1, it is far too general in its range. Moreover, it is silent as to facts which a court of equity should know before hazarding an answer. A proceeding to reorganize is not a bankruptcy, though an amendment to the bankruptcy act creates and regulates the remedy. From the fact without more that such a proceeding has been initiated, one cannot know that it will be necessary to have recourse to section 68, 11 U.S.C.A .  108, \n\n[298 U.S. 160, 164]\n\u00a0\n which was meant in its enactment to prescribe the rule of set-off upon a distribution of the assets. That stage of administration, or the analogous stage of a revision of the debts, may never be attained in a proceeding to reorganize, though a petition has been approved and trustees have been appointed. If a plan of reorganization is not proposed or accepted, or, being proposed and accepted, is not confirmed by the court within a reasonable time, the whole proceeding may be dismissed (section 77(c)(7), 47 Stat. 1476); the title to the estate thus reverting to the debtor. By that time there may even be ability to pay demands as they mature. What is done at the beginnin amounts to little more than a provisional sequestration to give protection for the future.\n The right of set-off must fit itself to these procedural conditions. It is not susceptible of definition in the abstract without reference to the time or occasion of the controversy or the relation of the suit to the primary proceeding. Irrespective of the acceptance or confirmation of a plan, the trustees must have the power to gather in the assets and keep the business going. To exercise that power, they may find it necessary to sue, and the suit may turn upon the right of set-off, as it does in the case at hand. In a suit for such a purpose, a suit collateral to the main proceeding and initiated at a time when the outcome of that proceeding is still unknown and unknowable, section 68 of the statute does not control the disposition of the controversy ex proprio vigore. It governs, if at all, by indirection and analogy according to the circumstances. The rule to be accepted for the purpose of such a suit is that enforced by courts of equity, which differs from the rule in bankruptcy chiefly in its greater flexibility, the rule in bankruptcy being framed in adaptation to standardized conditions, and that in equity varying with the needs of the occasion, though remaining \n\n[298 U.S. 160, 165]\n\u00a0\n constant, like the statute, in the absence of deflecting forces. Scott v. Armstrong, \n146 \nU.S. 499, 507\n, 13 S.Ct. 148; North Chicago Rolling Mill Co. v. St. Louis Ore & Steel Co., \n152 \nU.S. 596, 615\n, 14 S.Ct. 710; Scammon v.

Beckwith, 6 Mich. 168, 175, 72 Am.Dec. 69; Story, Equity Jurisprudence (14th Ed.)  1871, 1872\n\n\n The defects of the certificate, its incomplete disclosure of the facts conditioning an answer, are thus exhibited in clear relief. 'Insolvency' in proceedings to reorganize (section 77) is often very different from 'insolvency' in ordinary bankruptcy (section 1(15), 11 U.S. C.A.  1(15). There is at least a possibility that at times the difference may be great enough to vary the resulting equities. When things are called by the same name, it is easy for the mind to slide into an assumption that the verbal identity is accompanied in all its sequences by identity of meaning. A court of equity in allowing or rejecting set-off will not be guilty of that fallacy. To know 'the justice of the particular case' ( Scott v. Armstrong, supra; Story, Equity Jurisprudence, supra), one must know the case in its particulars. More concretely, one must know the value of the assets, the temporary or permanent character of the debtor's inability to pay its debts as they mature, the liens, if there are any, superior to the bonds in controversy, the probability of an understanding that the bonds, though unmatured, would be used to cancel the deposits, all the circumstances, in brief, that might affect the judgment of the chancellor in weighing the competing equities of the \n\n[298 U.S. 160, 166]\n\u00a0\n interested factions and shaping his decree accordingly. We have no thought at this time to foreshadow the result of an exploring expedition directed to those ends. When all the facts are known, they may be found to offer no excuse for a departure from the rule in bankruptcy which, as indicated already, is generally, even if not always, the rule in equity as well. They may point, on the other hand, to the need for an exception, or may even lead to a decree in the nature of a compromise, the moneys being paid into the registry of the court to abide its f ture action. A decision balancing the equities must await the exposure of a concrete situation with all its qualifying incidents. What we disclaim at the moment is a willingness to put the law into a strait-jacket by subjecting it to a pronouncement of needless generality.\n Question No. 3 is so framed as not to call for an answer unless an affirmative answer is given to questions Nos. 1 and 2.\n Our conclusion as to the defective form of the certificate is borne out in a striking way by the concession of the parties. Before the argument on the questions, plaintiffs and defendant joined in moving us for an order to bring up the whole case. That motion was denied. Nothing in the nature of the controversy called for a writ of certiorari in advance of a decision by the court of intermediate appeal. The significant thing, however, is that in briefs submitted on that motion both parties admitted that the second question was defective. The plaintiffs said: The statement 'is not sufficiently complete to enable this court to answer the second question as applied to this case.' The defendant made a like objection. Plaintiffs and defendant fortified their general criticism by the enumeration of particular defects.\n The certificate is dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The references in this opinion are to section 77 as enacted March 3, 1933, 47 Stat. 1474, and not to the amendments of August 27, 1935, 49 Stat. 911, 926.\n\n\n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMANHATTAN GENERAL EQUIPMENT CO. v.

The facts, so far as they concern the question here, are taken from the statement of that court:\n'The petitioners are affiliates of United Brokerage Company. That corporation filed income tax returns for itself and its affiliates for 1925 and 1926, and the petitioners seek to review tax deficiencies attributed to them by the Commissioner, which the Board of Tax Appeals has affirmed. ...\n\n'On June 30, 1925, the United Brokerage Company purchased for $3,41 , 345.63 in cash all the capital stock of Artemas Ward, Inc. (a New York corporation), that was \n\n[297 U.S. 129, 131]\n\u00a0\n issued and outstanding consisting of 4,964 shares of no par value. ...\n\n'On December 31, 1925, pursuant to a plan of reorganization, Artemas Ward, Inc. (N.Y.) transferred to Artemas Ward, Inc. (a Delaware corporation), in exchange for 100 shares of stock of the latter company of no par value, all its assets, then of a net book value of $1,246,920.07, with the exception of cash and accounts receivable aggregating $284,967.21- that is to say, the New York corporation transferred to the Delaware corporation assets of the value of $961,952.86. Immediately after the transfer, and on December 31, 1925, Artemas Ward, Inc. (N.Y.) distributed to United Brokerage Company the 100 shares of stock of Artemas Ward, Inc. ( Del.) and accounts receivable amounting to $234,967.21. In December, 1926, United Brokerage sold the entire 4,964 shares of Artemas Ward, Inc. (N.Y.) for $49,640. That stock had cost the United Brokerage $3,414,345.63 and the total must be apportioned between the 100 shares of the Delaware corporation (which it still owns) and the 4,964 shares of Artemas Ward, Inc. (N.Y.) in order to determine the loss suffered by the United Brokerage Company through its sale of the 4,964 shares at $49,640. ...\n\n'Upon the reorganization, the New York corporation had left among its assets, valued at $1,246,920.07, accounts receivable and cash aggregating $ 284,967.21, or approximately 22.85% thereof, after $961,952.86 had been transferred to the Delaware Company. Under Art. 1599(2) (as amended, infra) the portion of $3,414,345.63 paid by the United Brokerage Company for the stock of Artemas Ward, Inc. (N.Y.) represented by that stock after the reorganization was $780,303.97. If from this be deducted $234,967.21 accounts receivable and the $49,640 realized from the sale in December, 1926, there \n\n[297 U.S. 129, 132]\n\u00a0\n would be a loss of $495,696.76. This loss the Commissioner allowed in assessing the income tax for 1925. The second point raised on this appeal is whether the loss, for the year 1926, to which the United Brokerage Company and its affiliates were entitled was only the sum of $495,696.76 or was the sum of $2,167,785.56 which would arise through deducting from $ 3,414,345.63 (the cost of the stock of the New York company) the value at the time of the reorganization of the Delaware stock which was $961,952.86 and $234,967.21 realized from accounts receivable and $49,640 realized from sale of the 4,964 shares.'\n\n It thus appears, the New York company having parted with all its assets except $50,000 in cash, that the assets behind the 4,964 shares when the 100-share distribution was made consisted of only that sum, while the 100 shares of the Delaware company stock were represented by the transferred assets of the New York company of the value of $961,952.86. The sale of the 4,964 shares brought $49,640; and the simple question to be determined is, What method for the purposes of taxation should be employed to determine the loss in respect of the 4,964 shares under the Revenue Act of 1926,  204(a)(9), c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 14, 15 (26 U.S.C.A.  113 note)? That section provides that the basis for determining the gain or loss from such sale shall be the cost of the property, except that,\n'(9) If the property consists of stock or securities distributed after December 31, 1923, to a taxpayer in connection with a transaction described in subdivision (c) of section 203,1 the basis in the case of the stock in \n\n[297 U.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n respect of which the distribution was made shall be apportioned, under rules and regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary, between such stock and the stock or securities distributed.'\n\n At the time of the reorganization, article 1599 of Treasury Regulations 69, which had been promulgated on August 28, 1926, was in force. Petitioners invoke subdivision 2 of that regulation which provided:\n'Where the stock distributed in reorganization is in whole or in part of a character or preference materially different from the stock in respect of which the distribution is made, the cost or other basis of the old shares of stock shall be divided between such old stock and the new stock in proportion, as nearly as may be, to the respective values of each class of stock, old and new, at the time the new shares of stock are distributed, and the basis of each share of stock will be the quotient of the cost or other basis of the class with which such share belongs, divided by the number of shares in the class. The portion of the cost or other basis of the old shares of stock to be attributed to the shares of new stock shall in no case exceed the fair market value of such shares as of the time of their distribution.' (Italics added.)\n\n April 3, 1928, this regulation was amended by striking from it the italicized portion. The taxpayer contended that its loss should be computed in accordance with the original regulation. This would have resulted in an allocation to the 4,964 shares of the New York corporation of $2,452,392.77, and, after making certain deductions, the allowable loss, as already appears, would have been something over $2,000,000. The Commissioner, however, proceeding in strict accordance with the amended regulation, determined the amount of loss to be $495,696.76. Without pursuing the matter in further detail, it is enough to say that the case turns entirely upon the ques- \n\n[297 U.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n tion whether the loss was to be determined in accordance with the original or the amended regulation. If in accordance with the former, the taxpayer is right; if in accordance with the latter, the Commissioner is right. The court below held that the amended and not the original regulation furnished the applicable rule, and affirmed the determination of the Board of Tax Appeals, which in turn had sustained the Commissioner. We agree with that view.\n In determining a loss, the statute requires that the basis shall be 'apportioned' between the old and the new stock. To apportion is to 'divide and assign in just proportion,' 'to distribute among two or more a just part or share to each,' Fisher v. Charter Oak Life Ins. Co., 14 Abb.N. C.(N.Y.) 32, 36, albeit, a division may be just without necessarily being also an exactly equal division. The result of applying the original regulation here is to bring about an inequitable apportionment, contrary to the intent of the statute, and to credit the taxpayer with a loss essentially and greatly disproportionate. On the other hand, application of the amended regulation effectuates the legislative intent that the basis of apportionment between the old and the new stock shall result in a fair and jut division.\n The power of an administrative officer or board to administer a federal statute and to prescribe rules and regulations to that end is not the power to make law, for no such power can be delegated by Congress, but the power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of Congress as expressed by the statute. A regulation which does not do this, but operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity. Lynch v. Tilden Produce Co., \n265 U.S. 315\n, 320-322, 44 S.Ct. 488; Miller v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 435, 439\n, 440 S., 55 S.Ct. 440, and cases cited. And not only must a regulation, in order to be valid, be consistent with the statute, but it must be reasonable. \n\n[297 U.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n International R. Co. v. Davidson, \n257 \nU.S. 506, 514\n, 42 S.Ct. 179, 66 L.Ed . 41. The original regulation as applied to a situation like that under review is both inconsistent with the statute and unreasonable.\n The contention that the new regulation is retroactive is without merit. Since the original regulation could not be applied, the amended regulation in effect became the primary and controlling rule in respect of the situation presented. It pointed the way, for the first time, for correctly applying the antecedent statute to a situation which arose under the statute. See Titsworth v. Commissioner of Int. Rev. (C.C.A.) 73 F.(2d) 385, 386. The statute defines the rights of the taxpayer and fixes a standard by which such rights are to be measured. The regulation constitutes only a step in the administrative process. It does not, and could not, alter the statute. It is no more retroactive in its operation than is a judicial determination construing and applying a statute to a case in hand.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 203(c), 44 Stat. 13 (26 U.S.C.A.  112 note) provides: 'If there is distributed, in pursuance of a plan of reorganization, to a shareholder in a corporation a party to the reorganization, stock or securities in such corporation or n another corporation a party to the reorganization, without the surrender by such shareholder of stock or securities in such a corporation, no gain to the distributee from the receipt of such stock or securities shall be recognized.' \n\n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMATSON NAV.

Maurice E. Harrison and Herman Phleger, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellants.\n Mr. H. H. Linney, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The California Bank and Franchise Tax Act declares: Every business corporation, with exceptions not here material, 'shall annually pay to the state, for the privilege of exercising its corporate franchises within this state, a tax according to or measured by its net income' to be computed at the rate of 4 per cent. upon that income for the preceding year. Section 4 (St.1929, p. 20). If all the corporation's business is done in California, the tax shall be computed on its entire net income; if not, on that portion which is derived from business done within the state. Section 10 (St.1929, p. 24). Net income is the revenue from all sources less expenses, losses, bad debts, taxes, depreciation, depletion, etc. Sections 6, 7, and 8 (St.1929, pp. 20, 21).1\n Appellants were incorporated under the laws of California and, for purposes of taxation, are deemed affiliated. Section 14 (St.1929, p. 26). Matson Navigation Company and the Oceanic Steamship Company, in addition to doing substantial intrastate business in California, were engaged in transportation between ports on the Pacific Coast in the United States and ports in Hawaii, the South Sea Islands, Australia, and New Zealand. The Matson Terminals, Inc., had no 1930 net income from interstate or foreign com- \n\n[297 U.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n merce. In March, 1931, appellants made a consolidated return showing for 1930 net income from intrastate business of $730,357.81, and from interstate and foreign business of $2,526,148.22. They maintained that the tax should not be more than 4 per cent. of their net income from intrastate business. But the tax commissioner held that there should be included in the computation the part of their net income from interstate and foreign commerce that was attributable to California, found to be 22.2 per cent., and on that basis he assessed an additional tax. The state board of equalization sustained the additional assessment. The case was taken on writ of review to the state Supreme Court and there, contrary to appellants' contentions, it was held that the act as construed by the tax commissioner is not repugnant to the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3) or to the due process or equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 3 Cal.(2d) 1, 43 P.(2d) 805.\n The only question here is whether consistently with these constitutional provisions there may be included in the base, to which the rate of 4 per cent. was applied, any part of net income derived from appellants' interstate and foreign commerce.\n\n 1. \nDoes the tax burden interstate commerce? There is no controversy as to the amount, if any, that may be apportioned to California for the purpose of computing the tax. The state Supreme Court held that the act imposes a tax for the privilege of exercising corporate franchises and extends to every corporation, foreign or domestic, which is engaged in interstate or foreign commerce 'so long as such corporation is doing some intrastate business.' Apellants' franchises, including the right to be corporations empowered to do business in corpora e form in accordance with California law, were granted to them by the state, and undoubtedly the state may tax the privilege of exercising the franchises.

North Carolina, \n283 U.S. 123\n, 129 et seq., 51 S.Ct. 385. The act as construed below does not violate the commerce clause.\n\n 2. \nAppellants suggest that the additional tax has no relation to the privilege of exercising their corporate franchises, and that the state, by enforcing it, would deprive them of property without due process of law. They rely on Hans Rees' Sons v. North Carolina, supra. We \n\n[297 U.S. 441, 445]\n\u00a0\n there held that a method of allocating, for taxation, to a state that part of the income of a foreign corporation which bears the same ratio to its entire net income as the value of its tangible property within that state bears to the value of all its tangible property works an unconstitutional result if the part of the income thus attributed to the state is out of all appropriate proportion to the business there transacted by the corporation. There is nothing in that decision to support appellants' contention. In that case the question was as to apportionment of income to the taxing state. The controversy now before us concerns the amount to be paid for the privilege of using in California corporate franchises granted by that state to appellants. No question of apportionment is here involved. The tax commissioner's determination, 22.2 per cent., was not disturbed by the board of equalization or the Supreme Court, and appellants do not in this court challenge the use of that ratio. As above shown, net income from appellants' intrastate, interstate, and foreign business attributable to California may be taken into account in computing the tax. As the taxing jurisdiction of California extends to that income, the use thereof to compute the tax may not be said to be arbitrary, capricious, or in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n 3. \nAppellants insist that by enforcement of the tax in question the state would deny them the equal protection of the laws. They say: The tax is on the doing of business; it would be void if imposed on the doing of interstate and foreign business and can only be upheld as to intrastate business. Many corporations subject to the tax do only the latter. Others do both. The basis of the tax imposed on members of the class first mentioned is net income from intrastate business, while the basis of that exacted from members of the other class is net income from all business. The act imposes no tax \n\n[297 U.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n on corporations engaged exclusively in interstate and foreign business.\n The differences portrayed in the argument of appellants do not deny them equal protection of the laws. The measure of the tax is the total net income attributable to California; it does not depend upon the net derived from business wholly within or that partly within and partly without the state. Gains from intrastate business may be wiped out by losses sustained in interstate or foreign business and vice versa. The basis of the classification is not the kind of business-whether intrastate or otherwise- from which the income is derived; it is the exclusion of all income attributable to business done outside the state. The measure of the exaction does not lack uniformity because of differences in the amounts of net incomes attributable to California. Appellants' contention is not supported by the fact that there are or may be substantial differences between amounts and sources of net incomes of corporations subject to the tax. The rate is uniform; no discrimination results from its application.\n There is no merit in the suggestion that failure of the act to extend to foreign corporations exclusively engaged in interstate or foreign commerce in California constitutes an unconstitutional discrimination against appellants. A foreign corporation whose sole business in California is interstate and foreign commerce cannot be subjected to the tax in question. Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, \n268 U.S. 203\n, 216 et seq., 45 S.Ct. 477, 44 A.L.R. 1219; Anglo-Chilean, etc., Corp. v. Alabama, supra.

Bernard Ellenbogen, of Albany, N.Y., and Max Cohen, of Rochester, N.Y., on the brief), for appellant.\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 266, 268]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry S. Manley, of Albany, N.Y., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 266, 270]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant is a corporation formed under the laws of New York, pursuing the business of a milk dealer in Brooklyn. It did not enter the business until the autumn of 1933, when it applied for, and was granted, \n\n[297 U.S. 266, 271]\n\u00a0\n a license under the Milk Control Act of March 31, 1933. The statute having been re-enacted for the year commencing April 1, 1934, the company, on April 16, 1934, sought a license under the new act. After a hearing the application was denied. The Supreme Court granted a certiorari order, and upon that order and the return the Appellate Division confirmed the order of the Department of Agriculture and Markets refusing a license (Mayflower Farms, Inc., v. Baldwin, 242 App.Div. 881, 275 N.Y.S. 669) and this action was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (Id., 195 N.E. 532).\n The Milk Control Act of 1933,1 authorized a board to fix minimum prices for sales of fluid milk in bottles by dealers to stores in cities of more than one million inhabitants, with a differential of one cent per quart in favor of dealers 'not having a well advertised trade name.' \n2\n The term of the act was one year. An amended act, effective April 1, 1934,3 which placed milk control under the jurisdiction of a division of the Department of Agriculture and Markets, contained a similar provision with respect to the differential. The pertinent section, as it stood at the time of the appellant's application for a license, follows; the words in brackets having been in the original act, but eliminated when the statute was revised in 1934, those in italics having been added by the later act: 'It shall not be unlawful for any milk dealer who (at the time this act shall take effect, is) since April tenth, nineteen hundred thirty-three has been engaged continuously in the business of purchasing and handling milk not having a well advertised trade name in a city of more than one million inhabitants to sell fluid milk in bottles to stores in such city at a price not more than one cent per quart below the price of such milk sold to stores under \n\n[297 U.S. 266, 272]\n\u00a0\n a well advertised trade name, and such lower price shall also apply on sales from stores to consumers; provided that in no event shall the price of such milk not having a well advertised trade name, be more than one cent per quart below the minimum price fixed (by the board) for such sales to stores in such a city.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The appellant had not a well-advertised trade-name. The reason for refusing it a license was that though it had not been continuously in the business of dealing in milk since April 10, 1933, it had sold and was selling to stores milk at a price a cent below the established minimum price. The question is whether the provision denying the benefit of the differential to all who embark in the business after April 10, 1933, works a discrimination which has no foundation in the circumstances of those engaging in the milk business in New York City, and is therefore so unreasonable as to deny appellant the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The record discloses no reason for the discrimination. The report of the committee, pursuant to which the Milk Control Act was adopted, is silent on the subject. While the legislative history indicates that the differential provision was intended to preserve competitive conditions affecting the store trade in milk, it affords no clue to the genesis of the clause denying the benefit of the differential to those entering the business after April 10, 1933\n\n\n The Court of Appeals thought a possible reason for the time limitation might be that, without it, the companies having well-advertised names could, through subsidiaries, sell milk not bearing their names in competition with unadvertised dealers and thus drive some of the latter \n\n[297 U.S. 266, 273]\n\u00a0\n out of the field with consequent injury to the farmers who sell them milk. This view ignores the fact that the purchase price to the farmer is fixed and that the introduction of new unadvertised brands of bottled milk would not reduce the total demand for fluid milk in the metropolitan area. The appellees do not attempt now to support the provision on this ground.\n Another suggested reason for the discrimination is that the Legislature believed an equal price basis for all dealers would cause most of the business of selling milk through stores to pass into the hands of the large and well-known dealers; the differential provision was designed to prevent this result, and save existing businesses of the independent dealers, but was limited in its scope by the reason for it; the Legislature did not wish to increase the lower price competition against well advertised dealers by permitting new independent dealers to go into the business, and so required persons or corporations desiring to make investments in the milk business after April 10, 1933, to attach themselves to the higher price group. This is but another way of saying the Legislature determined that during the life of the law no person or corporation might enter the business of a milk dealer in New York City. The very reason for the differential was the belief that no one could successfully market an unadvertised brand on an even price basis with the seller of a well-advertised brand. One coming fresh into the field would not possess such a brand and clearly could not meet the competition of those having an established trade-name and good will, unless he were allowed the same differential as others in his class. By denying him this advantage the law effectually barred him from the business.\n We are referred to a host of decisions to the effect that a regulatory law may be prospective in operation and may except from its sweep those presently engaged in the calling or activity to which it is directed. Examples are stat- \n\n[297 U.S. 266, 274]\n\u00a0\n utes licensing physicians and dentists, which apply only to those entering the profession subsequent to the passage of the act and exempt those then in practice, or zoning laws which exempt existing buildings, or laws forbidding slaughterhouses within certain areas, but excepting existing establishm nts. The challenged provision is unlike such laws, since, on its face, it is not a regulation of a business or an activity in the interest of, or for the protection of, the public, but an attempt to give an economic advantage to those engaged in a given business at an arbitrary date as against all those who enter the industry after that date. The appellees do not intimate that the classification bears any relation to the public health or welfare generally; that the provision will discourage monopoly; or that it was aimed at any abuse, cognizable by law, in the milk business. In the absence of any such showing, we have no right to conjure up possible situations which might justify the discrimination. The classification is arbitrary and unreasonable and denies the appellant the equal protection of the law.\n At the argument we were asked to hold that if the time limitation be bad, it is severable, and the provision for the differential, shorn of it, remains in force; and we were referred to a section of the act claimed to show the Legislature so intended. While we have jurisdiction to decide the question, it is one which may appropriately be left for adjudication by the courts of New York, Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 291 S., 44 S.Ct. 323; Fox Film Corporation v. Muller, \n296 \nU.S. 207, 209\n, 210 S., 56 S.Ct. 183.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO (dissenting).\n The judgment just announced is irreconcilable in principle with the judgment in Borden's Case, \n297 \nU.S. 251\n, 56 S.Ct. 453, announced a minute or so earlier. \n\n[297 U.S. 266, 275]\n\u00a0\n A minimum price for fluid milk was fixed by law in April, 1933. At that time, 'independents' were underselling their competitors, the dealers in well-advertised brands, by approximately a cent a quart. There was reason to believe that unless that differential was preserved, they would be driven out of business. To give them an opportunity to survive, the lawmakers maintained the differential in the city of New York, the field of keenest competition. We have learned from the opinion in Borden's Case that this might lawfully be done.\n The problem was then forced upon the lawmakers, What were to be the privileges of independents who came upon the scene thereafter? Were they to have the benefit of a differential though they had not invested a dollar in the milk business at the passage of the act, or were they to take the chances of defeat by rivals stronger than themselves, as they would have to do in other callings? 'The Fourteenth Amendment does not protect a business against the hazards of competition.' Hegeman Farms Corporation v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 163, 170\n, 55 S.Ct. 7, 9; Public Service Commission v. Great Northern Utilities Co., \n289 \nU.S. 130, 135\n, 53 S.Ct. 546. To concede the differential to newcomers might mean an indefinite extension of an artificial preference, thereby aggravating the handicap, the factitious barrier to expansion, for owners of established brands. There was danger that the preference would become so general as to occupy an unfair proportion of the field, the statutory norm being thus disrupted altogether. On the other hand, to refuse the differential might mean that newcomers would be deterred from putting capital and labor at the risk of such a business, and, even if they chose to do so, would wage a losing fight.\n Hardships, great or little, were inevitable, whether the field of the differential was narrowed or enlarged. The legislature, and not the court, has been charged with the duty of determining their comparative extent. To some minds an expansion of the field might seem the course of \n\n[297 U.S. 266, 276]\n\u00a0\n wisdom and even that of duty; to others wisdom and duty might seem to point the other way. The judicial function is discharged when it appears from a survey of the scene that the lawmakers did not pay the part of arbitrary despots in choo ing as they did. Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582, 586\n, 587 S., 49 S.Ct. 430. When a line or point has to be fixed, and 'there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the Legislature must be accepted unless we can say that it is very wide of any reasonable mark.' Holmes, J., in Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 41\n, 48 S.Ct. 423, 426. Cf. Dominion Hotel v. Arizona, \n249 \nU.S. 265, 268\n, 269 S., 39 S.Ct. 273. The judgment of the court commits us to a larger role. In declaring the equities of newcomers to be not inferior to those of others, the judgment makes a choice between competing considerations of policy and fairness, however emphatic its professions that it applies a rule of law.\n For the situation was one to tax the wisdom of the wisest. At the very least, it was a situation where thoughtful and honest men might see their duty differently. The statute upheld by this court in Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469, was an experiment, and a novel one, in that form of business enterprise. Relations between groups had grown up and crystallized under cover of the re gime of unrestricted competition. They were threatened with disruption by a system of regulated prices which might crowd the little dealers out and leave the strong and the rich in possession of the field. If there was to be dislocation of the price structure by the action of the state, there was a duty, or so the lawmakers might believe, to spread the consequences among the groups with a minimum of change and hence a minimum of hardship. But the position of men in business at the beginning of the change was very different from those who might go into the business afterwards. Those already there would lose something more than an opportunity for a choice between one business and another. They would lose cap- \n\n[297 U.S. 266, 277]\n\u00a0\n ital already ventured; they would lose experience already bought; they would suffer the pains incidental to the sudden and enforced abandonment of an accustomed way of life. A newcomer could not pretend that he was exposed to those afflictions. Then, too, the ephemeral character of the project counted heavily in favor of the older dealers, and little in favor of a newcomer, or rather, indeed, against him. The system of regulation had been set up as a temporary one, to tide producers over the rigors of the great depression. If independents already in the field could have their business saved from ruin, it might come back to them intact when the statute was no longer needed. Those who went into the system later would have to count the cost.\n Considerations akin to these have seemed sufficient to other Legislatures for drawing a distinction between an old business and a new one. They have seemed sufficient to this court in determining the validity of other acts of legislation not different in principle. Stanley v. Utilities Commission of Maine, \n295 \nU.S. 76, 78\n, 55 S.Ct. 628; Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, \n286 \nU.S. 352, 370\n, 371 S., 52 S.Ct. 595, 81 A.L.R. 1402; Sperry & Hutchinson Co. v. Rhodes, \n220 \nU.S. 502, 505\n, 31 S.Ct. 490; Watson v. Maryland, \n218 \nU.S. 173, 177\n, 178 S., 30 S.Ct. 644; cf. Spector v. Building Inspector, 250 Mass. 63, 70, 71, 145 N.E. 265. Independents who were in business when the statute was adopted would not have suffered a denial of a constitutional right or privilege if they had been refused a differential, though the refusal might have condemned them to a foreordained and hopeless struggle with advertised competitors stronger than themselves. For the same reason, independents starting afterwards must submit to the same chances unless their equities are as commanding as those of dealers on the scene before. It is juggling with words to say that all the independents make up a single 'class,' and by reason of that fact must be subjected to a single rule. Whether the class is divisible into subclass  is the very question to be answered. There may \n\n[297 U.S. 266, 278]\n\u00a0\n be division and subdivision unless separation can be found to be so void of rationality as to be the expression of a whim rather than an exercise of judgment. 'We have no right,' it is now said, 'to conjure up possible situations which might justify the discrimination.' The court has taught a different doctrine in its earlier decisions. 'A statutory discrimination will not be set aside as the denial of equal protection of the laws if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.' Metropolitan Casualty Insurance Co. v. Brownell, \n294 \nU.S. 580, 584\n, 55 S.Ct. 538, 540; Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 36 S.Ct. 370, L.R.A.1917A, 421, Ann.Cas.1917B, 455; O'Gorman & Young v.

Big dealers and little ones, newcomers in the trade and veterans, were clamorously asserting to the Legislature their title to its favor. I have not seen the judicial scales so delicately poised and so accurately graduated as to balance and record the subtleties of all these rival equities, and make them ponderable and legible beyond a reasonable doubt.\n To say that the statute is not void beyond a reasonable doubt is to say that it is valid.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Laws 1933 (N.Y.) chap. 158.

UNITED STATES(1936)\nNo. 552\nArgued: March 30, 1936Decided: May 18, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 342, 343]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Julius Russell Cades and Urban Earl Wild, both of Honolulu, Hawaii, for petitioners.\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Harry W. Blair, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought in the United States District Court for the Territory of Hawaii by the government against petitioners to condemn 4,080 acres of land on the Island of Oahu for a federal public purpose. The territorial law provides that in such a suit the value of the land and the value of the improvements thereon must be separately assessed. A common- law jury was impaneled, heard the case, and returned a verdict for petitioners fixing the value of the land at $206,503.51, and the value of the improvements thereon at $14,000. Judgment was entered in accordance with the verdict. On appeal to the court below, the judgment was affirmed ( C.C.A.) 74 F.(2d) 596.\n The questions for our consideration are whether the ruling of the trial court refusing to admit certain evidence and offers of evidence was erroneous, and, if so, whether the rejection of such evidence may be disregarded as not substantially prejudicial under section 269 of the Judicial Code as amended (28 U.S.C.A.  391).\n First. The lands sought to be condemned were i use, and had been used for many years, as a cattle ranch, although pineapples had been grown upon some small areas. The owners had in view the ultimate use of the lands for the growing of sugar cane, which would require the bringing of water from a distance for irrigation purposes. Testimony was introduced to the effect that upwards of 3,000 acres of the tract were suitable for growing cane, and would produce an average of 70 to 75 tons \n\n[298 U.S. 342, 344]\n\u00a0\n of sugar cane to the acre, from which could be extracted eight or nine tons of sugar to the acre; and that the contour of the land was favorable to irrigation, and its general condition such as to make it adaptable to the purposes of a sugar plantation. Petitioners offered to prove that they had been for many years negotiating for the development of a sugar plantation on the land; that there were three sources of water supply, from one or the other of which petitioners had every reason to expect water would have been developed for the lands in question had it not been for the present suit; that any prospective purchaser of the lands would, at the time this suit was brought, take into consideration the reasonableness of the possibility of securing a supply of water for the purpose of raising sugar cane; that sugar cane lands in the territory generally require the bringing of water from other lands for irrigation, and that the availability of water for such purpose is a factor in determining the value of prospective sugar cane lands; that such water in many instances is transported much greater distances than would be required in the pending case; that there are available artesian basins from which for many years fresh artesian water has been and is available, unused and flowing to waste, amounting to approximately 60,000,000 gallons per day; that petitioners own lands within these basins upon which wells may be sunk at distances of from eight to ten-and-one-half miles from the tract in question, and the water last described recovered; that it was practically and economically feasible to transport such water from the lands within these basins to the tract in question; that the cost of recovering and transporting such water would render the use of it economically feasible and profitable; and that such recovery and use of the water could be anticipated with reasonable certainty.\n Petitioners offered further to prove that the surplus water could be captured and transported practicably and \n\n[298 U.S. 342, 345]\n\u00a0\n economically and used profitably for the cultivation of sugar cane; and that the cost of recovering the water and transporting it would be less per million gallons than that incurred for recovery and transportation of water to other cane lands on the Island of Oahu and other islands in the territory.\n These offers, and evidence of a similar character sought to be elicited from witnesses, were rejected by the trial court upon the ground that the possibility of bringing water from outside sources was too remote and speculative.\n At the conclusion of the evidence, the court gave the following instruction to the jury:\n'In estimating the compensation to be paid to the owners of the land which the government here seeks to condemn, I instruct you that you must entirely disregard any possibility of bringing water to the land in question from any other land, excepting the land which the government here seeks to condemn and the 284 acre tract, Lot B 1 A.'\n\n The 284-acre tract referred to is owned by petitioners, and adjoins the land sought to be condemned.\n The rule is well settled that, in condemnation cases, the most profitable use to which the land can probably be put in the reasonably near future may be shown and considered as bearing upon the market value; and the fact that such use can be made only in connection with other lands does not necessarily exclude it from consideration if the possibility of such connection is reasonably sufficient to affect market value. Olson v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 246, 255\n, 256 S., 54 S.Ct. 704, 78 .Ed. 1236\n\n\n That the greater part of the land here sought to be condemned was adapted to the successful growth of sugar cane if provided with sufficient water for irrigation is not controverted. Proof that a supply of water was available and might be brought to the land at an expense con- \n\n[298 U.S. 342, 346]\n\u00a0\n sistent with its profitable use was therefore relevant and material. And this the evidence offered tended to establish. The ruling of the trial court rejecting the offers and its instruction to the jury to disregard the possibility of bringing water from lands other than the land sought to be condemned and the 284-acre tract adjoining were erroneous. This is well pointed out by the court below, and we see no occasion to enlarge upon its opinion.\n The government now contends that the offer was insufficient because it does not exhibit an intention to show how much the value of the land would be increased or the probable cost of the irrigation improvement. The evidence offered was material and relevant to the issue so far as it went. No objection was made on the part of the government such as is now urged. The objection specifically was that the possibility of bringing water from outside sources was too remote and speculative; and it is that objection which the trial court sustained. The ruling went not to the sufficiency of the offer, but to the materiality of the evidence. If it had been suggested or held that the offer was incomplete, it is not unfair, when we consider the nature of the specific matters named, to assume that the evidence in respect of them could have been supplied. In that view what was said by the Supreme Court of California in Palmer v. McCafferty, 15 Cal. 334, 335, is pertinent:\n'All that the Court can ask is, that the particular evidence offered conduces to establish any one proposition involved in the issue. ... There must be a starting place somewhere, and the Court should never reject evidence merely because, unaided by other testimony, it is insufficient, if it tend legally to prove any part of the case.'\n\n An offer of proof cannot be denied as remote or speculative because it does not cover every fact necessary to prove the issue. If it be an appropriate link in the chain of proof, that is enough. \n\n[298 U.S. 342, 347]\n\u00a0\n Second. The court below, while ruling that the rejection of the evidence was erroneous, held that it was not prejudicial error within the terms of section 269 of the Judicial Code, as amended (28 U.S.C.  391, 28 U.S.C.A.  391), reproduced in the margin.* The court thought the offers of proof were not sufficiently specific to enable it to say that the rejection, although erroneous, was prejudicial. Apparently what was meant by the offers not being sufficiently specific, as indicated by a statement earlier in the opinion, is that they did not show what would be the value of the land when reclaimed, nor the cost of developing and delivering a sufficient water supply. But that seems to be the exact basis of the government's contention that the offer was not complete, which, affirming the court below, we have just held is without merit. We think equally it constitutes no ground for sustaining the ruling of the trial court as nonprejudicial. The action of the trial court in rejecting the offers plainly meant that it would be useless to offer further evidence supplementing and dependent upon that which had been rejected. Faced with that ruling and implication, counsel was not required to offer further evidence along that line. Cf. Rogers v. Brent, 5 Gilman (10 Ill.) 573, 588, 589, 50 Am.Dec. 422.\n In this situation, section 269 is not controlling. That section simply requires that judgment on review shal be given after an examination of the entire record 'without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.' This, as the language plainly shows, does not change the well- settled rule that an erroneous ruling which relates to the substantial rights of a party is ground for reversal unless \n\n[298 U.S. 342, 348]\n\u00a0\n it affirmatively appears from the whole record that it was not prejudicial. United States v. River Rouge Co., \n269 \nU.S. 411, 421\n, 46 S.Ct. 144; Fillippon v. Albion Vein Slate Co., \n250 \nU.S. 76, 82\n, 39 S.Ct. 435; Williams v. Great Southern Lumber Co., \n277 \nU.S. 19, 26\n, 48 S.Ct. 417.\n This the record does not disclose. In an eminent-domain proceeding, the vital issue-and generally the only issue-is that of just compensation. The proof here offered necessarily related to the value of the land when used for a purpose to which it probably could be put within the rule laid down by the Olson Case, supra. To exclude from the consideration of the jury evidence of this elementary character could not be otherwise than prejudicial.\n We find no reason to differ with the holding of the court below as to the inadmissibility of evidence respecting the rent paid for other lands. It is unnecessary to consider whether the error was prejudicial, because the question cannot arise upon another trial.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] 'On the hearing of any appeal, certiorari, writ of error, or motion for a new trial, in any case, civil or criminal, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the entire record before the court, without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.' \n\n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCAUGHN v.

Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Franklin S. Edmonds, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n On February 9, 1920, Malcolm MacFarlan, a physician of Philadelphia, Pa., made a transfer of real estate and securities, of the value of upwards of $670,000, in trust for the benefit of his children and their wives and descendants. He died on December 8, 1921. As his death occurred within two years after the transfer, it fell within the terms of the statute creating a pre- \n\n[297 U.S. 606, 607]\n\u00a0\n sumption that the transfer was made in contemplation of death. Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136,  402(c), 42 Stat. 227, 277, 278. The remaining estate of the decedent, of which disposition was made by will (executed on the same day as the transfer in trust) was worth about $13,000. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue included the property transferred as part of decedent's gross estate, and demanded payment of an estate tax upon that basis. The payment was made, claim for refund was rejected, and this suit was brought by t e executors of the decedent against the collector to recover the amount paid.\n A jury was waived. After the evidence had been received, both parties submitted requests for conclusions of law, and plaintiffs also requested special findings of fact. The court refused plaintiffs' requests and affirmed certain conclusions of law requested by defendant and plaintiffs were allowed exceptions.\n Referring to decedent's physical condition, the court said in its opinion that the evidence showed that at the time of the transfer decedent was 78 years old, unusually vigorous and clear-minded, and, except for a condition common in men of his age, in good health. The court said that the most that could be claimed for that evidence was that it established, and the court specifically found, that the transfer was not made 'under any consciousness or belief or apprehension that death was imminent.' The substance of the court's conclusion on all the evidence was that 'the plaintiffs have failed to show that the motive that induced this transfer, whatever it was, was not of the sort which leads to testamentary disposition, and, consequently, have failed to meet the burden of proof placed upon them by the statute.' The court then found a general verdict in favor of the defendant and directed judgment accordingly. (D.C.) 7 F. Supp. 742, 744. \n\n[297 U.S. 606, 608]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the evidence, decided that the transfer was not made in contemplation of death, and reversed the judgment. 79 F.(2d) 602.\n The principles governing the determination whether a gift inter vivos is made 'in contemplation of death' are set forth in United States v. Wells, \n283 \nU.S. 102\n, 51 S.Ct. 446, and need not be restated. The instant case is controlled by the established rules relating to appellate review in actions at law where a jury trial has been waived. Rev. St.  649, 700, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  773, 875 (28 U.S.C.A.  773, 875). Where a general verdict is found by the trial court, it has the same effect as the verdict of a jury. The appellate court cannot pass upon the weight of evidence. Norris v. Jackson, 9 Wall. 125, 128; British Queen Mining Co. v. Baker Silver Mining Co., \n139 \nU.S. 222\n, 11 S.Ct. 523; Lehnen v.

That question does not appear to be substantial. The ultimate question for the decision of the trial court was one of fact and its general verdict was conclusive. The Circuit Court of Appeals was without authority to weigh the evidence and to make its own findings.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCKEY v. PARADISE (U.S. REPORTS TITLE: MCKEE V. PARADISE(1936)\n\nArgued: October 12, 1936Decided: December 7, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. E. Leahy and Wm. J. Hughes, Jr., both of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Stanford Clinton, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent. \n\n[299 U.S. 119, 120]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question relates to the propriety of a preference allowed in a bankruptcy proceeding upon the ground of a constructive trust.\n The facts were stipulated. The bankrupt, Grigsby-Grunow, Inc., maintained an unincorporated welfare association, known as the Majestic Employees Welfare Association, to provide life, health, and accident insurance for its employees. The association was governed by its own officers and had its own bank account. The funds of the association were invested in United States securities and the earnings and increment of these investments were used for the contemplated insurance benefits. The initial membership fee of one dollar and weekly dues of twenty-five cents were 'automatically deducted' from the wages of each employee who had been employed for the required period. Before February 4, 1933, the bankrupt regularly paid to the association the accumulations of each payroll deduction, less such expenses of the association as were paid by the bankrupt. From the date above-mentioned, the bankrupt fell into arrears and until November 24, 1933, when receivers in equity were appointed, there was always an unpaid balance to the credit of the association. That balance at the time of the receivership amounted to $14,607.51. The deductions from wages were made by charging the employee's account on the payroll records of the bankrupt and crediting the aggregate of all such deductions to the account of the association on the books of the bankrupt. 'No actual money was taken from the pay envelopes of the employees and deposited in any account of the bankrupt, but to the contrary the matter was handled as a mere bookkeeping entry' and at no time did the bankrupt 'segregate' any money due the association or 'deposit any money in any separate trust account \n\n[299 U.S. 119, 121]\n\u00a0\n or bank account.' The practice of the bankrupt was to deposit all its incoming revenue in its general bank account, from which it would from time to time withdraw moneys and establish various special accounts. The bankrupt was accustomed to withdraw from its general account or special accounts as the convenience of the situation required, and the pay roll was drawn from the various accounts, both general and special, indiscriminately.\n In August, 1933, the association was formally dissolved and, after setting up a fund to cover certain contingent obligations, all the other assets were conveyed to another unincorporated association, known as the Majestic Works Council, in which the bankrupt and its employees had equal representation. The Works Council appointed the respondent, Maurice Paradise, as trustee and authorized him to take proceedings to enforce its claim. It also appeared that subsequent to February 4, 1933, payment of the sums due the association had been demanded, and that payment had been requested from the equity receivers and refused.\n The bankruptcy proceeding was begun in February, 1934, and respondent petitioned for the allowance of a preferential claim against the bankrupt's estate. The referee allowed the claim but his decision was reversed by the District Judge upon the ground that there was no trust and that, even if there was, the trust funds had not been traced into the hands of the trustee in bankruptcy. This ruling was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals which held that a trust had been created and that the preference should be allowed. In re Grigsby-Grunow, 80 F.(2d) 478. In view of the contention of the petitioner that the decision was in conflict with applicable decisions of this Court, we granted certiorari. McKey v. Paradise, \n298 \nU.S. 647\n, 56 S.Ct. 675\n\n\n We think that the facts afford no adequate basis for the conclusion that a trust existed. The underlying rela- \n\n[299 U.S. 119, 122]\n\u00a0\n tion was that of employer and employee. With respect to wages that the employee earned, the relation was that of debtor and creditor. By agreement, a part of the amounts thus becoming due as wages was to be paid to the association. What would otherwise be a debt to the employee was to become a debt to the association. Whether the agreement be viewed as an assignment by the employee to the association of the claim to the part of the wages as the latter became due, or as a novation, the result was that the bankrupt owed the association the agreed sums. The book entries of debits on the payroll records and credits to the association evidenced that understanding.\n It does not appear that it was contemplated that the bankrupt should accumulate or hold any fund. On the contrary, the practice prior to February, 1933, was that the bankrupt regularly paid to the association the agreed amounts. The later failure to pay did not alter the nature of the transaction. The bankrupt was a debtor which had failed to pay its debt. We know of no principle upon which that failure can be treated as a conversion of property held in trust. At no time throughout the whole period was there a trust fund or res. No fund was segregated or set up by special deposit or in any manner. When the wages became due, there was no such fund but only the general assets of the employer and its obligation to pay a debt. The agreement of the employer to pay the association instead of the employee did not give to the employee or the association equitable title to or lien upon any part of the employer's property. The assets of the employer remained, as they were before, general assets. It would be impossible to state all the circumstances in which equity will fasten a constructive trust upon property in order to frustrate a violation of fiduciary duty. See 3 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence,  1044 et seq. But the mere failure to pay a debt does \n\n[299 U.S. 119, 123]\n\u00a0\n not belong in that category. We do not find that the record shows anything more than that in this instance. Our observations in Adams v. Champion, \n294 \nU.S. 231, 238\n, 55 S.Ct. 399, 402, to which the Court of Appeals refers, have no relation to such a case. See National City Bank v. Hotchkiss, \n231 \nU.S. 50\n, 34 S.Ct. 20; Blakey v. Brinson, \n286 \nU.S. 254\n, 52 S.Ct. 516, 82 A.L.R. 1288; Jennings v. United States F. & G.

The fact that the failure to pay the association was an acute disappointment, and was especially regrettable as the claimant was an association of employees, cannot avail to change the debtor into a trustee or enable the creditor to obtain a preference over other claims against a bankrupt estate.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court is affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCNUTT v.

Philip Lutz, Jr., Atty. Gen., Joseph W. Hutchinson, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Leo M. Gardner, of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellants.\n Messrs. John Thomas Smith, Phillip W. Haberman, and Duane R. Dills, all of New York City, and Paul Y. Davis, of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, General Motors Acceptance Corporation of Indiana, brought this suit to restrain the enforcement of chapter 231 of the Acts of 1935 of the General Assembly of Indiana. That act provides for the regulation of the business of purchasing contracts arising out of retail installment sales, including provisions for licenses, for classifications of contracts, and for fixing maximum 'finance charges.' The validity of the act was challenged as depriving respondent of its property without due process of law and denying it the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. An interlocutory injunction was sought and, upon hearing by three judges (28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380), a final decree was entered, upon findings of facts and conclusions of law, granting a permanent injunction. No opinion was rendered. The case comes here by direct appeal.\n The question arises whether the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, so as to give the District Court jurisdiction. Jud.Code,  24(1), 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S. C.A.  41(1). The complaint alleged that the requisite amount was involved and this \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n allegation was denied by the answer. On the argument in this Court, leave was given to file an additional brief upon the question of jurisdiction and respondent has submitted its brief accordingly.\n Respondent points to the allegations of its bill that the 'net worth' of its business exceeds $50,000; that in 1934 it purchased retail installment contracts in Indiana aggregating in excess of $7,000,000; that the value of such purchases for the first six months of 1935 was in excess of $4,000,000; and that during 1934 respondent purchased in Indiana approximately 23,000 installment sales contracts from more than 500 retail dealers. These allegations were sustained by the findings of the District Court. The bill also alleged that respondent maintained offices in Indiana for which it paid yearly an aggregate rental of $13,147; that it employed on the average 85 employees whose aggregate annual salaries amounted to about $150,000. Respondent also refers to its allegations that the act limits the amount which respondent 'may receive as its gross profit for the purchase of an installment contract to a sum not exceeding the maximum 'finance charge' which may be fixed by the Department of Financial Institutions,' by prohibiting respondent 'from purchasing any retail installment contracts at a less price than the unpaid balance thereon'; that the act limits the amount which may be given by respondent 'to retail sellers out of the gross 'finance charge' received from retail buyers under installment sale contracts' sold to respondent, by requiring the Department 'to fix this maximum amount without regard to any differentiation as between contracts sold to licensees by retail sellers with recourse against such sellers, and contracts sold by retail sellers without recourse against them'; and that in other respects the statute imposes burdensome requirements which impair the 'efficiency of the operations and earnings' of respondent. \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n Respondent invokes the principle that jurisdiction is to be tested by the value of the object or right to be protected against interference. Hunt v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n205 \nU.S. 322\n, 27 S.Ct. 529; Bitterman v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n207 \nU.S. 205\n, 28 S.Ct. 91, 12 Ann.Cas. 693; Berryman v. Board of Trustees of Whitman College, \n222 \nU.S. 334\n, 32 S.Ct. 147; Glenwood Light Co. v. Mutual Light Co., \n239 \nU.S. 121\n, 36 S.Ct. 30; Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263\n, 54 S.Ct. 700. But in the instant case, the statute does not attempt to prevent respondent from conducting its business. There is no showing that it cannot obtain a license and proceed with its operations. The value or net worth of the business which respondent transacts in Indiana is not involved save to the extent that it may be affected by the incidence of the statutory regulation. The object or right to be protected against unconstitutional interference is the right to be free of that regulation. The value of that right may be measured by the loss, if any, which would follow the enforcement of the rules prescribed. The particular allegations of respondent's bill as to the extent or value of its business throw no light upon that subject. They fail to set forth any facts showing what, if any, curtailment of business and consequent loss the enforcement of the statute would involve. The bill is thus destitute of any appropriate allegation as to jurisdictional amount save the general allegation that the matter in controversy exceeds $ 3,000. That allegation was put in issue and the record discloses neither finding nor evidence to sustain it.\n In the absence of any showing in the record to support that general allegation, the question is upon which party lay the burden of proof. Respondent contends that the burden of proving the lack of jurisdiction rests upon the party challenging the jurisdiction and cites decisions of this Court to that effect. The question is thus sharply presented. \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n The jurisdiction of the District Court in a civil suit of this nature is definitely limited by statute to one-'where the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000, and ( a) arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority, or (b) is between citizens of different States, or (c) is between citizens of a State and foreign States, citizens, or subjects.' Jud.Code,  24(1), 28 U.S.C.  41( 1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1).\n Further, the Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137,  5 (18 Stat. 472) as now applied to the District Courts (Jud.Code,  37, 28 U.S.C.  80, 28 U.S.C.A .  80), explicitly charges those courts with the duty of enforcing these jurisdictional limitations. The provision in its present form is as follows: 'If in any suit commenced in a district court, or remove from a State court to a district court of the United States, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said district court, at any time after such suit has been brought or removed thereto, that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said district court, or that the parties to said suit have been improperly or collusively made or joined, either as plaintiffs or defendants, for the purpose of creating a case cognizable or removable under this chapter, the said district court shall proceed no further therein, but shall dismiss the suit or remand it to the court from which it was removed, as justice may require, and shall make such order as to costs as shall be just.'\n It is incumbent upon the plaintiff properly to allege the jurisdictional facts, according to the nature of the case.' 'Where the law gives no rule, the demand of the plaintiff must furnish one; but where the law gives the rule, the legal cause of action, and not the plaintiff's demand, must be regarded.' Wilson v. Daniel, 3 Dall. \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n 401, 407, 408; Barry v. Edmunds, \n116 \nU.S. 550, 560\n, 6 S.Ct. 501; Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. (No. 2), \n170 \nU.S. 468, 481\n, 18 S.Ct. 645; Lion Bonding Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 85\n, 86 S., 43 S.Ct. 480. Where the pleadings properly alleged the jurisdictional facts, as, for example, with respect to diversity of citizenship and jurisdictional amount, it was necessary at common law, and before the passage of the act of 1875, to raise the issue of want of jurisdiction by plea in abatement. And where the jurisdictional issue was thus raised, the burden of proof was upon the defendant. The objection was waived by pleading to the merits. D'Wolf v. Rabaud, 1 Pet. 476, 498; Sheppard v. Graves, 14 How. 505, 510; De Sobry v. Nicholson, 3 Wall. 420, 423; Farmington v. Pillsbury, \n114 \nU.S. 138, 143\n, 5 S.Ct. 807. In equity, the defense could be presented by plea or demurrer but not by answer. Livingston v. Story, 11 Pet. 351, 393; De Sobry v. Nicholson, supra; Hunt v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n205 \nU.S. 322, 333\n, 27 S.Ct. 529. Demurrers and pleas were abolished by Rule 29 of the Equity Rules promulgated in 1912. 226 U.S. appendix p. 8.\n By the Conformity Act of 1872 (17 Stat. 197; R.S.  914; 28 U.S.C.  724, 28 U.S.C.A.  724), all defenses in civil actions at law were made available to a defendant in the federal courts under any form of plea, answer, or demurrer which would have been open to him under like pleading in the courts of the state within which the federal court was held. In that view we decided that where, under the Nebraska Code of Civil Procedure, the answer took the place of all pleas at common law, in abatement or to the merits, the allegation of the citizenship of the parties, which was properly made in the petition and put in issue by the answer, must be proved by the plaintiff. And where the record showed 'no proof or finding upon this essential point' the judgment was reversed for want of jurisdiction. Roberts v. Lewis, \n144 U.S. 653\n, 656-658, 12 S.Ct. 781, 783. See, to \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 184]\n\u00a0\n the same effect, Wells Company v. Gastonia Company, \n198 \nU.S. 177, 182\n, 25 S.Ct. 640\n\n\n The act of 1875, in placing upon the trial court the duty of enforcing the statutory limitations as to jurisdiction by dismissing or remanding the cause at any time when the lack of jurisdiction appears, applies to both actions at law and suits in equity. The trial court is not bound by the pleadings of the parties, but may, of its own motion, if led to believe that its jurisdiction is not properly invoked, 'inquire into the facts as they really exist.' Wetmore v. Rymer, \n169 \nU.S. 115, 120\n, 18 S. Ct. 293, 295; Gilbert v. David, \n235 \nU.S. 561, 567\n, 35 S.Ct. 164, 166; North Pacific Steamship Co. v. Soley, \n257 \nU.S. 216, 221\n, 42 S.Ct. 87, 88, 66 L Ed. 203. This Court has had occasion to consider the upplication of the statute under varying conditions. See Barry v. Edmunds, supra; Morris v. Gilmer, \n129 \nU.S. 315\n, 9 S.Ct. 289; Deputron v. Young, \n134 \nU.S. 241\n, 10 S.Ct. 539; Anderson v. Watt, \n138 \nU.S. 694, 701\n, 11 S.Ct. 449, 450; Wetmore v. Rymer, supra; Steigleder v. McQuesten, \n198 \nU.S. 141, 143\n, 25 S. Ct. 616; Gilbert v. David, supra; North Pacific Steamship Co. v. Soley, supra; Broad-Grace Corporation v. Bright, \n284 \nU.S. 588\n, 52 S.Ct. 137.\n In Anderson v. Watt, supra, a suit in equity, the Court said that under the act of 1875 'the objection to the jurisdiction upon a denial of the averment of citizenship is not confined to a plea in abatement or a demurrer, but may be taken in the answer, and the time at which it may be raised is not restricted.' In Wetmore v. Rymer, supra, an action of ejectment, after a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, the trial court set them aside and entertained defendant's motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, giving leave to both parties to file affidavits showing the value of the land in controversy. Upon consideration of the evidence, the trial court decided that the jurisdictional amount was not involved. This Court disagreed with that conclusion. Speaking of the effect of \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 185]\n\u00a0\n the act of 1875, the Court observed that the statute did not prescribe any particular mode in which the question of jurisdiction was to be brought to the attention of the court, nor how, when raised, it should be determined. The Court said: 'When such a question rises in an action at law, its decision would usually depend upon matters of fact, and also usually involves a denial of formal, but necessary, allegations contained in the plaintiff's declaration or complaint. Such a case would be presented when the plaintiff's allegation that the controversy was between citizens of different states, or when, as in the present case, the allegation that the matter in dispute was of sufficient value to give the court jurisdiction, was denied. In such cases, whether the question was raised by the defendant or by the court on its own motion, the court might doubtless order the issue to be tried by the jury.' But 'the questions might arise in such a a shape that the court might consider and determine them without the intervention of a jury' and 'it would appear to have been the intention of congress to leave the mode of raising and trying such issues to the discretion of the trial judge.'\n In Gilbert v. David, supra, an action at law in the federal court in Connecticut, the question arose with respect to the citizenship of the plaintiff-which was put in issue by defendants' answer. Later, defendants moved to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction. Plaintiff then moved to strike that motion from the files upon the ground that it was an irregular method of raising the question and because the matter was already in issue under the pleadings. Taking that view, the trial court directed the trial to proceed upon the question of jurisdiction, and upon hearing the testimony the court found that both parties were citizens of Connecticut and dismissed the action. The judgment was affirmed by this Court. The Court said: 'Under the former practice, \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 186]\n\u00a0\n before the passage of the act of 1875 ... it was necessary to raise the issue of citizenship by a plea in abatement, when the pleadings properly averred the citizenship of the parties. ... The objection may be made now by answer before answering to the merits, or it may be made by motion . ... It may be raised by a general denial in the answer, where the state practice permits of that course. Roberts v. Lewis, \n144 \nU.S. 653\n, 12 S.Ct. 781. In the state of Connecticut, under the form of denial contained in this answer, the answer raised the issue. ... Moreover, the parties to the suit regarded the matter as at issue under the pleadings, and it was so held by the court. ... The question was prop rly before the court.' The Court further held that while the question might have been submitted to the jury, the trial court was not bound to take that course and that it was its privilege to dispose of the issue upon the testimony. From the citation of Robert v. Lewis, supra, it is apparent that the Court considered that the burden of proof upon the issue of citizenship was upon the plaintiff, and it also appeared from the record that the plaintiff assumed that burden upon the trial.\n In North Pacific Steamship Co. v. Soley, supra, the suit was in equity and the question was whether the jurisdictional amount was involved. The plaintiff's allegation to that effect was denied by the answer. Upon hearing the evidence offered by the complainant, and that of the defendant, the trial court held that the jurisdictional amount was not involved and dismissed the suit. On direct appeal to this Court, under the former practice where jurisdictional questions alone were presented, the Court said: 'The objection that jurisdiction to entertain the suit did not exist is one which may be taken by answer. Anderson v. Watt, \n138 \nU.S. 694\n, 11 S. Ct. 449. Indeed, under section 37 it is the duty of the court when it shall appear to its satisfaction that the suit does not really and substan- \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 187]\n\u00a0\n tially involve the necessary amount to give it jurisdiction, to dismiss the same, and this the court may do whether the parties raise the question or not. In the present case the issue was raised by answer, and, therefore, it became necessary for the court to determine the question of jurisdiction upon the facts presented, and when brought directly here, it is the duty of this Court to review the decision upon the testimony as one presenting a jurisdictional question.' The Court then considered the facts and sustained the ruling of the District Court.\n The question of the burden of proof was considered by this Court in Chase v. Wetzlar, \n225 \nU.S. 79\n, 32 S.Ct. 659, 662. That was a suit in equity in the federal court in New York to enforce 'equitable liens upon or claims to the title of personal property,' and jurisdiction depended on the presence of the property within the district. 18 Stat. 472; Jud. Code,  57, 28 U.S.C.  118, 28 U.S.C.A.  118. The allegation of the bill that the property was within the district was traversed by the plea, which was held to be 'sufficient in law and form,' and to which a general replication was filed. The case was heard upon the pleadings and the trial court ruled that the burden was upon the complainant to establish the existence of the essential jurisdictional facts which the plea traversed, and as no proof had been offered by the complainant the bill was dismissed for the lack of jurisdiction. On direct appeal this Court affirmed the decree.\n As to the contention that the defendant was bound to prove the allegations of his plea, the Court observed: 'The theory as to the burden of proof being on the defendant, on which this proposition proceeds, it is insisted, is sanctioned by the following decisions of this court. Sheppard v. Graves (1852) 14 How. 505; De Sobry v. Nicholson (1865) 3 Wall. 420; Wetmore v. Rymer (1898) \n169 \nU.S. 115\n, 18 S.Ct. 293, and Hunt v. New York Cotton Exchange (1907) \n205 \nU.S. 322\n, 27 S.Ct. 529. And a decision of the cir- \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 188]\n\u00a0\n cuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit in Hill v. Walker, 92 C.C.A. 633, 167 F. 241, is also referred to as containing a full summary of the decided cases on the subject.' The Court distinguished those cases upon the ground that none of them involved the question of jurisdiction under the statute requiring the presence of property within the district. In view of that distinction, the Court thought it unnecessary 'to now consider the conflict of opinion which has sometimes arisen concerning whether the doctrine of the cases relied upon and the fundamental conception upon which those cases rested entirely harmonizes with t e provision of the act of 1875, requiring a Federal court of its own motion to dismiss a pending suit when it is found not to be really within its jurisdiction,-see Roberts v. Lewis, \n144 \nU.S. 653\n, 12 S.Ct. 781, and the cases cited in the dissenting opinion in Hill v. Walker, supra,' because the Court thought that the doctrine was inapplicable to the case before it. The existence of property within the jurisdiction was deemed to be such a fundamental prerequisite to the exercise of power to render a binding decree that in no possible view could it be said that the plaintiff did not have the burden of proving the essential jurisdictional fact. The Court concluded its discussion of the point by saying: 'In other words, even putting aside, for the sake of argument, the effect on the doctrines announced in the decisions relied upon of the enactment of the act of 1875 as to the duty to dismiss to which we have referred, the burden of proof to establish that the court was vested with power to act, we think in a case like this, in the nature of things, rested upon the complainant.' Chase v. Wetzlar, supra, \n225 U.S. 79\n, at pages 85-87, 32 S. Ct. 659, 663.\n The question which was thus suggested and put aside in Chase v. Wetzlar is definitely before us in the instant case and should be decided. The act of 1875 prescribes a uniform rule and there should be a consistent practice in dealing with jurisdictional questions. We think that \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 189]\n\u00a0\n the terms and implications of the act leave no sufficient ground for varying rules as to the burden of proof. The prerequisites to the exercise of jurisdiction are specifically defined and the plain import of the statute is that the District Court is vested with authority to inquire at any time whether these conditions have been met. They are conditions which must be met by the party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor. He must allege in his pleading the facts essential to show jurisdiction. If he fails to make the necessary allegations he has no standing. If he does make them, an inquiry into the existence of jurisdiction is obviously for the purpose of determining whether the facts support his allegations. In the nature of things, the authorized inquiry is primarily directed to the one who claims that the power of the court should be exerted in his behalf. As he is seeking relief subject to this supervision, it follows that he must carry throughout the litigation the burden of showing that he is properly in court. The authority which the statute vests in the court to enforce the limitations of its jurisdiction precludes the idea that jurisdiction may be maintained by mere averment or that the party asserting jurisdiction may be relieved of his burden by any formal procedure. If his allegations of jurisdictional facts are challenged by his adversary in any appropriate manner, he must support them by competent proof. And where they are not so challenged the court may still insist that the jurisdictional facts be established or the case be dismissed, and for that purpose the court may demand that the party alleging jurisdiction justify his allegations by a preponderance of evidence. We think that only in this way may the practice of the District Courts be harmonized with the true intent of the statute which clothes them with adequate authority and imposes upon them a correlative duty. \n\n[298 U.S. 178, 190]\n\u00a0\n Here, the allegation in the bill of complaint as to jurisdictional amount was traversed by the answer. The court made no adequate finding upon that issue of fact, and the record contains no evidence to support the allegation of the bill. There was thus no showing that the District Court had jurisdiction and the bill should have been dismissed upon that ground.\n The decree is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint for the want of jurisdiction.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration and decision of thi case. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCNUTT v.

Respondent, McHenry Chevrolet Co., Inc., is a dealer, selling automobiles at retail for cash or on the installment plan. It brought this suit to restrain the enforcement of chapter 231 of the Acts of 1935 of the General Assembly of Indiana, providing for the regulation of the business of retail installment sales. Respondent assailed the Act as depriving it of its property without due process of law and denying it the equal protection of the laws contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court granted a permanent injunction, and a direct appeal lies.\n The allegation of the complaint that the matter in controversy exceeds the sum of $3,000 in value, exclusive of interest and costs, was denied by the answer. In support of the general jurisdictional allegation, respondent refers to the facts, as found by the District Court or not questioned by appellants, that the net worth of its business is in excess of $3,000; that it has on hand cars of the combined value of $16,000; that in the five months expiring May 31, 1935, it sold 481 cars, the aggregate retail prices of which amounted to about $164,000; that a substantial majority of its sales-about 65 per cent. during the first five months of 1935-consisted of installment or time sales; that based upon orders and criteria commonly employed to forecast future sales, it expected to sell approximately 330 cars in June and July of 1935, and 495 cars during the second six months of that year. Respondent also refers to allegations of its complaint that its present and future earnings and the conduct of its business would be rendered uncertain by reason of the risk involved in making future commitments for the purchase of automobiles and the inability to obtain future commitments for the resale of such automobiles and for \n\n[298 U.S. 190, 192]\n\u00a0\n those on hand, and for the sale of retail installment contracts covering the automobiles on hand, as well as cars which might be ordered, to the General Motors Acceptance Corporation or any other finance company. These allegations were put in issue.\n The District Court made findings with respect to the character and extent of respondent's business, but the record contains no finding or evidence showing the amount of the loss, if any, which would be caused by the regulations assailed.\n Respondent contends that the burden of proving the lack of jurisdiction rested upon those challenging the jurisdiction. We have considered and overruled the similar contention in our opinion in McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, supra. In this aspect we find no substantial difference between the two cases.\n The decree of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMECHANICS UNIVERSAL JOINT CO. v.

The answer denied that the bank was then insolvant; that it was known by its officers and directors to be so; that they contemplated the imminent necessity of its closing; and that the payment was made with a view to a preference. On these issues much evidence was introduced. The District Court, making detailed findings of fact, found on all those issues for the plaintiff, and entered a decree accordingly. The Court of Appeals, accepting the findings made by the trial court, affirmed the decree. 80 F.(2d) 147.

General Motors Corporation, \n299 \nU.S. 3\n, 57 S.Ct. 1, decided October 26, 1936\n\n\n On Friday, June 12, the balance in the company's account in the Manufacturers Bank was $65,224.30. On that day, the check for $42,761.12 was drawn, payable to the Third National Bank of Rockford, where it also had a general checking account, and was sent for deposit in that account. On Saturday, the 13th, the check was paid through the clearing house. Never before had the company transferred money from its checking account in the \n\n[299 U.S. 51, 54]\n\u00a0\n Manufacturers Bank to its general checking account in the Third National. On June 12 and 13, 1931, the Manufacturers Bank conducted its business as usual. It accepted deposits; honored all checks, whether presented through the clearing house or otherwise; and paid all demands upon it. It had not committed any 'act of insolvency.' But it was, in fact, insolvent; and was known by its officers to be so. On June 13, it closed its doors at the conclusion of regular banking hours and it did not thereafter open them. On June 16, the Comptroller of the Currency certified that the bank was insolvent and appointed a receiver.\n The check was executed by Ekstrom, the president and manager of the company, who then was, and for two years had been, a director of the Manufacturers Bank. He knew its precarious condition. He knew that for some time prior to June 12 the bank had been on the special list of the Comptroller of the Currency for frequent examination and report. As early as January 8, 1931, the Comptroller had called the bank's attention to its unsatisfactory condition. In a letter dated May 28, 1931, he pointed out 'its present dangerous situation' and 'potential losses that threaten its solvency.' Ekstrom, as director, had examined the reports of the bank's condition made by the National Bank Examiner; had read the letters from the Comptroller; and had been present at an informal meeting of the board, held upon request of the Examiner, on June 12 between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning. The Examiner attended the meeting; discussed the bank's condition; advised its officers and the directors that there would be a run on the Rockford banks on the following Monday; and told them 'that the cash position of the Manufacturers Bank was so low that it could not stand a run of one business day.' The directors authorized him 'to talk over the affairs of the Manufacturers Bank with a view to having said bank \n\n[299 U.S. 51, 55]\n\u00a0\n taken over by some other bank in Rockford'; and appointed a committee to that end. Ekstrom participated in that action. Shortly after leaving the meeting, he signed the check and caused it to be sent by mail for collection.\n First. The company contends that, even if Ekstrom's purpose was to obtain for his company a preference over other creditors, the withdrawal of the deposit was not unlawful. The argument is (a) that in drawing the check, and thus causing its payment, Ekstrom acted not as director of the bank but as president of the company; (b) that he was neither an employee of the bank, nor specifically authorized as a director to make payment of the check; (c) that this payment was but one with many others which the bank made on the days involved, in the ordinary course of business, and not in contemplation of the commission of an act of insolvency; (d) that the payment cannot be held to have been made by the bank in contemplation of insolvency 'with a view to prefer one creditor to another,' since this check was paid, like others, in the usual course, without intention on the part of the bank's managing officers to prefer the company; (e) that the wrongful action, if any, was that of Ekstrom in using for his company's benefit knowledge obtained in confidence as director of the bank; but (f) that such breach of duty of a director does not entitle the receiver to recover, because the liability sought to be enforced is wholly statutory, and the statute does not provide that payments to a depositor on withdrawal made pursuant to confidential information obtained as bank director shall be void. The contention is unsound.\n One of the objects of the national bank system is to secure, in the event of insolvency, a just and equal distribution of the assets of national banks among unsecured creditors, and to prevent such banks from creating preference in contemplation of their failure. Compare First Na- \n\n[299 U.S. 51, 56]\n\u00a0\n tional Bank v. Colby, 21 Wall. 609, 613, 614; Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275, 284\n, 290 S., 16 S.Ct. 502. To that end R.S.  5242, 12 U.S.C.  91, (12 U.S.C.A.  91), prohibits preferential payments. That prohibition is not directed solely to managing officers. The duty not so to defeat the just and equal distribution of the assets commanded by the act rests upon all who obtain such knowledge by reason of their connection with the bank-upon directors and employees as well as upon the executive officers. \n3\n By R.S.  5147, as amended, 12 U.S.C .  73 (12 U.S.C.A.  73), each director is required to take an oath that he 'will not knowingly violate or willingly permit to be violated any of the provisions of this title.' Finn v. Brown, \n142 \nU.S. 56, 68\n, 12 S.Ct. 136. Ekstrom violated his oath and the duty under R.S.  5242 (12 U.S.C.A.  91), which it imposed, when he used knowledge of the bank's perilous condition, gained in his position of trust, to cause the withdrawal of funds by his company, with a view to assuring it a preference over other depositors who lacked that knowledge.\n We have no occasion to decide whether a stranger would be liable as for a preference, if, without suggestion from any officer or employee of the bank, he withdrew his deposit because of rumor or suspicion of insolvency. It is true that ordinarily a payment made by a bank to a depositor in the usual course of business is not recoverable, even though the bank was then clearly insolvent. Compare McDonald v. Chemical National Bank, \n174 \nU.S. 610\n, 19 S.Ct. 787. But the payment here in question was not made in the usual course of business; and the company was not a stranger. Its president and manager was a director of the bank; as such acquired in confidence knowledge \n\n[299 U.S. 51, 57]\n\u00a0\n of its perilous condition; and, in violation of his statutory duty as director, used that knowledge for the purpose of preferring his company. If the deposit withdrawn had been in Ekstrom's own name, he would, obviously, have been obliged to return it. The company is in no better position. Compare McCaskill Co. v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 504\n, 30 S.Ct. 386; Curtis, Collins & Holbrook Co. v. United States, \n262 \nU.S. 215\n, 43 S.Ct. 570. As it is liable under the statute, we have no occasion to decide whether it would be liable also on general principles of law or equity. Compare Yates v. Jones National Bank, \n206 \nU.S. 158, 178\n, 27 S.Ct. 638; Bowerman v. Hamner, \n250 \nU.S. 504, 510\n, 39 S.Ct. 549.\n Second. Ekstrom was joined with the company as codefendant and was held liable with it, jointly and severally. For such personal liability there was ample basis. Knowing that the bank was in imminent danger of closing, it was Ekstrom's duty as director to conserve the assets for the benefit of all unsecured creditors-or specifically not to use that knowledge confidentially obtained to prefer his company. He depleted the assets by causing the preference to be given; and thus violated the duty under R.S.  5242 (12 U.S.C.A.  91), which he had sworn to perform. Compare Bowerman v. Hamner, \n250 \nU.S. 504\n, 39 S.Ct. 549.4\n Third. The company sought by counter-claim to recover $20,034.12, the balance remaining after deducting from the aggregate of its deposits between May 6, 1931, and June 13, 1931, the checks drawn and paid in that period including the check for $42,761.12 here in question. The claim is that when these deposits were made the bank was insolvent; that the deposits had been obtained fraudulently by impliedly representing (through keeping the bank open) that it was solvent; and that hence, the title to so much of them as came into the hands of the receiver \n\n[299 U.S. 51, 58]\n\u00a0\n remained in the company, and could be followed as a trust fund. The Circuit Court of Appeals stated that it affirmed the action of the trial court dismissing the counterclaim on the ground that no fraud had been practiced by the bank on the company and that 'it was not an innocent depositor by reason of the acts of its president.' The receiver gives additional reasons in support of that action. We have no occasion to enter far into the inquiry. Throughout the litigation the company has insisted that the bank was still solvent on June 12 when the check in question was drawn, and on June 13 when it was paid. As to those dates the findings are to the contrary. But there is no finding that prior to June 12 the bank was insolvent, or that prior to the discussion at the informal directors' meeting its executive officers or directors believed it to be so. The evidence is clearly consistent with the conclusion that between May 6 and June 7 it was believed to be solvent. The counterclaim was properly dismissed. Compare St. Louis & San Francisco Railway Co. v. Johnston, \n133 \nU.S. 566, 576\n, 10 S.Ct. 390; Easton v. Iowa, \n188 \nU.S. 220, 232\n, 23 S.Ct. 288.\n Fourth. The decree entered was for $25,216.45. That sum was arrived at by deducting from the $42,761.12 withdrawn, the aggregate amount of the dividends which would have been paid by the receiver to the company thereon if that sum had remained on deposit, adding interest at 5 per cent. to both the debit and the credits. The receiver contends that the defendants were wrongly credited with interest on the dividends, because no dividend was payable until full restitution with interest had been made of the illegal preference; and then only after proof of the company's claim. We have no occasion to consider this alleged error in the decree as the receiver did not file a cross-petition for certiorari. Compare Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific States Paper Trade Association, \n\n[299 U.S. 51, 59]\n\u00a0\n \n273 \nU.S. 52, 66\n, 47 S.Ct. 255, 259; Charles Warner Co. v.

C.A.8th), in which certiorari was granted, \n296 \nU.S. 557\n, 56 S.Ct. 104, on the same day, to resolve questions as to the mode of appeal from certain orders entered by a District Court in the course of a reorganization proceeding under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 48 Stat. 912, 11 U.S.C. 207, 11 U.S.C.A.  207. The writ in St. Louis Can Co. v. General American Life Insurance Co. was later dismissed by this Court on stipulation of the parties, \n296 \nU.S. 660\n, 56 S.Ct. 305.\n On February 4, 1935, an involuntary petition was filed in the District Court for Northern Illinois for reorganization of a corporate debtor. The debtor filed an answer admitting the essential allegations of the petition, and the District Court found that the petition was filed in good faith, and ordered that it stand approved, and that creditors be restrained from asserting claims against the property of the debtor. After this order was entered, the petitioner here filed a petition in the reorganization proceeding setting up that she owned some of the mortgage bonds to which the property of the debtor was subject; that subsequent to the petition for reorganization, but before it was approved, she had brought suit in the state courts against the debtor and others for an accounting, charging fraud in the issue and sale of the bonds and a fraudulent scheme to bring about a reorganization of the debtor to the detriment of the bondholders and to the advantage of the defendants in the suit. She prayed that the petition for reorganization be \n\n[297 U.S. 160, 162]\n\u00a0\n dismissed for want of good faith and of jurisdiction in the District Court, and that the injunction be dissolved. The District Court entered an order March 20, 1935, denying the petition. From this order it allowed an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which dismissed the appeal without opinion. 77 F.(2d) 1004. The correctness of this ruling is presented in No. 375.\n Meanwhile, the District Court proceeded with hearings, in which petitioner took no part, on a proposed plan of reorganization. The plan, after certain modifications, was ultimately approved by 94 per cent. of the bondholders of one class and 95 per cent. of another, and, with further changes directed by the court, was confirmed by order entered May 20, 1935. The Court of Appeals dismissed without opinion petitioner's appeal from this order, allowed by the District Court. 78 F.(2d) 1018. And it denied petitioner's application for leave to appeal from the same order, on the ground that petitioner, who alone sought leave to appeal, had not objected to the plan in the bankruptcy court, and so was not in a position to challenge the plan on her own behalf or on that of bondholders who had objected. The correctness of these rulings of the Court of Appeals is presented in No. 376.\n\n 1. \nThe question in No. 375 is whether the order of the District Court denying the application to dismiss the proceeding brought under section 77B and to dissolve the injunction generally restraining creditors, is, for purposes of appeal, the equivalent of 'a judgment adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant a bankrupt,' which by section 25a of the Bankruptcy Act, 44 Stat. 665; 48 Stat. 926, 11 U.S.C.  48(a), 11 U.S.C.A .  48(a), is appealable as of right to the Court of Appeals.\n When section 77B introduced into the Bankruptcy Act the proceeding for reorganization of a corporation, it was provided that the procedure to be followed in case reorganization were ordered should, so far as practicable, fol- \n\n[297 U.S. 160, 163]\n\u00a0\n low that already established by the Bankruptcy Act for liquidation proceedings. Section 77B(k)1, 11 U.S.C.A.  207(k), directs that the other sections of the Bankruptcy Act hall apply to proceedings under section 77B, unless inconsistent with it, and that 'the date of the order approving the petition or answer under this section shall be taken to be the date of adjudication, and such order shall have the same consequences and effect as an order of adjudication.'\n The appeal provisions of sections 24 and 252 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended 11 U.S.C.A.  47, 48, are thus made applicable to orders entered in the course of a reorganization proceeding, and an order approving or disapproving a petition for reorganization is made the equivalent, at least for purposes of an appeal under section 25a, of a judgment adjudging or refusing to \n\n[297 U.S. 160, 164]\n\u00a0\n adjudge the defendant a bankrupt. By section 24a and section 24b appeals in 'proceedings' in bankruptcy, as distinguished from appeals in 'controversies arising in bankruptcy,' may be taken only on leave granted in the discretion of the appellate court, except that in the cases enumerated in section 25a, including, in clause (1), 'a judgment adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant a bankrupt,' an appeal may be taken as of right.\n The petitioner appealed not from the order approving the reorganization, but from that denying her application to dismiss the reorganization proceedings. It is not contended that this order is one in a controversy arising in bankruptcy, appealable as of right under section 24a. See Taylor v. Voss, \n271 \nU.S. 176, 181\n, 46 S.Ct. 461; Harrison v. Chamberlin, \n271 \nU.S. 191\n, 46 S.Ct. 467; Hewit v. Berlin Machine Works, \n194 \nU.S. 296, 299\n, 300 S., 24 S.Ct. 690. It is urged that it is the equivalent of an order approving a petition in a reorganization proceeding, which section 77B(k) assimilate to an order of adjudication, appealable as of right. But an order refusing to set aside an adjudication of bankruptcy is not within section 25a, cl. (1). This Court has held that an appeal can be taken from such an order only on leave of the appellate court, under section 24b. Valley v. Northern Fire & Marine Insurance Co., \n254 \nU.S. 348\n, 41 S.Ct. 116. The present appeal from the order refusing to dismiss the reorganization \n\n[297 U.S. 160, 165]\n\u00a0\n proceedings does not stand on any different footing, and was rightly dismissed because taken without leave of the appellate court. Humphry v. Bankers Mortgage Co. (C.C.A.) 79 F.(2d) 345; Vitagraph, Inc., v. St. Louis Properties Corporation (C.C.A.) 77 F.(2d) 590; St. Louis Can Co. v. General American Life Insurance Co., supra; Credit Alliance Corporation v. Atlantic Pacific & Gulf Refining Co. (C.C.A.) 77 F.(2d) 595; and see Wilkerson v. Cooch (C.C.A.) 78 F. (2d) 311.\n That part of petitioner's application to the District Court which asked that the injunction restraining creditors be set aside does not present a 'controversy arising in bankruptcy' as distinguished from a 'proceeding' in bankruptcy. The relief from the restraining order which petitioner sought was but incidental to her assault on the order approving the petition, and raised no issue capable of litigation independently of the proceeding in the bankruptcy court. It related only to the due administration of the pending proceeding and so was a 'proceeding' in bankruptcy, in which the allowance of an appeal is discretionary. See Taylor v. Voss, supra; Harrison v. Chamberlin, supra.\n\n 2. \nIn No. 376 petitioner contends that the order of the District Court approving the plan of reorganization corresponds to an order confirming or rejecting a composition with creditors, and that the latter, as was held in United States ex rel. Adler v. Hammond (C.C.A.) 104 F. 862, is appealable as of right under section 25 as equivalent to an order 'granting or denying a discharge.' But we think it plain that an order confirming a plan of reorganization under section 77B is not the equivalent of a judgment granting or denying a discharge, for, unlike confirmation of a composition, see section 14c, 30 Stat. 550, 11 U.S.C.  32(c), 11 U.S.C.A.  32(c), it does not operate as a discharge. The release of the debtor in a reorganization proceeding is contingent upon the performance of its part of the reorganization plan. Section 77B(h), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(h), commands the debtor and others to execute \n\n[297 U.S. 160, 166]\n\u00a0\n the plan of reorganization, when confirmed, under the direction of the court, authorizes the court to make appropriate orders to that end, and provides that 'upon the termination of the proceedings a final decree shall be entered,' which 'shall discharge the debtor from its debts and liabilities.' Discharge is effected not by confirmation of the plan but by the final decree.\n Confirmation of a plan of reorganization is but a step in the administration of the debtor's estate, and, for reasons already stated, is an order in a proceeding in bankruptcy rather than a controversy arising in bankruptcy proceedings, and appeal lies only in the discretion of the appellate court. See Campbell v. Alleghany Corporation (C.C.A.) 75 F.(2d) 947, 955.\n\n 3. \nIn the exercise of the discretion conferred upon it by section 24b, the court below denied the application for leave to appeal from the order of the District Court confirming the plan of reorganization. Petitioner, who alone asked leave to appeal, made no objection to the plan. Her criticisms of the plan are not of a character to invite the exercise of the discretion of the court to examine them for the first time on appeal.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 77B, subsec.

The company had refused to transport the bales because of the lack of the bale tags required by the Cotton Control Act of April 21, 1934 (sections 10, 14, 48 Stat. 598, 603, 604 (7 U.S.C.A.  710, 714)). Moor contended that the statute was void, as an attempt to regulate the production of cotton contrary to the provisions of the Fifth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States. On final hearing, the District Court did not rule upon the constitutional question, but denied the injunction and dismissed the complaint upon the ground that it had not been shown that the plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury for which he had no adequate remedy at law. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree ( 75 F.(2d) 386), and certiorari was granted.\n The complaint alleged that the plaintiff was the owner of more than 3, 500 acres of land in El Paso county, Tex.; that the encumbrances and the taxes and charges assessed for water were such as to require that he raise and sell annually 2,000 bales of cotton for at least 10 cents a pound net, or lose his land through foreclosure proceedings; that his cotton would have no value unless it could be transported to cotton markets; that the Cotton Control Act (section 4 (7 U.S.C.A.  701)) imposed a tax of 50 per centum of the average central market price per pound of lint cotton, and in no event less than 5 cents per pound; that having ginned about 1,000 bales of cotton, and being under the financial necessity of selling them, which was impossible under the statute unless he procured bale tags showing that the cotton was exempt or the tax had been paid, he had sought, under duress, and had obtained tax exemption certificates for 855 1\/2 bales, the entire amount to which he was entitled; that he would raise and gin a total of about 2,500 bales, each of the average weight of 500 pounds, \n\n[297 U.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n during the year 1934, and had already ginned 1,833 bales; that he had tendered, without the required tags, 10 bales to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company for shipment to New York, and 10 bales to the defendant for shipment to New Orleans, but shipment had been refused solely by reason of the absence of the tags; that the average central market price of lint cotton was about 12 cents per pound, and, if transported, his cotton would be worth about $60 a bale and the tax would be about $30 a bale; that if he was not permitted to move his cotton in interstate commerce he would suffer damage to the extent at least of $60,000, but that it would be impossible to determine the amount of damage accurately; that he had no adequate remedy at law and would be required to file a large number of suits based upon the refusal of the railroad companie to accept shipments. The complaint was not verified.\n On October 25, 1934, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, invoking the provisions of the act as a valid enactment, and on the same day the defendant answered to the same effect.\n The case was tried on October 30 and November 5, 1934. Plaintiff made two 'trial amendments' which somewhat amplified the allegations of his complaint. Defendant admitted the truth of substantially all the allegations, except those relating to duress in connection with plaintiff's application for exemption certificates and as to the amount of his allotment, those as to future shipments, and those containing legal conclusions as to the invalidity of the act and the tax which it imposed.\n The trial court received evidence. Plaintiff did not appear as a witness. The manager of his farm testified generally as to its cotton production, the market for cotton, and plaintiff's inability to sell or move his cotton without the bale tags; that the average central market price of cotton was about 12 cents a pound, or $60 a bale of 500 pounds; that plaintiff had borrowed $50,000 to finish harvesting his cotton, mortgaging his 855 bales as security \n\n[297 U.S. 101, 105]\n\u00a0\n for that loan which had been liquidated; and that plaintiff's financial condition was such that it was necessary for him to realize on his cotton. Another witness testified as to general market conditions. No testimony was offered for the defendant.\n The allegations of the complaint with respect to plaintiff's financial necessities, as a ground for equitable intervention, were of the most general character, and the evidence in that relation was general and meager. There were general statements as to encumbrances and expenses, without any showing of details. Apparently, plaintiff had disposed of the 855 exempt bales, and there was no showing that he could not have obtained the money necessary to move the remaining bales. The trial court concluded that plaintiff had failed to make a case for equitable relief and should be left to his legal remedy.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming the decree, rested its decision upon the established principle that a mandatory injunction is not granted as a matter of right, but is granted or refused in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion. Morrison v. Work, \n266 \nU.S. 481, 490\n, 45 S.Ct. 149.\n In this view of the record, and of the discretion which the trial court was entitled to exercise, the writ of certiorari was improvidently granted, and it is dismissed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOREHEAD v.

Relator was indicted in the county court of Kings county and sent to jail to await trial upon the charge that as manager of a laundry he failed to obey the mandatory order of the state industrial commissioner prescribing minimum wages for women employees. \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 603]\n\u00a0\n The relator's petition for the writ avers that the statute, chapter 584 of the Laws of 1933 adding article 19 to the Labor Law N.Y. (Consol. Law, c. 31), under which the commissioner made the order, in so far as it purports to authorize him to fix women's wages, is repugnant to the due process clause, article 1,  6, of the Constitution of the State and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The application for the writ is grounded upon the claim that the state statute is substantially identical with the minimum wage law enacted by Congress for the District of Columbia, 40 Stat. 960, which in 1923 was condemned by this court as repugnant to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, 43 S. Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238\n\n\n The warden's return, without disclosing the commissioner's order, the prescribed wages, the findings essential to his jurisdiction to establish them, things done in pursuance of the act, or the allegations of the indictment, merely shows that under an order of the county court he was detaining relator for trial. The case was submitted on petition and return. The court dismissed the writ. People ex rel. Tipaldo v. Morehead, 156 Misc. 522, 282 N.Y.S. 576. Relator took the case to the Court of Appeals. It held the act repugnant to the due process clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions. 270 N.Y. 233, 200 N.E. 799. The remittitur directed that the order appealed from be reversed, the writ sustained, and the prisoner discharged; it certified that the federal constitutional question was presented and necessarily passed on. The supreme court entered judgment as directed. We granted a writ of certiorari. Morehead v. People of State of New York ex rel. Tipaldo, \n297 \nU.S. 702\n, 56 S.Ct. 670.\n The act extends to women and minors in any 'occupation' which 'shall mean an industry, trade or business or branch thereof or class of work therein in which women or minors are gainfully employed, but shall not include domestic service in the home of the employer or labor \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 604]\n\u00a0\n on a farm.' Section 551(6). It is not an emergency law. It does not regulate hours or any conditions affecting safety or protection of employees. It relates only to wages of adult women and minors. As the record is barren of details in respect of investigation, findings, amounts being paid women workers in laundries or elsewhere prior to the order, or of things done to ascertain the minimum prescribed, we must take it as granted that, if the state is permitted as against emp oyers and their women employees to establish and enforce minimum wages, that power has been validly exerted. It is to be assumed that the rates have been fairly made in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the act and in full compliance with the defined standards. If, consistently with the due process clause, the state may not enter upon regulation of the sort undertaken by the challenged enactment, then plainly it cannot by diligence to insure the establishment of just minima create power to enter that field. Cf. St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 80 L.Ed. --; Baltimore & Ohio R.R. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 349\n, 56 S.Ct. 797, 80 L.Ed. --.\n The Adkins Case, unless distinguishable, requires affirmance of the judgment below. The petition for the writ sought review upon the ground that this case is distinguishable from that one. No application has been made for reconsideration of the constitutional question there decided. \n1\n The validity of the principles upon which that decision rests is not challenged. This court confines itself to the ground upon which the writ was \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 605]\n\u00a0\n asked or granted. Alice State Bank v. Houston Pasture Co., \n247 \nU.S. 240, 242\n, 38 S.Ct. 496; Clark v. Williard, \n294 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 55 S.Ct. 356, 98 A.L.R. 347. Here the review granted was no broader than that sought by the petitioner. Johnson v. Manhattan Ry. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 479, 494\n, 53 S.Ct. 721. He is not entitled and does not ask to be heard upon the question whether the Adkins Case should be overruled. He maintains that it may be distinguished on the ground that the statutes are vitally dissimilar.\n The District of Columbia Act provided for a board to ascertain and declare 'standards of minimum wages' for women in any occupation and what wages were 'inadequate to supply the necessary cost of living to any such women workers to maintain them in good health and to protect their morals.' Section 9. Violations were punishable by fine and imprisonment. Section 18. The declared purposes were to protect women from conditions detrimental to their health and morals, resulting from wages inadequate to maintain decent standards of living. Section 23.\n The New York act declares it to be against public policy for any employer to employ any woman at an oppressive and unreasonable wage ( section 552) defined as one which is 'both less than the fair and reasonable value of the services rendered and less than sufficient to meet the minimum cost of living necessary for health.' Section 551(7). 'A fair wage' is one 'fairly and reasonably commensurate with the value of the service or class of service rendered.' Section 551(8). If the commissioner is of opinion that any substantial number of women in any occupation are receiving oppressive and unreasonable wages he shall appoint a wage board to report upon the establishment of minimum fair wage rates. Section 554. After investigation, the board shall submit a report including its recommendations as to minimum fair wage standards. Section 555.\n And for administrative guidance, the act declares: 'In establishing a minimum fair wage for any service or class \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 606]\n\u00a0\n of service under this article the commissioner and the wages board without being bound by any technical rules of evidence or procedure (1) may take into account all relevant circumstances affecting the value of the service or class of service rendered, and (2) may be guided by like considerations as would guide a court in a suit for the reasonable value of services rendere where services are rendered at the request of an employer without contract as to the amount of the wage to be paid, and (3) may consider the wages paid in the state for work of like or comparable character by employers who voluntarily maintain minimum fair wage standards.' Section 551(8).\n If the commissioner accepts the report, he shall publish it and a public hearing must be held. Section 556. If after the hearing he approves the report, he 'shall make a directory order which shall define minimum fair wage rates.' Section 557. Upon hearing and finding of disobedience the commissioner may publish the name of an employer as having failed to observe the directory order. Section 559. If, after a directory order has been in effect for nine months, the commissioner is of opinion that persistent nonobservance is a threat to the maintenance of the prescribed standards, he may after hearing make the order mandatory. Section 560. Violation of a mandatory order is a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment or both. Section 565(2).\n Thus it appears: The minimum wage provided for in the District act was one not less than adequate 'to supply the necessary cost of living to any such women workers to maintain them in good health and to protect their morals.' Section 9. The New York act defines an oppressive and unreasonable wage as containing two elements. The one first mentioned is: 'less than the fair and reasonable value of the services rendered.' The other is: 'less than sufficient to meet the minimum cost of living necessary for health.' Section 551(7). The basis last mentioned is not to be distin- \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 607]\n\u00a0\n guished from the living wage defined in the District act. The exertion of the granted power to prescribe minimum wages is by the state act conditioned upon a finding by the commissioner or other administrative agency that a substantial number of women in any occupation are receiving wages that are oppressive and unreasonable, i.e., less than value of the service and less than a living wage. That finding is essential to jurisdiction of the commissioner. In the state court there was controversy between the parties as to whether the 'minimum fair wage rates' are required to be established solely upon value of service or upon that value and the living wage. Against the contention of the attorney general, the Court of Appeals held that the minimum wage must be based on both elements.\n Speaking through its chief judge, that court said (270 N.Y. 233, 200 N.E. 799, 800): 'We find no material difference between the act of Congress and this act of the New York State Legislature. The act of Congress, it is said, was to protect women from conditions resulting from wages which were inadequate to maintain decent standards of living.' The opinion then quotes from the brief of the attorney general: \"The purpose of the statute in the Adkins Case was to guarantee a wage based solely upon the necessities of the workers. The statute did not provide for the wages to have any relationship to earning power; was applicable to all vocations and not to the character of the work. ... As contrasted with this statute, the New York Minimum Wage Law provides a definite standard for wages paid. It provides that the worker is to be paid at least the value of the services rendered.\" The opinion continues: 'This is a difference in phraseology and not in principle. The New York act, as above stated, prohibits an oppressive and unreasonable wage, which means both less than the fair and reasonable value of the services rendered and \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 608]\n\u00a0\n less than sufficient to meet the minimum cost of living necessary for health. The act of Congress had one standard, the living wage; this state act has added another, reasonable value. The minimum wage must include both. What was vague before has not been made any clearer. One of the elements, therefore, in fixing the fair wage is the very matter which was the basis of the congressional act. Forcing the payment of wages at a reasonable value does not make inappli able the principle and ruling of the Adkins Case. The distinctions between this case and the Adkins Case are difference in details, methods, and time; the exercise of legislative power to fix wages in any employment is the same.'\n The petitioner does not suggest and reasonably it cannot be thought that, so far as concerns repugnancy to the due process clause, there is any difference between the minimum wage law for the District of Columbia and the clause of the New York act, 'less than sufficient to meet the minimum cost of living necessary for health.' Petitioner does not claim that element was validated by including with it the other ingredient, 'less than the fair and reasonable value of the services rendered.'\n His brief repeats the state court's declaration: \"The act of Congress had one standard, the living wage; this State act has added another, reasonable value. The minimum wage must include both. What was vague before has not been made any clearer. One of the elements, therefore, in fixing the fair wage is the very matter which was the basis of the congressional act.\" Then he says: 'The italicized lines carry the Court's misconception of the statute. It is a basic misconception. From it flows the erroneous conclusion of the Court of Appeals that there exists no material difference between the two statutes .... Those two factors do not enter into the determination of the minimum 'fair wage' as in the statute defined, nor as determined in this case. The only basis for \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 609]\n\u00a0\n evaluating and arriving at the 'fair minimum wage' is the fair value of the services rendered.'\n There is no blinking the fact that the state court construed the prescribed standard to include cost of living or that petitioner here refuses to accept that construction. Petitioner's contention that the Court of Appeals misconstrued the act cannot be entertained. This court is without power to put a different construction upon the state enactment from that adopted by the highest court of the state. We are not at liberty to consider petitioner's argument based on the construction repudiated by that court. The meaning of the statute as fixed by its decision must be accepted here as if the meaning had been specifically expressed in the enactment. Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias v. Meyer, \n265 \nU.S. 30, 32\n, 44 S.Ct. 432. Exclusive authority to enact carries with it final authority to say what the measure means. Jones v. Prairie Oil & Gas Co., \n273 \nU.S. 195, 200\n, 47 S.Ct. 338. The standard of 'minimum fair wage rates' for women workers to be prescribed must be considered as if both elements-value of service and living wage-were embodied in the statutory definition itself. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216, 220\n, 34 S.Ct. 853. As our construction of an act of Congress must be deemed by state courts to be the law of the United States, so this New York Act as construed by her court of last resort, must here be taken to express the intention and purpose of her lawmakers. Green v. Lessee of Neal, 6 Pet. 291, 295-298.\n The state court rightly held that the Adkins Case controls this one and requires that relator be discharged upon the ground that the legislation under which he was indicted and imprisoned is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The general statement in the New York Act of the fields of labor it includes, taken in connection with the work not covered, indicates legislative intention to reach \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 610]\n\u00a0\n nearly all private employers of women. The act does not extend to men. It does extend to boys and girls under the age of 21 years but there is here involved no question as to its validity in respect of wages to be prescribed for them. Relator's petition for the writ shows that the charge against him is that as manager of a laundry he 'disobeyed a mandatory order prescribing certain minimum wages for certain adult women employees of the said laundry.' The rights of no other cl  of workers are here involved.\n Upon the face of the act the question arises whether the state may impose upon the employers state-made minimum wage rates for all competent experienced women workers whom they may have in their service. That question involves another one. It is: Whether the state has power similarly to subject to state-made wages all adult women employed in trade, industry or business, other than house and farm work. These were the questions decided in the Adkins Case. So far at least as concerns the validity of the enactment under consideration, the restraint imposed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment upon legislative power of the state is the same as that imposed by the corresponding provision of the Fifth Amendment upon the legislative power of the United States.\n This court's opinion shows (\n261 U.S. 525\n, at pages 545, 546, 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238): The right to make contracts about one's affairs is a part of the liberty protected by the due process clause. Within this liberty are provisions of contracts between employer and employee fixing the wages to be paid. In making contracts of employment, generally speaking, the parties have equal right to obtain from each other the best terms they can by private bargaining. Legislative abridgement of that freedom can only be justified by the existence of exceptional circumstances. Freedom of contract is the \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 611]\n\u00a0\n general rule and restraint the exception. This court has found not repugnant to the due process clause statutes fixing rates and charges to be exacted by businesses impressed with a public interest, relating to contracts for the performance of public work, prescribing the character, methods and time of payment of wages, fixing hours of labor. Physical differences between men and women must be recognized in proper cases and legislation fixing hours or conditions of work may properly take them into account, but (\n261 U.S. 525\n, at page 553, 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A. L.R. 1238) 'we cannot accept the doctrine that women of mature age, sui juris, require or may be subjected to restrictions upon their liberty of contract which could not lawfully be imposed in the case of men under similar circumstances. To do so would be to ignore all the implications to be drawn from the present day trend of legislation, as well as that of common thought and usage, by which woman is accorded emancipation from the old doctrine that she must be given special protection or be subjected to special restraint in her contractual and civil relationships. ... Enough has been said to show that the authority to fix hours of labor cannot be exercised except in respect of those occupations where work of long continued duration is detrimental to health. This court has been careful in every case where the question has been raised, to place its decision upon this limited authority of the Legislature to regulate hours of labor and to disclaim any purpose to uphold the legislation as fixing wages, thus recognizing an essential difference between the two. It seems plain that these decisions afford no real support for any form of law establishing minimum wages.'\n The decision and the reasoning upon which it rests clearly show that the state is without power by any form of legislation to prohibit, change or nullify contracts between employers and adult women workers as to the amount of wages to be paid. \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 612]\n\u00a0\n Then, the opinion emphasizes objections specifically applicable to the requirement that the minimum wages to be prescribed under the District act shall be adequate 'to supply the necessary cost of living to any such women workers to maintain them in good health and to protect their morals.' Section 9. Some of them were: The price fixed by the board need have no relation to earning powers, hours or place or character of work; it is based wholly on opinion of the board as to what amount will be necessary to comply with the standard; it applies to every occupation without regard to the kind of wor ; the standard is so vague as to be impossible of practical application; the act takes account of the necessities of only the employee; to the extent that the sum fixed exceeds fair value of service rendered, it amounts to a compulsory exaction for the support of a partially indigent person for whose condition there rests upon the employer no peculiar responsibility; the statute exacts from the employer an arbitrary payment for a purpose and upon a basis having no causal connection with his business or the contract or the work the employee engages to do; the declared basis is not the value of the service rendered but the extraneous circumstance that the employee needs to get a prescribed sum of money to insure her subsistence, health and morals. The court said: The ethical right of every worker, man or woman, to have a living wage may be conceded. The fallacy of the proposed method of attaining it is that it assumes that every employer is bound at all events to furnish it. The moral requirement, implicit in every contract of employment, viz., that the amount to be paid and the service to be rendered shall bear to each other some relation of just equivalence, is completely ignored. The necessities of the employee are alone considered and these arise outside of the employment and are as great in one occupation as in another. \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 613]\n\u00a0\n Illustrating particular constitutional difficulties encountered by the enactment then before us, the opinion proceeds (\n261 U.S. 525\n, at page 559, 43 S.Ct. 394, 401, 24 A.L.R. 1238): 'Should a statute undertake to vest in a commission power to determine the quantity of food necessary for individual support, and require the shopkeeper if he sell to the individual at all, to furnish that quantity at not more than a fixed maximum, it would undoubtedly fall before the constitutional test. The fallacy of any argument in support of the validity of such a statute would be quickly exposed. The argument in support of that now being considered is equally fallacious, though the weakness of it may not be so plain. A statute requiring an employer to pay in money, to pay at prescribed and regular intervals, to pay the value of the services rendered, even to pay with fair relation to the extent of the benefit obtained from the service, would be understandable. But a statute which prescribes payment without regard to any of these things, and solely with relation to circumstances apart from the contract of employment, the business affected by it, and the work done under it, is so clearly the product of a naked, arbitrary exercise of power that it cannot be allowed to stand under the Constitution of the United States.'\n Petitioner does not attempt to support the act as construed by the state court. His claim is that it is to be tested here as if it did not include the cost of living and as if value of service was the sole standard. Plainly that position is untenable. If the state has power to single out for regulation the amount of wages to be paid women, the value of their services would be a material consideration. But that fact has no relevancy upon the question whether the state has any such power. And utterly without significance upon the question of power is the suggestion that the New York prescribed standard includes value of service with cost of living whereas the District of Columbia standard was based upon the latter \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 614]\n\u00a0\n alone. As shown above, the dominant issue in the Adkins Case was whether Congress had power to establish minimum wages for adult women workers in the District of Columbia. The opinion directly answers in the negative. The ruling that defects in the prescribed standard stamped that act as arbitrary and invalid was an additional ground of subordinate consequence.\n The dissenting opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Taft (in which Mr. Justice Sanford concurred) assumes (\n261 U.S. 525\n, at page 564, 43 S.Ct. 394, 403, 24 A.L.R. 1238) 'that the conclusion in this ( Adkins) Case rests on the distinction betwee a minimum of wages and a maximum of hours.' That is the only point he discussed; he did not refer to the validity of the standard prescribed by the act. The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes begins (\n261 U.S. 525\n, at page 567, 43 S.Ct. 394, 404, 24 A.L.R. 1238): 'The question in this case is the broad one, Whether Congress can establish minimum rates of wages for women in the District of Columbia with due provision for special circumstances, or whether we must say that Congress had no power to meddle with the matter at all.' And, after assuming that women would not be employed at the wages fixed unless they were earned or unless the employer could pay them, the opinion says (\n261 U.S. 525\n, at page 570, 43 S.Ct. 394, 406, 24 A.L.R. 1238): 'But the ground on which the law is held to fail is fundamental and therefore it is unnecessary to consider matters of detail.' If the decision of the court turned upon the question of the validity of the particular standard, that question could not have been ignored by the justices who were in favor of upholding the act. Clearly they understood-and rightly-that, by the opinion of the court, it was held that Congress was without power to deal with the subject at all.\n To distinguish this from the Adkins Case, petitioner refers to changes in conditions that have come since that decision, cites great increase during recent years in the number of women wage earners and invokes the first section of the act, called 'Factual background.' \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 615]\n\u00a0\n The act is not to meet an emergency; it discloses a permanent policy; the increasing number of women workers suggests that more and more they are getting and holding jobs that otherwise would belong to men. The 'factual background' must be read in the light of the circumstances attending its enactment. The New York legislature passed two minimum wage measures and contemporaneously submitted them to the governor. One was approved; it is the act now before us. The other was vetoed and did not become law. They contained the same definitions of oppressive wage and fair wage and in general provided the same machinery and procedure culminating in fixing minimum wages by directory orders. The one vetoed was for an emergency; it extended to men as well as to women employees; it did not provide for the enforcement of wages by mandatory orders.\n It is significant that their 'factual backgrounds' are much alike. They are indicated in the margin. \n2\n These \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 616]\n\u00a0\n legislative declarations, in form of findings or recitals of fact, serve well to illustrate why any measure that deprives employers and adult women of freedom to agree upon wages, leaving employers and men employees free so to do, is necessarily arbitrary. Much, if not all that in them is said in justification of the regulations that the act imposes in respect of women's wages apply with equal force in support of the same regulation of men's wages. While men are left free to fix their wages by agreement with employers, it would be fanciful to suppose that the regulation of women's wages would be useful to prevent or lessen the evils listed in the first section of the act. Men in need of work are as likely as women to accept the low wages offered by unscrupulous employers. Men in greater number than women support themselves and dependents and because of need will work for whatever wages they can get and that without regard to the value of the service and even though the pay is less than minima prescribed in accordance with this act. It is plain that, under circumstances such as those por- \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 617]\n\u00a0\n trayed in the 'factual background,' prescribing of minimum wages for women alone would unreasonably restrain them in competition with men and tend arbitrarily to deprive them of employment and a fair chance to find work.\n This court, on the authority of the Adkins Case and with the acquiescence of all the justices who dissented from the decision,3 held repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment statutes of Arizona and Arkansas,4 respectively, fixing minimum wages for women.

We have adhered to the principle there applied and cited it as a guide in other cases. Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390, 399\n, 43 S.Ct. 625, 29 A.L. R. 1446; Wolff Packing Co. v.

Industrial Commission (D.C.) 300 F. 991; People v. Successors of Laurnaga & Co., 32 Porto Rico, 766.\n The New York court's decision conforms to ours in the Adkins Case, and the later rulings that we have made on the authority of that case. That decision was deliberately made upon careful consideration of the oral arguments and briefs of the respective parties and also of briefs submitted on behalf of states and others as amici curiae. In the Arizona case the attorney general sought to distinguish the District of Columbia act from the legislation then before us and insisted that the latter was a valid exertion of the police power of the state. Counsel for the California commission submitted a brief amicus curiae in which he elaborately argued that our decision in the Adkins Case was erroneous and ought to be overruled. In the Arkansas case the state officers, appellants there, by painstaking and thorough brief presented arguments in favor of the same contention. But this court, after thoughtful attention to all that was suggested against that decision, adhered to it as sound. And in each case, being clearly of opinion that no discussion was required to show that, having regard to the principles applied in the Adkins Case, the state legislation fixing wages for women was repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we so held and upon the authority of that case affirmed per curiam the decree enjoining its enforcement. It is equally plain that the judgment in the case now before us must also be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES, dissenting.\n I am unable to concur in the opinion in this case. In view of the difference between the statutes involved, I \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 619]\n\u00a0\n cannot agree that the case should be regarded as controlled by Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238. And I can find nothing in the Federal Constitution which denies to the state the power to protect women from being exploited by overreaching employers through the refusal of a fair wage as defined in the New York statute and ascertained in a reasonable manner by competent authority.\n First. Relator in his petition for habeas corpus raises no question as to the fairness of the minimum wage he was required to pay. He does not challenge the regularity of the proceedings by which the amount of that wage was determined. We must assume that none of the safeguards of the statute was ignored and that its provisions for careful and deliberate procedure were followed in all respects. It is important at the outset to note the requirements of that procedure, as they at once dispose of any question of arbitrary procedural action.\n The statute states its objectives. It defines an 'oppressive and unreasonable wage' as one which 'is both less than the fair and reasonable value of the services rendered and less than sufficient to meet the minimum cost of living necessary for health.' (Section 551(7). It defines a 'fair wage' as one 'fairly and reasonably commensurate with the value of the service or class of service rendered.' Section 551 (8). It relates to an industry, trade or business, other than domestic service or labor on a farm. The industrial commissioner is authorized to investigate and ascertain the wages of women and minors. If he is of the opinion that any substantial number of women or minors are receiving 'oppressive and unreasonable' wages, he must appoint a wage board to make report. That board is t be composed of not more than three representatives of employers, an equal number of representatives of employees, and not more than three disinterested persons representing the public. The wage board is fully equipped with \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 620]\n\u00a0\n authority to conduct a comprehensive investigation. It may differentiate and classify employments in any occupation according to the nature of the service rendered. It may recommend minimum fair wage rates varying with localities. It may recommend a suitable scale of rates for learners and apprentices which may be less than those recommended for experienced women or minor workers. The wage board may take into account all relevant circumstances affecting the value of the service or class of service. It may be guided by such considerations as would guide a court in a suit for the reasonable value of services rendered. It may consider the wages paid in the state for work of like or comparable character by employers who voluntarily maintain minimum fair wage standards.\n The commissioner may approve or disapprove the report of the wage board. If the commissioner disapproves, he may resubmit the matter to the same or a new board. In case the report is approved, the commissioner is to make a 'directory order' which defines minimum 'fair wage rates' and is to include appropriate administrative regulations. The latter may embrace regulations governing learners, apprentices, piece rates, or their relation to time rates, overtime or part-time rates, bonuses or special pay for special or extra work, deductions for board, lodging, and other items or services supplied by the employer, and other special conditions. Special licenses, authorizing employment at lower rates, may be issued to a woman or minor whose earning capacity is impaired by age or physical or mental deficiency or injury.\n If the commissioner has reason to believe that an employer is not observing the provisions of the 'directory order,' he may, upon notice, summon the employer to show cause why his name should not be published as having failed to comply with the order. And, after hearing and in case of a finding of nonobservance, the com- \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 621]\n\u00a0\n missioner may cause the name of the employer to be published. After a 'directory minimum fair wage order' has been in effect for nine months, if it appears that there has been persistent nonobservance, notice may be given of the intention to make the order mandatory and of a public hearing at which all persons in favor of, or opposed to, such a mandatory order may be heard. And it is after such hearing that the commissioner may make the previous directory order or any part of it mandatory and publish it accordingly.\n It is disobedience to such a mandatory order which is punished by fine or by imprisonmemt. It is the violation of such an order, made after the inquiries, report, the tentative order, and the hearings which the statute enjoins, that is the basis of the prosecution in the case at bar.\n Second. In reaching its conclusion, the state court construed the opinion in the Adkins Case and deemed that ruling applicable here. That, however, is a construction of the decision of this Court. That construction is not binding upon us.\n When the opinion of the state court is examined in order to ascertain what construction was placed upon the statute, we find little more than a recital of its provisions. The state court says (270 N.Y. 233, 200 N.E. 799, 800): 'The New York act, as avove stated, prohibits an oppressive and unreasonable wage, which means both less than the fair and reasonable value of the services rendered and less than sufficient to meet the minimum cost of living necessary for health.' This is a repetition of the words of the statute in subdivision 7 of section 551 defining an 'oppressive and unreasonable wage.' The court adds: 'The act of Congress ( in the Adkins Case) had one standard, the living wage; this state act has added another, reasonable value. The minimum wage must include both. What was vague before has not been made any clearer. One of the elements, \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 622]\n\u00a0\n therefore, in fixing the fair wage is the very matter which was the basis of the congressional act.' But the court expressly recognizes that a wage is not denounced by the New York act as 'oppressive and unreasonable' unless it is less than the fair and reasonable value of the services rendered. The statute also provides in explicit terms that the 'fair wage' which is to be prescribed is one that is 'fairly and reasonably commensurate with the value of the service or class of service rendered.' Section 551(8). I find nothing in the opinion of the state court which can be taken to mean that this definite provision of the statute is not obligatory upon the authorities fixing a fair wage. Certainly, the court has not said so, and I think that we must assume that the standard thus described is set up by the New York act. And there is no suggestion that the 'fair wage' as prescribed in the instant case was not commensurate with the reasonable value of the service rendered by the employees.\n When the opinion of the state court goes beyond the statement of the provisions of the act, and says that the setting up of such a standard does not create a material distinction when compared with the act of Congress in the Adkins Case, the state court is not construing the state statute. It is passing upon the effect of the difference beween the two acts from the standpoint of the Federal Constitution. It is putting aside an admitted difference as not controlling. It is holding, as the state court says, that, 'Forcing the payment of wages at a reasonable value does not make inapplicable the principle and ruling of the Adkins Case.'\n That, it seems to me, is clearly a federal and not a state question, and I pass to its consideration.\n Third. The constitutional validity of a minimum wage statute like the New York act has not heretofore been passed upon by this Court. As I have said, the required correspondence of the prescribed 'fair wage' to \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 623]\n\u00a0\n the reasonable value of the service which the employee performs stands out as an essential feature of the statutory plan. The statute for the District of Columbia which was before us in the Adkins Case did not have that feature. That statute provided for a minimum wage adequate 'to supply the necessary cost of living to women workers' and 'to maintain them in health and to protect their morals.' Section 11, 40 Stat. 963. The standard thus set up did not take account of the reasonable value of the service rendered. As this Court said (\n261 \nU.S. 525\n, 43 S.Ct. 394, 401, 24 A.L.R. 1238), it compelled the employer 'to pay at least the sum fixed in any event, because the employee needs it, but requires no service of equivalent value from the employee.' In the cases of Murphy v. Sardell, \n269 \nU.S. 530\n, 46 S.Ct. 22, and Donham v. West- Nelson Company, \n273 \nU.S. 657\n, 47 S.Ct. 343, the statutes of Arizona and Arkansas, respectively, were of a similar character, and both these cases were decided upon the authority of the Adkins Case. New York and other states have been careful to adopt a different and improved standard, in order to meet the objection aimed at the earlier statutes, by requiring a fair equivalence of wage and service.\n That the difference is a material one, I think is shown by the opinion in the Adkins Case. That opinion contained a broad discussion of state power, but it singled out as an adequate ground for the finding of invalidity that the statute gave no regard to the situation of the employer and to the reasonable value of the service for which the wage was paid. Upon this point the Court said (\n261 U.S. 525\n, at pages 558, 559, 43 S.Ct. 394, 401, 24 A.L.R. 1238): 'The feature of this statute, which perhaps more than any other, puts upon it the stamp of invalidity, is that it exacts from the employer an arbitrary payment for a purpose and upon a basis having no causal connection with his business, or the contract or the work t e employee engages to do. The declared basis, as already \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 624]\n\u00a0\n pointed out, is not the value of the service rendered, but the extraneous circumstance that the employee needs to get a prescribed sum of money to insure her subsistence, health, and morals. The ethical right of every worker, man or woman, to a living wage may be conceded. One of the declared and important purposes of trade organizations is to secure it. And with that principle and with every legitimate effort to realize it in fact, no one can quarrel; but the fallacy of the proposed method of attaining it is that it assumes that every employer is bound at all events to furnish it. The moral requirement implicit in every contract of employment, viz. that the amount to be paid and the service to be rendered shall bear to each other some relation of just equivalence, is completely ignored. ... A statute requiring an employer to pay in money, to pay at prescribed and regular intervals, to pay the value of the services rendered, even to pay with fair relation to the extent of the benefit obtained from the service, would be understandable. But a statute which prescribes payment without regard to any of these things, and solely with relation to circumstances apart from the contract of employment, the business affected by it, and the work done under it, is so clearly the product of a naked, arbitrary exercise of power that it cannot be allowed to stand under the Constitution of the United States.'\n As the New York act is free of that feature, so strongly denounced, the question comes before us in a new aspect. The Court was closely divided in the Adkins Case, and that decision followed an equal division of the Court, after reargument, in Stettler v. O'Hara, \n243 \nU.S. 629\n, 37 S. Ct. 475, with respect to the validity of the minimum wage law of Oregon. Such divisions are at times unavoidable, but they point to the desirability of fresh consideration when there are material differences in the cases presented. The fact that in the Adkins Case there were dissenting opin- \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 625]\n\u00a0\n ions maintaining the validity of the federal statute, despite the nature of the standard it set up, brings out in stronger relief the ground which was taken most emphatically by the majority in that case, and that there would have been a majority for the decision in the absence of that ground must be a matter of conjecture. With that ground absent, the Adkins Case ceases to be a precise authority.\n We have here a question of constitutional law of grave importance, applying to the statutes of several states in a matter of profound public interest. I think that we should deal with that question upon its merits, without feeling that we are bound by a decision which on its facts is not strictly in point.\n Fourth. The validity of the New York act must be considered in the light of the conditions to which the exercise of the protective power of the state was addressed.\n The statute itself recites these conditions and the state has submitted a voluminous factual breif for the purpose of showing from various official statistics that these recitals have abundant support. Judge Lehman, in his dissenting opinion in he Court of Appeals (270 N.Y. 233, 200 N.E. 799, 804), states that the relator 'does not challenge these findings of fact by the Legislature, nor does he challenge the statements in the 'factual brief' submitted by the respondent to sustain and amplify these findings.' The majority opinion in the Court of Appeals has nothing to the contrary. Nor is the statement of the conditions which influenced the legislative action challenged, or challengeable, upon the record here. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 U.S. 61\n, 78-80, 31 S.Ct. 337, Ann.Cas.1912C, 160; Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 44 S. Ct. 325; State of Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, \n274 \nU.S. 392, 397\n, 47 S.Ct. 630; O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251, 257\n, 258 S., 51 S.Ct. 130, 72 A.L. R. 1163; ebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502, 530\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469; Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 194, 209\n, 55 S.Ct. 187. \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 626]\n\u00a0\n The Legislature finds that the employment of women and minors in trade and industry in the state of New York at wages unreasonably low and not fairly commensurate with the value of the services rendered is a matter of vital public concern; that many women and minors are not as a class upon a level of equality in bargaining with their employers in regard to minimum fair wage standards, and that 'freedom of contract' as applied to their relations with employers is illusory; that, by reason of the necessity of seeking support for themselves and their dependents, they are forced to accept whatever wages are offered; and that judged by any reasonable standard, wages in many instances are fixed by chance and caprice and the wages accepted are often found to bear no relation to the fair value of the service. The Legislature further states that women and minors are peculiarily subject 'to the over-reaching of inefficient, harsh or ignorant employers,' and that, in the absence of effective minimum fair wage rates, the constant lowering of wages by unscrupulous employers constitutes a serious form of unfair competition against other employers, reduces the purchasing power of the workers, and threatens the stability of industry. The Legislature deemed it essential to seek the correction of these evils by the exercise of the police power 'for the protection of industry and of the women and minors employed therein and of the public interest of the community at large in their health and well-being and in the prevention of the deterioration of the race.' Section 550 (Labor Law).\n In the factual brief, statistics are presented showing the increasing number of wage-earning women, and that women are in industry and in other fields of employment because they must support themselves and their dependents. Data are submitted, from reports of the Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor, showing such discrepancies and variations in wages paid for \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 627]\n\u00a0\n identical work as to indicate that no relationship exists between the value of the services rendered and the wages paid. It also appears that working women are largely unorganized and that their bargaining power is relatively weak. The seriousness of the social problem is presented. Inquiries by the New York State Department of Labor in co-operation with the Emergency Relief Bureau of New York City disclosed the large number of women employed in industry whose wages were insufficient for the support of themselves and those dependent upon them. For that reason they had been accepted for relief and their wages were being supplemented by payments from the Emergency Relief Bureau. Thus the failure of over-reaching employers to pay to women the wages commensurate with the value of services rendered has imposed a direct and heavy burden upon the taxpayers. The weight of this burden and the necessity for taking reasonable measures to reduce it, in the light of the enormous annual budgetary appropriation for the Department of Public Welfare of New York City, is strikingly exhibited in the brief filed by the corporation counsel of the city as an amicus curiae.\n We are not at liberty to disregard these facts. We must assume that they exist and examine respondent's argument from that standpoint. That argument is addressed to the fundamental postulate of liberty of contract. I think that the argument fails to take account of established principles and ignores the historic relation of the state to the protection of women.\n Fifth. We have had frequent occasion to consider the limitations of liberty of contract. While it is highly important to preserve that liberty from arbitrary and capricious interference, it is also necessary to prevent its abuse, as otherwise it could be used to override all public interests and thus in the end destroy the very freedom o opportunity which it is designed to safeguard. \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 628]\n\u00a0\n We have repeatedly said that liberty of contract is a qualfied and not an absolute right. 'There is no absolute freedom to do as one wills or to contract as one chooses. ... Liberty implies the absence of arbitrary restraint, not immunity from reasonable regulations and prohibitions imposed in the interests of the community.' Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549, 567\n, 31 S.Ct. 259, 262. The numerous restraints that have been sustained have often been recited. Id., \n219 U.S. 549\n, at page 568, 31 S.Ct. 259; Nebbia v. New York, supra, \n291 U.S. 502\n, at pages 526-528, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L. R. 1469. Thus we have upheld the limitation of hours of employment in mines and smelters (Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366\n, 18 S.Ct. 383); the requiring of redemption in cash of store orders or other evidences of indebtedness issued in payment of wages (Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, \n183 \nU.S. 13\n, 22 S.Ct. 1); the prohibition of contracts for options to sell or buy grain or other commodities at a future time (Booth v. Illinois, \n184 \nU.S. 425\n, 22 S.Ct. 425); the forbidding of advance payments to seamen (Patterson v. The Bark Eudora, \n190 \nU.S. 169\n, 23 S.Ct. 821); the prohibition of contracts to pay miners employed at quantity rates upon the basis of screened coal instead of the weight of the coal as originally produced in the mine ( McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 \nU.S. 539\n, 29 S.Ct. 206); the regulation of the size and weight of loaves of bread (Schmidinger v. Chicago, \n226 \nU.S. 578\n, 33 S.Ct. 182, Ann.Cas.1914B, 284; Petersen Baking Co. v. Bryan, \n290 \nU.S. 570\n, 54 S.Ct. 277, 90 A.L.R. 1285); the regulation of insurance rates (German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Lewis, \n233 \nU.S. 389\n, 34 S.Ct. 612, L.R.A.1915C, 1189; O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., supra); the regulation of the size and character of packages in which goods are sold (Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, \n240 \nU.S. 510\n, 36 S.Ct. 440); the limitation of hours of employment in manufacturing establishments with a specified allowance of overtime payment (Bunting v. Oregon, \n243 \nU.S. 426\n, 37 S.Ct. 435, Ann.Cas.1918A, 1043); the regulation of sales of stocks and bonds to prevent fraud (Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., \n242 \nU.S. 539\n, 37 S. Ct. 217, L.R.A.1917F, 514, Ann.Cas.1917C, 643); the regulation of the price of milk (Nebbia v. New York, \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 629]\n\u00a0\n supra). The test of validity is not artificial. It is whether the limitation upon the freedom of contract is arbitrary and capricious or one reasonably required in order appropriately to serve the public interest in the light of the particular conditions to which the power is addressed.\n When there are conditions which specially touch the health and well- being of women, the state may exert its power in a reasonable manner for their protection, whether or not a similar regulation is, or could be, applied to men. The distinctive nature and function of women-their particular relation to the social welfare-has put them in a separate class. This separation and corresponding distinctions in legislation is one of the outstanding traditions of legal history. The Fourteenth Amendment found the states with that protective power and did not take it away or remove the reasons for its exercise. Changes have been effected within the domain of state policy and upon an appraisal of state interests. We have not yet arrived at a time when we are at liberty to override the judgment of the state and decide that women are not the special subject of exploitation because they are women and as such are not in a relatively defenceless position.\n More than forty years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, we said that it did not interfere with state power by creating 'a fictitious equality.' Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 63\n, 32 S.Ct. 92, 193. We called attention to the ample precedents in regulatory provisions for a classification on the basis of sex. We said: 'It has been recognized with regard to hours of work. ... It is recognized in the respective rights of husband and wife in land during life, in the inheritance after the death of the spouse. Often it is expressed in the time fixed for coming of age. ... The particular points at which that difference shall be emphasized by legislation are \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 630]\n\u00a0\n largely in the power of the state.' Id. Not long before the decision in the Quong Wing Case, the question had received elaborate consideration in Muller v. Oregon, \n208 \nU.S. 412\n, 28 S.Ct. 324, 326, 13 Ann. Cas. 957, where a regulation of the working hours of women was sustained. We thought that the disadvantage at which woman was placed in the struggle for subsistence was obvious and we emphasized the point that she 'becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race.' We added that 'though limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be removed by legislation,' woman will still be in a situation 'where some legislation to protect her seems necessary to secure a real equality of right.' She therefore still may be 'properly placed in a class by herself, and legislation designed for her protection may be sustained, even when like legislation is not necessary for men, and could not be sustained.' Muller v. Oregon, supra, \n208 U.S. 412\n, at pages 421, 422, 28 S.Ct. 324, 327, 13 Ann.Cas. 957. This ruling has been followed in Riley v. Massachusetts, \n232 \nU.S. 671\n, 34 S.Ct. 469, Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373\n, 35 S.Ct. 342, L.R.A.1915F, 829, and Bosley v. McLaughlin, \n236 \nU.S. 385\n, 35 S.Ct. 345, with respect to hours of work, and in Radice v. New York, supra, in relation to night work.\n If liberty of contract were viewed from the standpoint of absolute right, there would be as much to be said against a regulation of the hours of labor of women as against the fixing of a minimum wage. Restriction upon hours is a restriction upon the making of contracts and upon earning power. But the right being a qualified one, we must apply in each case the test of reasonableness in the circumstances disclosed. Here, the special conditions calling for the protection of women, and for the protection of society itself, are abundantly shown. The legislation is not less in the interest of the community as a whole than in the interest of the women employees who are paid less than the value of their services. That lack must be made goods out of the public \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 631]\n\u00a0\n purse. Granted that the burden of the support of women who do not receive a living wage cannot be transferred to employers who pay the equivalent of the service they obtain, there is no reason why the burden caused by the failure to pay that equivalent should not be placed upon those who create it. The fact that the state cannot secure the benefit to society of a living wage for women employees by any enactment which bears unreasonably upon employers does not preclude the state from seeking its objective by means entirely fair both to employers and the women employed.\n In the statute before us, no unreasonableness appears. The end is legitimate and the means appropriate. I think that the act should be upheld.\n I am authorized to state that Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice STONE, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n While I agree with all that the CHIEF JUSTICE has said, I would not make the differences between the present statute and that involved in theAdkins Case the sole basis of decision. I attach little importance to the fact that the earlier statute was aimed only at a starvation wage and that the present one does not prohibit such a wage unless it is also less than the reasonable value of the service. Since neither statute compels employment at any wage, I do not assume that employer in one case, more than in the other, would pay the minimum wage if the service were worth less.\n The vague and general pronouncement of the Fourteenth Amendment against deprivation of liberty without due process of law is a limitation of legislative power, not a formula for its exercise. It does not purport to say in what particular manner that power shall be exerted. \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 632]\n\u00a0\n It makes no finespun distinctions between methods which the legislature may and which it may not choose to solve a pressing problem of government. It is plain too, that, unless the language of the amendment and the decisions of this Court are to be ignored, the liberty which the amendment protects is not freedom from restraint of all law or of any law which reasonable men may think an appropriate means for dealing with any of those matters of public concern with which it is the business of government to deal. There is grim irony in speaking of the freedom of contract of those who, because of their economic necessities, give their service for less than is needful to keep body and soul together. But if this is freedom of contract no one has ever denied that it is freedom which may be restrained, notwithstanding the Fourteenth Amendment, by a statute passed in the public interest.\n In many cases this Court has sustained the power of legislatures to prohibit or restrict the terms of a contract, including the price term, in order to accomplish what the legislative body may reasonably consider a public purpose. They include cases, which have neither been overruled nor discredited, in which the sole basis of regulation was the fact that circumstances, beyond the control of the parties, had so seriously curtailed the regulative power of competition as to place buyers or sellers at a disadvantage in the bargaining struggle, such that a legislature might reasonably have contemplated serious consequences to the community as a whole and have sought to avoid them by regulation of the terms of the contract.

Harbison, \n183 \nU.S. 13\n, 22 S.Ct. 1; McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 \nU.S. 539\n, 29 S.Ct. 206; Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, \n222 \nU.S. 225\n, 32 S.Ct. 74, Ann.Cas.1913B, 529.\n No one doubts that the presence in the community of a large number of those compelled by economic necessity to accept a wage less than is needful for subsistence is a matter of grave public concern, the more so when, as has been demonstrated here, it tends to produce ill health, immorality and deterioration of the race. The fact that at one time or another Congress and the legislatures of seventeen states, and the legislative bodies of twenty-one foreign countries, including Great Britain and its four commonwealths, have found that wage regulation is an appropriate corrective for serious social and economic maladjustments growing out of inequality in bargaining power, precludes, for me, any assumption that it is a remedy beyond the bounds of reason. It is difficult to imagine any grounds, other than our own personal economic predilections, for saying that the contract of employment is any the less an appropriate subject of legislation than are scores of others, in dealing with which this Court has held that legislatures may curtail individual freedom in the public interest.\n If i is a subject upon which there is power to legislate at all, the Fourteenth Amendment makes no distinction between the methods by which legislatures may deal with it, any more than it proscribes the regulation of one term of a bargain more than another if it is properly the subject of regulation. No one has yet attempted to say upon what basis of history, principles of government, law or logic, it is within due process to regulate the hours and conditions of labor of women, see Muller v. Oregon, \n208 \nU.S. 412\n, 28 S.Ct. 324, 13 Ann.Cas. 957; Riley v. Massachusetts, \n232 \nU.S. 671, 679\n, 34 S.Ct. 469; Hawley v. Walker, \n232 \nU.S. 718\n, 34 S.Ct. 479; Miller v.

Lewis, supra, or of the commissions of insurance brokers, O'Gorman & Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S.Ct. 130, 72 A.L.R. 1163, or of the charges of grain elevators, Munn v. Illinois, supra; Brass v. Stoeser (State of North Dakota), supra, or of the price which the farmer receives for his milk, or which the wage earner pays for it, Nebbia v. New York, supra.\n These considerations were developed at length in Tyson v. Banton, \n273 U.S. 418\n, 447, et seq., 47 S.Ct. 426, 58 A.L.R. 1236, and in Ribnik v. McBride, \n277 U.S. 350\n, 359, et seq., 48 S.Ct. 545, 56 A.L.R. 1327, and need not be further elaborated now. It is true that the Court rejected them there, but it later accepted and applied them as the basis of decision in O'Gorman & Young, Inc. v. Harford Fire Ins. Co., supra; Nebbia v. New York, supra; Hegeman Farms Corporation v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 163\n, 55 S.Ct. 7; Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Ten Eyck, \n297 \nU.S. 251\n, 56 S.Ct. 453, decided February 10, 1936. Both precedent, and, what is more important, reason, require their acceptance now. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393, 405\n, 52 S.Ct. 443. In upholding minimum state price regulation in the milk industry, in Nebbia v. New York, supra, the Court declared, \n291 U.S. 502\n, at page 537, 54 S.Ct. 505, 516, 89 A.L.R. 1469: 'So far as the requirement of due process is concerned, and in the absence of other constitutional restriction, a state is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose. \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 635]\n\u00a0\n The courts are without authority either to declare such policy, or, when it is declared by the legislature, to override it. If the laws passed are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process are satisfied, and judicial determination to that effect renders a court functus officio.' That declaration and decision should control the present case. They are irreconcilable with the decision and most that was said in the Adkins Case. They have left the Court free of its restriction as a precedent, and free to declare that the choice of the particular form of regulation by which grave economic maladjustments are to be remedied is for legislatures and not the courts.\n In the years which have intervened since the Adkins Case we have had opportunity to learn that a wage is not always the resultant of free bargaining between employers and employees; that it may be one forced upon employees by their economic necessities and upon employers by the most ruthless of their competitors. We have had opportunity to perceive more clearly that a wage insufficient to support the worker does not visit its consequences upon him alone; that it may affect profoundly the entire economic structure of society and, in any case, that it casts on every taxpayer, and on government itself, the burden of solving the problems of poverty, subsistence, health, and morals of large numbers in the community. Because of their nature and extent these are public problems. A generation ago they were for the individual to solve; to-day they are the burden of the nation. I can perceive no more objection, on constitutional grounds, to their solution by requring an industry to bear the subsistence cost of the labor which it employs, than to the imposition upon it of the cost of its industrial accidents. See New York Central R.R. Co. v. White, supra; Mountain Timber Company v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S.Ct. 260, Ann.Cas.1917D, 642. \n\n[298 U.S. 587, 636]\n\u00a0\n It is not for the courts to resolve doubts whether the remedy by wage regulation is as efficacious as many believe, or is better than some other, or is better even than the blind operation of uncontrolled economic forces. The legislature must be free to choose unless government is to be rendered impotent. The Fourteenth Amendment has no more embedded in the Constitution our preference for some particular set of economic beliefs, than it has adopted, in the name of liberty, the system of theology which we may happen to approve.\n I know of no rule or practice by which the arguments advanced in support of an application for certiorari restrict our choice between conflicting precedents in deciding a question of constitutional law which the petition, if granted, requires us to answer. Here the question which the petition specifically presents is whether the New York statute contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment. In addition, the petition assigns as a reason for granting it that 'the construction and application of the Constitution of the United States and a prior decision' of this Court 'are necessarily involved,' and again, that 'the circumstances prevailing under which the New York law was enacted call for a reconsideration of the Adkins Case in the light of the New York act and conditions aimed to be remedied thereby.' Unless we are now to construe and apply the Fourteenth Amendment without regard to our decisions since the Adkins Case, we could not rightly avoid its reconsideration even if it were not asked. We should follow our decision in the Nebbia Case and leave the selection and the method of the solution of the problems to which the statute is addressed where it seems to me the Constitution has left them, to the legislative branch of the government. The judgment should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 299 U.S. --, 57 S.Ct. 4, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Briefs amici curiae in support of the application were filed by the city of New York and the state of Illinois.

Adding the words in brackets and omitting those in italics, there is indicated the background in the bill that was not approved.\n'The employment of (men and) women and minors in trade and idustry in the state of New York at wages unreasonably low and not fairly commensurate with the value of the services rendered is a matter of grave and vital public concern. Many (men and) women and minors employed for gain in the state of New York are not as a class upon a level of equality in bargaining with their employers in regard to minimum fair wage standards, and 'freedom of contract' as applied to their relations with their employers is illusory. Since a very large percentage of such workers are obliged from their week to week wages to support themselves and others who are dependent upon them in whole or in part they are, by reason of their necessitous circumstances, forced to accept whatever wages are offered them. Judged by any reasonable standard, wages are in many cases fixed by chance and caprice and the wages accepted are often found to bear no relation to the fair value of the service rendered. Women and minors employed for gain are peculiarly subject to the overreaching of inefficient, harsh or ignorant employers and under unregulated competition where no adequate machinery exists for the effective regulation and maintenance of minimum fair wage standards, (and) the standards such as exist tend to be set by the least conscionable employers. In the absence of any effective minimum fair wage rates for women and minors, the constant lowering of wages by unscrupulous employers constitutes a serious form of unfair competition against other employers, reduces the purchasing power of the workers (a large proportion of the population of the state) and threatens the stability of industry. The evils of oppressive, unreasonable and unfair wages as they affect women and minors employed in the state of New York are such as to render imperative the exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of industry and of the (men and) women and minors employed therein and of the public interest of the community at large in their health and well-being and in the prevention of the deterioration of the race. In the considered judgment of the legislature this article is constitutional.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Mr. Justice Brandeis took no part in the consideration of the Adkins Case.

Pierson, of Compton, Cal., and George E. Remley and Harry S. Bowman, both of Santa Fe , N.M., for appellants.\n Messrs. Quincy D. Adams and Frank H. Patton, both of Santa fe , N.M., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on appeal, Judicial Code,  238 (28 U.S.C.A.  345), from a decree of the District Court for New Mexico, three judges sitting, Piper v. Bingaman, 12 F.Supp. 755, dismissing the bill of complaint by which appellant sought to enjoin appellee, the state Commissioner of Revenue, from enforcing the provisions of a state law exacting a permit fee for the privilege of transporting motor vehicles over the highways of the state for purpose of sale.\n The statute assailed, chapter 56 of the New Mexico Session Laws of 1935, denies to all persons the use of the highways of the state for the transportation of any motor vehicle, on its own wheels, for the purpose of selling it or offering it for sale within or without the state, unless the vehicle is (1) licensed by the state, or is (2) owned by a licensed automobile dealer and operated under a \n\n[298 U.S. 407, 409]\n\u00a0\n dealer's license, or is (3) operated under a special permit issued by the state Commissioner of Revenue for its transportation. For such a permit the statute levies a fee of $7.50 if the vehicle is transported by its own power, and a fee of $5 if it is towed or drawn by another vehicle.\n A later act, chapter 136 of New Mexico Session Laws of 1935, provides for establishing registration stations or 'ports of entry,' on the main highways of the state, at which permits are to be issued and fees collected. It provides that no vehicle for which a permit is required shall receive a permit or be allowed to proceed until inspected and found to be in safe and roadworthy condition, properly equipped with all lights, brakes, and other appliances required by state law.\n Appellant, a resident and citizen of California, is engaged in the business of purchasing new and used automobiles in eastern and southern states of the United States, and transporting them, on their own wheels, over state highways to California, where he offers them for sale. He customarily transports such cars over the highways of New Mexico for a distance of about 166 miles, in processions, or caravans.\n Chapter 56 is challenged here, as it was below, as imposing an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and as infringing the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellant also urges that the taxing provisions of this act, enacted February 21, 1935, were repealed by the passage a week later, of the 'Ports of Entry Act,' chapter 136 of the Session Laws of 1935. The trial court held that the earlier act had not been repealed, and construed it as exacting the permit fee for the privilege of using the state highways, and as not exempting from the fee, cars operated under a dealers' license when transported for sale. It thought that the statute is aimed at the consid- \n\n[298 U.S. 407, 410]\n\u00a0\n erable business in the state, as shown by the record, of transporting automobiles, usually in caravans, over state highways for sale; that such transportation constitutes a distinct class of automobile traffic, which causes increased wear and tear or the highways and interferes with their safe and convenient use by others; that these circumstances justify a separate classification of the traffic for the purpose of exercising police control over it and fixing a fee or tax for the privilege of transporting automobiles over the highways in such traffic. The court ac ordingly held that the statute infringes no constitutional limitation on state power.\n\n 1. \nWe see no reason, and none is suggested, for not accepting the construction of the statute adopted by the trial court. The statute applies alike to all automobiles transported for sale, whether moving intrastate or interstate. Unlike the general tax in Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, \n283 \nU.S. 183\n, 51 S.Ct. 380, the levy of which was unrelated to the use of the highways, grant of the privilege of their use is by the present statute made conditional upon payment of the fee. The manner of its collection, not unlike that of a toll for the privilege of entering and using the highways, definitely identifies it as a charge for the privilege. It is not shown to exceed a reasonable charge for the privilege and for defraying the cost of police regulation of the traffic involved, such as a state may impose, if nondiscriminatory, on automobiles moving over its highways interstate. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610\n, 35 S.Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S.Ct. 30; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S.Ct. 702; Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, \n283 \nU.S. 183\n, 51 S.Ct. 380; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, \n295 \nU.S. 285\n, 55 S.Ct. 709\n\n\n The facts, as stipulated, establish that the transportation of automobiles across the state in caravans, for purpose of sale, is a distinct class of business, of considerable magnitude. Large numbers of such cars move over the \n\n[298 U.S. 407, 411]\n\u00a0\n highways in caravans or processions. Seventy-five to eighty per cent. of the cars in appellant's caravans are in units of two, coupled together by tow bars. Each unit is in charge of a single driver, who operates the forward car and thus controls the movement of both cars by the use of the mechanism and brakes of one. Appellant's drivers, except two or three regularly employed, are casually engaged. They usually serve without pay and bear their own expenses in order to secure transportation to the point of destination, although a few receive very small remuneration and expenses. The Legislature may readily have concluded, as did the trial court, that the drivers have little interest in the business or the vehicles they drive and less regard than drivers of state licensed cars for the safety and convenience of others using the highways. The evidence supports the inference that cars thus coupled and controlled frequently skid, especially on curves, causing more than the usual wear and tear on the road; that this and other increased difficulties in the operation of the coupled cars, and the length of the caravans, increase the inconvenience and hazard to passing traffic. Car trouble to any one car sometimes results in stalling the entire caravan. The state has found it expedient to make special provisions for the inspection and policing of caravans moving in this traffic.\n There is ample support for a legislative determination that the peculiar character of this traffic involves a special type of use of the highways, with enhanced wear and tear on the roads and augmented hazards to other traffic, which imposes on the state a heavier financial burden for highway maintenance and policing than do other types of motor car traffic. We cannot say that these circumstances do not afford an adequate basis for special licensing and taxing provisions, whose only effect, even when applied to interstate traffic, is to enable the \n\n[298 U.S. 407, 412]\n\u00a0\n state to police it, and to impose upon it a reasonable charge, to defray the burden of this state expense, and for the privilege of using the state highways.\n As the tax is not on the use of the highways but on the privilege of using them, without specific limitation as to mileage, the levy of a flat fee not shown to be unreasonable in amount, rather than of a fee based on mileage, is not a forbidden burden on interstate commerce. See Clark v. Poor, supra; Aero Mayflower ransit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, supra.\n Nor is it important that a part of the fees collected is not devoted directly to highway maintenance, the cost of which the state pays in part from the proceeds of a general property tax. The use for highway maintenance of a fee collected from automobile owners may be of significance, when the point is otherwise in doubt, to show that the fee is in fact laid for that purpose and is thus a charge for the privilege of using the highways. Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, supra. But where the manner of the levy, like that prescribed by the present statute, definitely identifies it as a fee charged for the grant of the privilege, it is immaterial whether the state places the fees collected in the pocket out of which it pays highway maintenance charges or in some other.\n\n 2. \nIt is not denied that automobiles moving in caravans, as do appellant's, constitute a class of traffic which may be taxed differently from other classes without infringing the equal protection clause. But it is insisted that such is not the classification of the statute. It is said that the statute in terms imposes the special permit fee on every automobile transported for sale, whether moving singly or in a caravan; that when moving singly, a car, merely because intended for sale, presents no differences from like cars, moving for other purposes, which would afford any basis for a difference in taxation. But this argument both ignores the actual circumstances in \n\n[298 U.S. 407, 413]\n\u00a0\n which the statute is applied, as shown by the record, and seeks to take advantage of an alleged discrimination which, if it exists, does the appellant no harm.\n There is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment which requires classification for taxation to follow any particular form of words. If that adopted results in the application of the tax to a class which may be separately taxed without a denial of equal protection, those within the class who are called upon to pay the tax cannot complain that the taxed class might have been more aptly defined, or that the statute may tax others who are not within the class. Here it is the practice of transporting automobiles over the highways for purpose of sale which has given rise to the practice of moving them in caravans. The use of automobiles for other business purposes, or for pleasure, does not have that result. So far as it appears, the movement of cars singly for purposes of sale is negligible, and it is shown affirmatively that the cars transported for sale by appellant move in caravans. The classification of the statute thus, in its practical operation, embraces and is constitutionally applicable to cars moving in caravans, the class of traffic in which the appellant engages and on which he is alone taxed. Such discrimination as there may be is not between those who, like appellant, drive their automobiles to market in caravans and others who drive them singly, for both are taxed. Discrimination, if any, is between those who drive their cars to market singly and others who drive them for other purposes, and may be subjected to a different tax. Appellant does not assert that he belongs to either class. As the traffic in which he participates is properly taxed, he cannot complain of the imposition of the tax on a business which he does not do. Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, \n271 \nU.S. 50, 54\n, 55 S., 46 S.Ct. 375, 45 A.L.R. 1495; Keeney v. New York, \n222 \nU.S. 525, 536\n, 537 S., 32 S.Ct. 105, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1139; Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 153\n, 160 S., 161, 27 S.Ct. 188, 9 Ann.Cas. 736. Cf. Collins v. Texas, \n223 \nU.S. 288\n, 32 S.Ct. 286; Dillingham v. McLaughlin, \n264 \nU.S. 370, 374\n, 44 S. Ct. 362. We have no occasion \n\n[298 U.S. 407, 414]\n\u00a0\n to pass upon the validity of the tax as applied to cars driven singly.\n\n 3. \nIn the absence of a controlling decision by the state courts, we see no reason for rejecting the conclusion of the District Court that the fee provisions of cha ter 56 of the New Mexico Session Laws of 1935 were not repealed by chapter 136, passed a week later at the same session of the Legislature. As already indicated, the latter makes provision for the administration of the special permit provisions of the earlier statute. It also, by sections 8, 6, and 13, levies a graduated mileage tax (1 1\/2 cents per mile for cars not exceeding 15,000 pounds in weight) upon motor vehicles not registered or licensed in the state, transported over the highways for purpose of sale. The statute declares that the tax is levied for the support of the administration of the act, and for the maintenance of the highways.\n Appellant does not assail this tax, but insists that it was intended as a substitute for the flat fee charged by the earlier provisions for a special permit. If the later tax, as the District Court held, is imposed on motor cars transported as are appellant's, it is not inconsistent with the imposition of the flat permit fee, but supplementary to it. Repeal by implication is not favored, especially where the one act follows close upon the other, at the same session of the Legislature. Cf. Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409\n, 51 S.Ct. 186; Rodgers v. United States, \n185 \nU.S. 83, 89\n, 22 S.Ct. 582; Beals v. Hale, 4 How. 37, 53. Moreover, the later act in this case was careful to provide that the new mileage tax which it imposes is not to apply to vehicles licensed and entitled to license plates, and otherwise taxed, under state law. The statute thus grants an explicit exemption from double taxation which it omits to extend to motor cars which, like appellant's, secure a special permit and do not receive state licenses and license plates.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 299 U.S. --, S.Ct. 4, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMORGAN v.

Packers and Stockyards Act 1921, 42 Stat. 159, 7 U.S.C.  181-229, 7 U.S.C.A.  181 et seq. \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 472]\n\u00a0\n The proceeding was instituted by an order of the Secretary of Agriculture in April, 1930, directing an inquiry into the reasonableness of existing rates. Testimony was taken and an order prescribing rates followed in May, 1932. An application for rehearing, in view of changed economic conditions, was granted in July, 1932. After the taking of voluminous testimony, which was concluded in November, 1932, the order in question was made on June 14, 1933. Rehearing was refused on July 6, 1933\n\n\n Plaintiffs then brought these suits attacking the order, so far as it prescribed maximum charges for selling livestock, as illegal and arbitrary and as depriving plaintiffs of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. The District Court of three judges entered decrees sustaining the order and dismissing the bills of complaint. 8 F.Supp. 766. Motions for rehearing were denied, and, by stipulation, the separate decrees were set aside and a joint and final decree was entered to the same effect. Plaintiffs bring this direct appeal. 7 U.S.C.  217, 7 U.S.C.A.  217; 28 U.S.C.  47, 28 U.S.C.A.  47.\n On the merits, plaintiffs assert that the ultimate basis for the reduction in commission rates is the Secretary's opinion that there are too many market agencies, too many salesmen, and too much competition in the business; that the Secretary has departed entirely from the evidence as to the actual cost of employing salesmen in selling cattle at these yards and has made an allowance for salaries which is based on pure speculation and is wholly inadequate to meet the cost of the service; that he has substituted in place of his accountants' figures as to actual expenditures, with respect to the item entitled 'Business Getting and Maintaining Expense,' a hypothetical allowance greatly less than actual cost; and that the Secretary has thus made findings without evidence and an order, essentially arbitrary, which prescribes \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 473]\n\u00a0\n unreasonable rates. The Government answers that, while the Secretary is not authorized expressly to prescribe or limit the number of firms that may engage in the market agency business, he is under a duty to take cognizance of evidence tending to show that, under present competitive conditions, certain costs actually incurred are unreasonable; that, in determining what are just and reasonable rates, he must give consideration to evidence of the excessiveness of costs, and, if such evidence shows that there are many market agencies not receiving a sufficient volume of business to entitle their costs to be regarded as reasonable, the Secretary must take cognizance of that fact; that it was in this view that the Secretary made certain findings as to the inadequacy of the present business at the stockyards to support economically all the firms now striving to make a profit; that his findings, supported by evidence, were directly pertinent to the determination of reasonable costs, and, so determining, the Secretary was authorized to fix the rates prescribed in his order.\n Before reaching these questions, we meet at the threshold of the controversy plaintiffs' additional contention that they have not been accorded the hearing which the statute requires. They rightly assert that the granting of that hearing is a prerequisite to the making of a valid order. The statute provides (42 Stat. 159, 166,  310; 7 U.S.C.  211, 7 U. S.C.A.  211):\n'Sec. 310. Whenever after full hearing upon a complaint made as provided in section 309 (section 210 of this chapter), or after full hearing under an order for investigation and hearing made by the Secretary on his own initiative, either in extension of any pending complaint or without any complaint whatever, the Secretary is of the opinion that any rate, charge, regulation, or practice of a stockyard owner or market agency, for or in connection with the furnishing of stockyard services, is or will be unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory, the Secretary- \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 474]\n\u00a0\n '(a) May determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable rate or charge, or rates or charges, to be thereafter observed in such case, or the maximum or minimum, or maximum and minimum, to be charged, and what regulation or practice is or will be just, reasonable, and non- discriminatory to be thereafter followed.'\n\n The allegations as to the failure to give a proper hearing are set forth in paragraph IV of the bill of complaint, quoted in full in the margin. \n1\n The allegations in substance are: That separate hearings were not accorded to the respective respondents (plaintiffs here). That, at he \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 475]\n\u00a0\n conclusion of the taking of the testimony before an examiner, a request was made that the examiner prepare a tentative report, which should be subject to oral argument and exceptions, so that a hearing might be had before the Secretary without undue inconvenience to him, but that the request was denied, and no tentative report was exhibited to plaintiffs and no oral argument upon the issues presented by the order of inquiry and the evidence was at any time had before the Secretary. That the Secretary, without warrant of law, delegated to Acting Secretaries the determination of issues \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 476]\n\u00a0\n with respect to the reasonableness of the rates involved. That, when the oral arguments were presented after the original hearing, and after the rehearing, the Secretary was neither sick, absent, nor otherwise disabled, but was at his office in the Department of Agriculture, and the appointment of any other person as Acting Secretary was illegal. That the Secretary at the time he signed the order in question had not personally heard or read any of the evidence presented at any hearing in connection with the proceeding, and had not heard or considered oral arguments relating thereto or briefs submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs, but that the sole information of the Secretary with respect to the proceeding was derived from consultation with employees in the Department of Agriculture out of the presence of the plaintiffs or any of their representatives.\n On motion of the government, the District Court struck out all the allegations in paragraph IV of the bill of complaint, and the plaintiffs were thus denied opportunity to require an answer to these allegations or to prove the facts alleged.\n Certain facts appear of record. The testimony was taken before an examiner. At its conclusion, counsel for respondents stated 'that he would continue to demand that the Secretary hear personally the argument of the evidence in behalf of the individual respondents, or at least have some definte course of procedure adopted whereby the examiner, or some one else, should formulate a report on the evidence so that the respondents could have the character of hearing and right to present their side of the issues in this case, which they believe the law entitles them to.' The government does not suggest that this request was granted, and plaintiffs say that it was denied. Oral argument upon the evidence was had before the Acting Secretary of Agriculture. Subsequently, brief was filed on plaintiffs' be- \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 477]\n\u00a0\n half. Thereafter, reciting 'careful consideration of the entire record in this proceeding,' findings of fact and conclusions, and an order prescribing rates, were signed by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n First. The Packers and Stockyards Act makes the provisions of all laws relating to the 'suspending or restraining the enforcement' or the 'setting aside' of the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission applicable to the 'jurisdiction, powers, and duties of the Secretary' in enforcing the provisions of the act.

Abilene & Southern Railway Co., \n265 U.S. 274\n, 286-290, 44 S.Ct. 565; Florida v. United States, \n282 U.S. 194\n, 212-215, 51 S. Ct. 119. When the Secretary acts within the authority conferred by the statute, his findings of fact are conclusive. Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra; St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 80 L.Ed. --, decided April 27, 1936; Acker v. United States, supra. But, in determining whether in conducting an administrative proceeding of this sort the Secretary has complied with the statutory prerequisites, the recitals of his procedure cannot be regarded as conclusive. Otherwise the statutory conditions could be set at naught by mere assertion. If upon the facts alleged the 'full hearing' required by the statute was not given, plaintiffs were entitled to prove the facts and have the Secretary's order set aside. Nor is it necessary to go beyond the terms of the statute in order to consider the constitutional requirement of due process as to notice and hearing. For the statute itself demands a full hearing, and the order is void if such a hearing was \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 478]\n\u00a0\n denied. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185; United States v. Abilene & Southern Railway Co., supra; Florida v. United States, supra; United States v. Baltimore & O.R.R. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 454, 464\n, 55 S.Ct. 268.\n Second. The outstanding allegation, which the District Court struck out, is that the Secretary made the rate order without having heard or read any of the evidence, and without having heard the oral arguments or having read or considered the briefs which the plaintiffs submitted. That the only information which the Secretary had as to the proceeding was what he derived from consultation with employees of the Department.\n The other allegations of the stricken paragraph do not go to the root of the matter. Thus it cannot be said that the failure to hear the respondents separately was an abuse of discretion. Again, while it would have been good practice to have the examiner prepare a report and submit it to the Secretary and the parties, and to permit exceptions and arguments addressed to the points thus presented-a practice found to be of great value in proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission-we cannot say that that particular type of procedure was essential to the validity of the hearing. The statute does not require it, and what the statute does require relates to substance and not form.\n Nor should the fundamental question be confused with one of mere delegation of authority. The government urges that the Acting Secretary who heard the oral argument was in fact the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, whose duties are prescribed by the Act of February 9, 1889,  2 (5 U.S.C.  517, 5 U.S.C.A.  517), providing for his appointment and authorizing him to perform such duties in the conduct of the business of the Department of Agriculture as may be assigned to him by the Secretary. If the Secretary had assigned to the Assistant Secretary the duty of holding the hearing, and the Assistant Secretary accordingly \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 479]\n\u00a0\n had received the evidence taken by the examiner, had heard argument thereon, and had then found the essential facts and made the order upon his findings, we should have had simply the question of delegation. But, while the Assistant Secretary heard argument, he did not make the decision. The Secretary who, according to the allegation, had neither heard nor read evidence or argument, undertook to make the findings and fix the rates. The Assistant Secretary, who had heard, assumed no responsibility for the findings or order, and the Secretary, who had not heard, did assume that responsibility.\n We may likewise put aside the contention as to the circumstances in which an Acting Secretary may take the place of his chief. In the course of administrative routine, the disposition of official matters by an Acting Secretary is frequently necessary, and the integrity of administration demands that credit be given to his action in that capacity. We have no such question here. The Acting Secretary did not assume to make the order.\n Third. What is the essential quality of the proceeding under review, and what is the nature of the hearing which the statute prescribes?\n The proceeding is not one of ordinary administration, conformable to the standards governing duties of a purely executive character. It is a proceeding looking to legislative action in the fixing of rates of market agencies. And, while the order is legislative and gives to the proceeding its distinctive character (Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 307\n, 34 S.Ct. 48), it is a proceeding which by virtue of the authority co ferred has special attributes. The Secretary, as the agent of Congress in making the rates, must make them in accordance with the standards and under the limitations which Congress has prescribed. Congress has required the Secretary to determine, as a condition of his action, that the existing rates are or will be 'unjust, unreasonable, or discrimina- \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 480]\n\u00a0\n tory.' If and when he so finds, he may 'determine and prescribe' what shall be the just and reasonable rate, or the maximum or minimum rate, thereafter to be charged. That duty is widely different from ordinary executive action. It is a duty which carries with it fundamental procedural requirements. There must be a full hearing. There must be evidence adequate to support pertinent and necessary findings of fact. Nothing can be treated as evidence which is not introduced as such. United States v. Abilene & Southern Railway Co., supra. Facts and circumstances which ought to be considered must not be excluded. Facts and circumstances must not be considered which should not legally influence the conclusion. Findings based on the evidence must embrace the basic facts which are needed to sustain the order. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., supra; Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 44 S. Ct. 317; United States v. Abilene & Southern Railway Co., supra; Florida v. United States, supra; United States v. Baltimore & O.R.R. Co., supra.\n A proceeding of this sort requiring the taking and weighing of evidence, determinations of fact based upon the consideration of the evidence, and the making of an order supported by such findings, has a quality resembling that of a judicial proceeding. Hence it is frequently described as a proceeding of a quasi judicial character. The requirement of a 'full hearing' has obvious reference to the tradition of judicial proceedings in which evidence is received and weighed by the trier of the facts. The 'hearing' is designed to afford the safeguard that the one who decides shall be bound in good conscience to consider the evidence, to be guided by that alone, and to reach his conclusion uninfluenced by extraneous considerations which in other fields might have play in determining purely executive action. The 'hearing' is the hearing of evidence and argument. If the one who de- \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 481]\n\u00a0\n termines the facts which underlie the order has not considered evidence or argument, it is manifest that the hearing has not been given.\n There is thus no basis for the contention that the authority conferred by section 310 of the Packers and Stockyards Act is given to the Department of Agriculture, as a department in the administrative sense, so that one official may examine evidence, and another official who has not considered the evidence may make the findings and order. In such a view, it would be possible, for example, for one official to hear the evidence and argument and arrive at certain conclusions of fact and another official who had not heard or considered either evidence or argument to overrule those conclusions and for reasons of policy to announce entirely different ones. It is no answer to say that the question for the court is whether the evidence supports the findings and the findings support the order. For the weight ascribed by the law to the findings-their conclusiveness when made within the sphere of the authority conferred- rests upon the assumption that the officer who makes the findings has addressed himself to the evidence, and upon that evidence has conscientiously reached the conclusions which he deems it to justify. That duty cannot be performed by one who has not considered evidence or argument. It is not an impersonal obligation. It is a duty akin to that of a judge. The one who decides must hear.\n This necessary rule does not preclude practicable administrative procedure in obtaining the aid of assistants in the department. Assistants may prosecute inquiries. Evidence may be taken by an examiner. Evidence thus taken may be sifted and analyzed by competent subordinates. Argument may be oral or written. The requirements are not technical. But there must be a hearing in a substantial sense And to give the substance of a hearing, which is for the purpose of making deter- \n\n[298 U.S. 468, 482]\n\u00a0\n minations upon evidence, the officer who makes the determinations must consider and appraise the evidence which justifies them. That duty undoubtedly may be an onerous one, but the performance of it in a substantial manner is inseparable from the exercise of the important authority conferred.\n The government presses upon our attention the case of Local Government Board v. Arlidge (1915) A.C. 120, reversing King v. Local Government Board (1914) 1 K.B. 160. That case has provoked much discussion, but we do not think it necessary to review it, as it relates to a different sort of administrative action and is not deemed to be pertinent to a proceeding under the statute before us and to the hearing which is required by the principles established by our decisions.\n Our conclusion is that the District Court erred in striking out the allegations of paragraph IV of the bill of complaint with respect to the Secretary's action. The defendants should be required to answer these allegations, and the question whether plaintiffs had a proper hearing should be determined.\n The decree is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Paragraph IV of the bill of complaint is as follows:\n'Petitioner states that the Order is null and void in that this petitioner was denied a full hearing before the Secretary upon the matters and things referred to in the Order of Inquiry as provided for in said Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, and the enforcement of the Order would take Petitioner's property without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that:\n\n'(a) The Secretary overruled and denied the request of this petitioner for a separate, individual and independent hearing apart from any other of the respondents named in said Notice of Inquiry to the prejudice of this petitioner.\n\n'(b) This petitioner requested at the conclusion of the hearings held under said Notice of Inquiry before the said John C. Brooke, that said Examiner prepare a tentative report upon the evidence to be presented to the petitioner and the Secretary subject to oral argument as to any exceptions thereto which the petitioner might care to present, so that in this manner a hearing might be had before the Secretary without undue inconvenience to the Secretary, but said request was denied and no tentative report was exhibited to petitioner and no oral argument upon the issues presented by said Order of Inquiry and the evidence taken by said Examiner was at any time had before the Secretary.\n\n'(c) The Secretary, without warrant or authority of law, delegated to the said R. W. Dunlap and Rexford G. Tugwell, purporting to be at the times hereinbefore named Acting Secretaries of Agriculture, authorities and powers vested solely in the Secretary involving the exercise of discretion and the determination of issues in respect to the justice, reasonableness and lawfulness of the rates and charges of this petitioner. At each and all of the times hereinabove referred to, when the said oral arguments were presented after the original hearing in said proceeding and after the re-hearing thereof, the then Secretary of Agriculture was in Washington, D.C., at his office in the Department of Agriculture, and at said time was neither sick, absent, nor from any other cause disabled in the performance of official duties of said Secretary of Agriculture, and a purported appointment of any other person as Acting Secretary of Agriculture was illegal, null and void under the laws of the United States. \n\n'(d) Petitioner states on information and belief, and, therefore, alleges the fact to be, that the Secretary at the time said Order was sgned by him had not personally heard or read any of the evidence presented at any hearing in connection with this proceeding and had not heard or considered oral arguments relating thereto submitted on behalf of this petitioner and had (sic) read or considered any briefs submitted by petitioner in this proceeding, but that the sole information of said Secretary with respect to said proceeding was derived from consultation with employees in the Department of Agriculture, out of the presence of this petitioner or any representative of this petitioner.\n\n'By reason of each and all of the foregoing facts, petitioner avers that said course of action so taken by the Secretary was without warrant and authority of law, and by reason of each and all of the acts and omissions in this paragraph referred to (including the denial of petitioner's request for a separate hearing and the overruling of objections) this petitioner has been denied the 'full hearing' before the Secretary to which the petitioner is entitled under said Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, and under the Constitution of the United States.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOUNTAIN STATES POWER CO. v.

They were attacked as confiscatory by separate bills in the United States District Court. That court, three judges sitting, granted motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. These direct appeals question its action.\n Prior to May 14, 1934, paragraph (1),  24, Judicial Code, as amended ( U.S.C.A. tit. 28,  41(1), provided:\n'The district courts shall have original jurisdiction as follows:\n\n'(1) Of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, brought by the United States, or by any officer thereof authorized by law to sue, or between citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants from different States; or, where the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000, and (a) arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority, or (b) is between citizens of different States, or (c) is between citizens of a State and foreign States, citizens, or subjects.'\n\n On that day the so-called Johnson Act, 48 Stat. c. 283, p. 775 (28 U. S.C.A.  41(1, 1a) became effective. Section 1 directs:\n'That the first paragraph of section 24 of the Judicial Code, as amended, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following: 'Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, no district court shall have jurisdiction of any suit \n\n[299 U.S. 167, 169]\n\u00a0\n to enjoin, suspend, or restrain the enforcement, operation, or execution of any order of an administrative board or commission of a State, or any rate-making body of any political subdivision thereof, or to enjoin, suspend, or restrain any action in compliance with any such order, where jurisdiction is based solely upon the ground of diversity of citizenship, or the repugnance of such order to the Constitution of the United States, where such order (1) affects rates chargeable by a public utility, (2) does not interfere with interstate commerce, and (3) has been made after reasonable notice and hearing, and where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had at law or in equity in the courts of such State.\"\n\n Section 3906, Revised Codes of Montana 1921:\n'Any party in interest being dissatisfied with an order of the commission fixing any rate or rates, fares, charges, classifications, joint rate or rates, or any order fixing any regulations, practices, or services, may within ninety days commence an action in the district court of the proper county against the commission and other interested parties as defendants, to vacate and set aside any such order on the ground that the rate or rates, fares, charges, classifications, joint rate or rates, fixed in such order is unlawful or unreasonable, or that any such regulation, practice, or service, fixed in such order, is unlawful or unreasonable. ...\n\n'No injunction shall issue suspending or staying any order of the commission except upon application to the court or judge thereof, notice to the commission having been first given and hearing having been had thereon; provided, that all rates fixed by the commission shall be deemed reasonable and just, and shall remain in full force and effect until final determination by the courts having jurisdiction.'\n\n Appellees maintain that under Porter v. Investors' Syndicate, \n286 \nU.S. 461\n, 52 S.Ct. 617, the inhibition of the Montana statute, against stay or injunction prior to final determination, plainly conflicts with the Federal Constitution and should be disregarded. Further, that when this is eliminated there are other statutory provisions which per- \n\n[299 U.S. 167, 170]\n\u00a0\n mit the state courts to issue appropriate preliminary relief. Following Montana Power Co. v. Public Service Commission et al. (D.C.) 12 F.Supp. 946, the court below sustained this view.\n While the inhibition has not been definitely sustained by the Supreme Court of the State against an attack based upon unconstitutionality, it was recognized without suggestion of disapproval in Billings Utility Co. v. Public Service Commission et al., 62 Mont. 21, 32, 203 P. 366; State ex rel. Public Service Commission et al. v. Great Northern Utilities Co., 86 Mont. 442, 446, 284 P. 772. And see State ex rel. Board of Railroad Commissioners v. District Court et al., 53 Mont. 229, 233, 163 P. 115.\n Except for the Johnson Act, appellant's bills of complaint would state causes of action within the jurisdiction of the federal court. Obviously, also, the amendment relied upon has no application unless there is 'a plain, speedy and efficient remedy' in the state courts. And we cannot conclude that such remedy exists where, as here, a state statute definitely denying it has not been authoritatively condemned. In the circumstances it is impossible to know what position the courts of the State would take. A 'plain, speedy, and efficient remedy' cannot be predicated upon the problematical outcome of future consideration.\n Porter v. Investors' Syndicate, supra, is not controlling. Section 3906, Montana Codes, was not there in question. And, while the opinion may suggest reasons for challenging its validity, the Montana courts have not spoken; until they do we cannot treat the statute as nonexistent. The essential remedy in the state courts does not emerge from the probability that the statute expressly prohibiting it may hereafter be declared ineffective. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v.

WOOD(1936)\nNo. 70\nArgued: November 13, 1936Decided: December 7, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and James W.\nMorris, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioners.\n Mr. Ray M. Foreman, of Danville, Ill., for respondent. \n\n[299 U.S. 211, 212]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Decedent was an honorably discharged volunteer soldier of the Civil War. In 1904, he was allowed a pension. October 19, 1924, having made application and signed an agreement in accordance with the Act of June 25, 1910,1 he was enrolled as a member and admitted to the Danville branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers and continued to be an inmate until he died, September 16, 1926. During that period the United States paid his pension, in instalments of $72 per month, to the treasurer of the branch. He died intestate, leaving as his sole heir at law, a son over 21 years old. Respondent brought this action to recover $1,546.47 of his pension money remaining in the hands of the treasurer after deductions as to which no question has been raised. The District Court gave judgment for that amount with interest and costs. 9 F.Supp. 403. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed except as to costs. \n2\n 81 F.(2d) 963. That decision, being in conflict with one of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Durack v. National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, 44 F.(2d) 516, this Court granted a writ of certiorari.\n Petitioners raise a single question. They maintain that, since the decedent did not leave a widow, minor child or dependent mother or father, the accumulated pension fund became payable at his death to the post fund of the Danville branch. If the Act of July 1, 1902,3 governs, the balance belongs to the post fund. If, as held below, the act of 1910 and the agreement made in \n\n[299 U.S. 211, 213]\n\u00a0\n accordance with it control, the administrator is entitled to recover.\n Section 2 of the Act of February 26, 1881, provides: 'All pensions payable ... under this act, to pensioners who are inmates of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers shall be paid to the treasurer ... of said home ... to be disbursed for the benefit of the pensioners. ... Any balance of the pension which may remain at the date of the pensioner's discharge shall be paid over to him; and in case of his death at the home, the same shall be paid to the widow, or children or in default of either to his legal representatives.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Applicable to the pension money held by the branch were rules and regulations declaring: A pensioner, not classed as incompetent, may direct that all or any portion of his pension money be sent to his wife, minor child or dependent relative; the governor of a branch may prevent hurtful, wasteful, or extravagant use of the pension money by retaining a sufficient amount until the danger has passed; pension money standing to the credit of a member sick in hospital will be paid directly to him in such amounts only as are necessary for his personal use; in the case of members classed as incompetent, payment of pension money may be made as follows: (a) To the surgeon in such sums as may be \n\n[299 U.S. 211, 214]\n\u00a0\n necessary for the personal expenses of the member; (b) to a wife, minor child or dependent relative upon the authority of the president of the board of managers; (c) to pay taxes, etc., when necessary to protect the interests of the members. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Act of July 1, 1902, provides: 'Hereafter any balance of pension money due a member of the National Home ... at the time of his death shall be paid to his widow, minor children or dependent mother or father in the order named, and should' none 'be discovered within one year from the time of the death ... sayd balance shall be paid to the post fund of the Branch ... of which the pensioner was a member at the time of his death ... subject to future reclamation by the relatives hereinbefore designated, upon application filed ... within five years after the pensioner's death.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioners maintain, and for the purposes of this decision we assume without deciding, that the act of 1902 relates to pension money paid to the treasurer of a national home for the use and benefit of a member and held by him at the time of the member's death. But it contains nothing that relates to use or disposition of the fund while the pensioner is alive. It relates exclusively \n\n[299 U.S. 211, 215]\n\u00a0\n to disposition of the balance in the hands of the treasurer at the time of death. In that respect alone, it conflicts with and supersedes the corresponding provisions of the act of 1881\n\n\n The scope and effect of the Act of June 25, 1910, remains to be considered. It provides: 'Hereafter the application of any person for membership in the National Home ... and the admission of the applicant thereunder shall be and constitute a valid and binding contract between such applicant and the Board of Managers of said home that on the death of said applicant while a member ... leaving no heirs at law nor next of kin, all personal property owned by said applicant at the time of his death, including money or choses in action held by him and not disposed of by will, whether such property be the proceeds of pensions or otherwise derived, shall vest in and become the property of said Board ... for the sole use and benefit of the post find of said home ... and that all personal property of said applicant shall, upon his death, while a member, at once pass to and vest in said Board ... subject to be reclaimed by any legatee or person entitled to take the same by inheritance at any time within five years after the death of such member.'\n Before that enactment, it was disclosed that in the National Home a substantial number of inmates died interstate and without heirs, leaving not only the balance of their pension money remaining in the hands of the branch treasurer, but also money on deposit in banks. The act directs the disposition of personal property left by members dying intestate and without heirs. Congress intended to vest in the board of managers for the post fund only that which, for lack of testamentary disposition and heirs at law, would be liable to escheat to the state. Whether the act extends to the balance of decedent's pension money accumulated in the hands of the branch \n\n[299 U.S. 211, 216]\n\u00a0\n treasurer depends upon the meaning to be given to the words 'all personal property owned by said applicant at the time of his death, including money or choses in action held by him and not disposed of by will, whether such property be the proceeds of pensions or otherwise derived.' The words 'all personal property' are board enough to include his beneficial interest in the trust fund created by payments of his pension to the treasurer. The words 'including money or choses in action' obviously do not exclude that money. There is nothing to suggest that the phrase 'whether such property be the proceeds of pensions or otherwise derived' was intended to eliminate the pension money. It indicates purpose to extend not to restrict. Even if 'proceeds of pensions' might be held to refer to something other than pension money, that meaning would have no tendency to exclude funds in the hands of the treasurer. The measure leaves the member free to dispose by will and safeguards to the legatees and heirs the right within five years to reclaim all the property that belonged to him at the time of his death. As to that, there is no ambiguity and therefore nothing to construe. To the extent that, in respect of disposition of the pension money in the hands of the treasurer at the time of the member's death, the act of 1910 is inconsistent with the act of 1902, the latter is superseded. It follows that respondent is entitled to the fund in question.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 36 Stat. 736,  1, 24 U.S.C.  136 (24 U.S.C.A.  136). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Circuit Court of Appeals held: Although governmental agencies are named defendants, the suit is in fact one against the United States.

The consideration was a semiannual premium of $38 payable during his life, but for not more than twenty years. If, however, the insured became totally and permanently disabled before the age of sixty, the company, petitioner, was to pay him a monthly income at an agreed rate and was to waive the payment of any premium that would otherwise be due. Disability was to be considered total when the insured was so affected by bodily injury or disease as to be wholly prevented from performing any work, from following any occupation, or from engaging in any business for remuneration or profit. In particular, 'the total and irrecoverable loss of the sight of both eyes or of the use of both hands or of both feet or of one hand and one foot' was to constitute 'total disability for life.' Before making any income payment or waiving any premium, the company might demand due proof of the continuance of total disability, not oftener, however, than once a year after such disability had continued for two full years. Upon failure to furnish such proof, or if the insured performed any work, or followed any occupation, or engaged in any business for remuneration or profit, 'no further income payments' were to be made, 'nor premiums waived.' If, at the time of a default in the payment of a premium, the insured was disabled within the definition of the policy, the insurance was to be reinstated, provided, however, that within six months after the default proofs of such disability were received by the insurer. In any event, reinstatement would be permitted at any time within five years upon evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer and upon payment of overdue premiums with interest at 5 per cent. Finally, the insured, though in default, was to have the benefit of surrender values in the form either of cash or of tem- \n\n[297 U.S. 672, 675]\n\u00a0\n porary insurance or of participating paid-up insurance according to his choice.\n On September 11, 1931, the insured, according to the declaration, lost 'the total and irrecoverable use' of one hand and one foot, and became totally and permanently disabled. Upon proof of his condition the company paid him the monthly benefits called for by the policy from October 11, 1931, to July 11, 1933, and during the same period waived the payment of semiannual premiums. It refused to make a monthly payment in August, 1933, and refused the same month to waive a semiannual premium, 'asserting to the plaintiff as its ground for such refusal that since it appeared to the defendant that for some time past the plaintiff had not been continuously totally disabled within the meaning of the disability benefit provision of the policy, the defendant would make no further monthly disability payments, and that the premiums due on and after August 7, 1933, would be payable in conformity with the terms of the contract.' Later, upon the expiration of a term of grace, 'the defendant, on or about September 19, 1933, declared the policy as lapsed upon its records.' Plaintiff has elected to treat the defendant's acts 'as a repudiation and denunciation of the entire contract,' relieving him on his part from any further obligation.\n There are two counts to his declaration. In the first, after stating the foregoing facts, he claims the cash surrender value that the policy will have in February, 1969, if he lives until that time, the date being chosen with reference to his expectancy of life under the American Table of Mortality. This value, $1,408, is less than the amount necessary to give jurisdiction in accordance with the Judicial Code. Judicial Code,  24, 28 U.S.C.  41, 28 U.S.C.A.  41. In the second count, after stating the same facts, he claims for damages the total benefits that will be payable to him during the same period of expectancy, if he \n\n[297 U.S. 672, 676]\n\u00a0\n lives that long and his disability continues. The damages so computed are $ 15,900. No deduction is made on account of future premiums, for by hypothesis the disability will continue during life. The defendant demurred to both counts, stating in the demurrer that the declaration sets forth a cause of action for the benefits and premiums accruing prior to the date of the writ, and for nothing in excess thereof. In that view the recovery will be only $98, which is less than the jurisdictional amount. The District Court sustained the demurrer, and gave judgment for the defendant. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed. 78 F.(2d) 829. A writ of certiorari issued to resolve a claim of conflict with a decision of this court. \n296 \nU.S. 571\n, 56 S.Ct. 370.\n Upon the showing made in the complaint there was neither a repudiation of the policy nor such a breach of its provisions as to make conditional and future benefits the measure of recovery.\n Repudiation there was none as the term is known to the law. Petitioner did not disclaim the intention or the duty to shape its conduct in accordance with the provisions of the contract. Far from repudiating those provisions, it appealed to their authority and endeavored to apply them. If the insured was still disabled, monthly benefits were payable, and there should have been a waiver of the premium. If he had recovered the use of hand or foot and was not otherwise disabled, his right to benefits had ceased, and the payment of the premium was again a contractual condition. There is nothing to show that the insurer was not acting in good faith in giving notice of its contention that the disability was over. Mobley v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n295 \nU.S. 632, 638\n, 55 S.Ct. 876, 99 A.L.R. 1166. If it made a mistake, there was a breach of a provision of the policy with liability for any damages appropriate thereto. We do not pause at the moment to fix the proper measure. Enough in this connection that at \n\n[297 U.S. 672, 677]\n\u00a0\n that stage of the transaction there had been no renunciation or abandonment of the contract as a whole. Mobley v. New York Life Insurance Co., supra; Dingley v. Oler, \n117 \nU.S. 490, 503\n, 6 S.Ct. 850; Roehm v. Horst, \n178 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 15 S., 20 S.Ct. 780; Pierce v. Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co., \n173 \nU.S. 1, 3\n, 11 S., 19 S.Ct. 335.\n Renunciation or abandonment, if not effected at that stage, became consummate in the plaintiff's view at the end of the period of grace when the company declared the policy 'lapsed upon its records.' Throughout the plaintiff's argument the declaration of a lapse is treated as equivalent to a declaration that the contract is a nullity. But the two are widely different under such a policy as this. \n1\n The policy survived for many purposes as an enforceable obligation, though default in the payment of premiums had brought about a change of rights and liabil ties. The insurer was still subject to a duty to give the insured the benefit of the stipulated surrender privileges, cash or new insurance. It was still subject to a duty upon proof within six months that the disability continued to reinstate the policy as if no default had occurred. None of these duties was renounced. None of them was questioned. Indeed, there is lacking an allegation that notice of the entry on the records was given to the plaintiff, or that what was recorded amounted to more than a private memorandum. In that respect the case is weaker for the plaintiff than Mobley v. New York Life Insurance Co., supra, decided at the last term. There also the controversy turned upon the rejection of a claim of disability under a like contract of insurance. The insurer took the ground that the disability had ended and that premiums would not be waived. Upon default it gave notice to the insured that the policy \n\n[297 U.S. 672, 678]\n\u00a0\n had lapsed. We held that the breach fell short of an unconditional abandonment. On the other hand, following the notice and before the service of a summons, there were acts and declarations pointing to an understanding between insurer and insured that the lapse was not definitive but was open to recall. These differences are such as to take from that decision the quality of a controlling precedent, though the analogy it offers is cogent and persuasive. Viewing the case before us independently, we hold that upon the facts declared in the complaint the insurer did not repudiate the obligation of the contract, but did commit a breach for which it is answerable in damages.\n What the damages would be if there had been complete repudiation we do not now decide. Cf. Kelly v. Security Mutual Life Insurance Co., 186 N. Y. 16, 78 N.E. 584, 9 Ann.Cas. 661; O'Neill v. Supreme Council, A.L. of H., 70 N.J.Law, 410, 415, 57 A. 463, 1 Ann.Cas. 422. For breach short of repudiation or an intentional abandonment equivalent thereto, the damages under such a policy as this do not exceed the benefits in default at the commencement of the suit. Full justice will thus be done alike to insured and to insurer. The insured, if he proves that the benefits are due, will have a judgment effective to reinstate his policy. The insurer will be saved from a heavy, perhaps a crushing, liability as the consequence of a claim of right not charged to have been made as a disingenuous pretense. Cf. Armstrong v. Ross, 61 W.Va. 38, 48, 55 S.E. 895. So the courts have held with an impressive concord of opinion. 2 Federal Life Insurance Co. v. Rascoe (C.C.A.) 12 F. \n\n[297 U.S. 672, 679]\n\u00a0\n (2d) 693, one of the few decisions to the contrary, was disapproved in Mobley's Case, \n295 U.S. 632\n, at page 639, 55 S.Ct. 876, 878, 99 A.L.R. 1166, and is now disapproved again.\n We have no thought to suggest an invariable rule whereby the full value of a bargain may never be recovered for any breach of contract falling short of repudiation or intentional abandonment. All depends upon the circumstances. Helgar Corporation v. Warner's Features, Inc., 222 N.Y. 449, 452, 453, 454, 119 N.E. 113.3 There may be times when justice requires that, irrespective of repudiation or abandonment, the sufferer from the breach shall be relieved of a duty to treat the contract as subsisting or to hold himself in readiness to perform it in the future. Roehm v. Horst, supra, \n178 U.S. 1\n, at pages 17, 18, 20 S.Ct. 780; Nichols v. Scranton Steel Co., 137 N.Y. 471, 487, 33 N.E. 561. Generally this is so where the contract is \n\n[297 U.S. 672, 680]\n\u00a0\n a bilateral one with continuing obligations, as where a manufacturer has undertaken to deliver merchandise in instalments. Norrington v. Wright, \n115 \nU.S. 188\n, 6 S.Ct. 12; Wolfert v. Caledonia Springs Ice Co., 195 N.Y. 118, 88 N.E. 24, 21 L.R.A.(N.S.) 864. Even then, the rights that are his may depend upon the grounds of the rejection or the nature of the default, whether unintentional or wilful. Helgar Corporation v. Warner's Features, Inc., supra. On the other hand, a party to a contract who has no longer any obligation of performance on his side, but is in the position of an annuitant or a creditor exacting payment from a debtor, may be compelled to wait for the instalments as they severally mature, just as a landlord may not accelerate the rent for the residue of the term because the rent is in default for a month or for a year. McCready v. Lindenborn, 172 N.Y. 400, 408, 65 N.E. 208; cf. National Machine & Tool Co. v. Standard Shoe Machinery Co., 181 Mass. 275, 279, 63 N.E. 900; Wharton & Co. v. Winch, 140 N.Y. 287, 35 N.E. 589. With the aid of this analysis, one discovers the rationale of the cases which have stated at times, though with needless generality, that by reason of the subject-matter of the undertaking the rule applicable to contracts for the payment of money is not the same as that applicable for the performance of services or the delivery of merchandise. Cf. Roehm v. Horst, supra, \n178 U.S. 1\n, at page 17, 20 S.Ct. 780; Moore v. Security Trust & Life Insurance Co. ( C.C.A.) 168 F. 496, 503; Howard v. Benefit Association of Railway Employees, 239 Ky. 465, 470, 39 S.W.(2d) 657, 81 A.L.R. 375; Washington County v. Williams (C.C.A.) 111 F. 801, 810; Restatement, Law of Contracts ,  316. The root of any valid distinction is not in the difference between money and merchandise or between money and services. What counts decisively is the relation between the maintenance of the contract and the frustration of the ends it was expected to subserve. \n\n[297 U.S. 672, 681]\n\u00a0\n The ascertainment of this relation calls for something more than the mechanical application of a uniform formula. To determine whether a breach avoids the contract as a whole one must consider what is necessary to work out reparation in varying conditions.\n If that test be applied, the declaration will not stand. The plaintiff does not need redress in respect of unmatured instalments in order to put himself in a position to shape his conduct for the future. If he is already in default for the nonpayment of a premium, he will not be in any worse predicament by multiplying the defa lts thereafter. On the other hand, if his default is unreal because the premiums had been waived, the insurer will be estopped from insisting upon later premiums until the declaration of a lapse has been canceled or withdrawn. Besides, if the disability is permanent, there will be nothing more to pay. The law will be able to offer appropriate relief 'where compensation is willfully and contumaciously withheld.' Cobb v. Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. (Cal. Sup.) 51 P.(2d) 84, 88.\n We have refrained in what has been written from developing the distinction between an anticipatory breach and others. The line of division between the two has not always been preserved with consistency or clearness. To blur it is prejudicial to accuracy of thought as well as precision of terminology. Strictly an anticipatory breach is one committed before the time has come when there is a present duty of performance. Roehm v. Horst, supra; Pollock on Contracts (9th Ed.) p. 293; Williston, Contracts, vol. 3,  1296, et seq., collecting the decisions. It is the outcome of words or acts evincing an intention to refuse performance in the future. On the other hand, there are times, as we have seen, when the breach of a present duty, though only partial in its extension, may confer upon the injured party the privilege at his election \n\n[297 U.S. 672, 682]\n\u00a0\n to deal with the contract as if broken altogether. A loose practice has been growing up whereby the breach on such occasions is spoken of as anticipatory, whereas in truth it is strictly present, though with consequences effective upon performance in the future. The declaration in the case at hand makes a showing of a present breach. It does not make a showing of a breach so wilful and material as to make acceleration of future benefits essential to the attainment of present reparation. Helgar Corporation v. Warner's Features, Inc., supra.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See the cases collected in Vance on Insurance (2d Ed.) pp. 283, 301, 302. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Daley v.

OKLAHOMA CITY(1936)\nNo. 335\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 481, 482]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles H. Garnett, of Oklahoma City, Okl., Warren E. Libby, of Los Angeles, Cal., and Joe T. Rogers, of Wichita, Kan., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Harlan Deupree and W. H. Brown, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These were actions in ejectment tried in a state court. The petitioners in No. 335 sued as the heirs of Naoma Noble, the petitioners in No. 336 as the heirs of Robert W. Higgins. Title to a town lot and a portion of another parcel of land located in the respondent city was in dispute.\n The tracts formerly were part of the tribal lands of the Creek Indians. Pursuant to treaties the Creeks removed from east of the Mississippi river to a large area in Indian Territory, now in the State of Oklahoma,1 and a patent was issued by the President of the United States, granting them the lands 'to have and to hold ... so long as they shall exist as a Nation and continue to occupy the Country hereby conveyed to them.' \n2\n By the Treaty of Washington3 the tribe ceded to the United States the western half of their domain, which included the site of what is now Oklahoma City, in trust, to be sold and used as homes for civilized Indians whom the United States might desire to settle thereon. This and a prior treaty vested in Congress power to grant railroad rights of way through the Creek country. The United \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 483]\n\u00a0\n States did not sell any portion of the ceded area to Indians or permit white settlement in the region of Oklahoma City and the land remained vacant.\n By Act of February 18, 1888,4 Congress authorized the Choctaw Coal & Railway Company to locate and construct a railroad traversing the southeastern portion of the Indian Territory, through lands of the Choctaw Nation whose title was similar to that of the Creek Nation. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The President, on January 19, 1889, negotiated a treaty with the Creeks6 by which they ceded to the United States full and complete title to the entire western half of their lands, thus freeing the area from the trust under which it had theretofore been held. This treaty was subject to ratification by the council of the tribe and by Congress. It was confirmed by the former January 31, 1889\n\n\n Pending the ratification of the treaty, Congress, on February 13, 1889, amended the Act of February 18, 1888, to authorize the railway company to construct a branch extending from its main line northwest- wardly through Choctaw and Creek country. \n7\n The road so authorized now traverses Oklahoma City. The Creek Tribe then owned the eastern portion of the Creek country through which the branch line was to run, and retained an interest in the western portion. March 1, 1889, Congress ratified the treaty of January 19, 1889, and, in the act of ratification, provided that 'the lands acquired by the United States under said agreement shall be a part of the public domain.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n By Act of March 2, 1889,9 Congress directed that the lands acquired from the Creek Nation should be disposed \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 484]\n\u00a0\n of to actual settlers under the homestead laws but that no person should be permitted to enter thereon until the territory was opened for settlement. The release, conveyance, and extinguishment of the Indians' rights was not to inure 'to the benefit of or cause to vest in any railroad company any right, title, or interest whatever in or to any of said lands ... and all grants or pretended grants of said lands or any interest or right therein now existing in or on behalf of any railroad company, except rights of way and depot grounds,' were declared forfeited for breach of condition.\n March 23, 1889, the President issued a proclamation opening a portion of the lands to settlement at noon April 22, 1889. Before the latter date the railway company had surveyed the line of its proposed railroad through what is now Oklahoma City and market it by stakes along the center line of the right of way and by signs warning that the land was claimed for right of way and station purposes. It appears to have been then known that a townsite would be laid out on the quarter-section in which the Noble tract is located. Prior to the opening of the land a plat had been made and, at 12 o'clock, April 22, 1889, surveyors began to run lines and drive stakes to locate the lots and blocks of the townsite. On that day many settlers, amongst whom was Naoma Noble, arrived and staked and occupied lots. As the survey proceeded they adjusted their claims and boundaries to the survey lines. In surveying and staking out lots both the surveyors and the ancestor of the petitioners in No. 335 disregarded the right of way marks. All the lots in the original townsite, comprising the quarter-section in which the Noble land is situated, were occupied on the da of opening. On the same day Robert C. Higgins, the ancestor through whom the petitioners in No. 336 claim, settled upon the quarter-section adjoining the \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 485]\n\u00a0\n townsite on the west, and undertook to file a homestead entry thereon.\n July 13, 1889, the railway company filed with the Secretary of the Interior a map of definite location of its line as staked out through Oklahoma City. The road ran diagonally through the town site quarter- section, included the whole of the Noble lot, and traversed diagonally Higgins' adjoining quarter-section.\n The Act of May 2, 1890,10 organizing the territory of Oklahoma, provided that: 'No part of the land embraced within the Territory hereby created shall inure to the use or benefit of any railroad corporation, except the rights of way and land for stations heretofore granted to certain railroad corporations. Nor shall any provision of this act or any act of any officer of the United States, done or performed under the provisions of this act or otherwise, invest any corporation owning or operating any railroad in the Indian Territory, or Territory created by this act, with any land or right to any land in either of said Territories, and this act shall not apply to or affect any land which, upon any condition on becoming a part of the public domain, would inure to the benefit of, or become the property of, any railroad corporation.' Not until May 14, 1890,11 did Congress pass a townsite act applicable to Oklahoma. In the meantime, the citizens had established a form of government and elected officials. A plan of the townsite was filed in the office of the city recorder and provision made by ordinance for recording transfers of the plotted property. The recorder issued certificates to the occupants of lots and transfers were made by quitclaim deeds. After the passage of the townsite act trustees were appointed and the entire quarter- section constituting the original townsite was patented to the trustees \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 486]\n\u00a0\n without exception, limitation, or reservation. In due time the trustees issued their deeds for the various lots, including the Noble tract.\n From 1889 to 1893 the railway company and the lot claimants were in disagreement, the former contending that the acts of Congress vested it with title to the right of way, the latter insisting that their occupation before the filing of the company's plot with the Secretary of the Interior gave them the superior title. The dispute was amicably settled by the company's relinquishing its claim to the diagonal 300-foot right of way as plotted, and relocating it, 100 feet wide, parallel to the streets and alleys shown on the city plan. The lots or portions of lots required for the relocation were obtained from the owners by deeds or condemnation. March 28, 1891, Naoma and George Noble executed a deed to the railway company containing the following clause: 'Being intended for the use and occupation of said party (grantee), its successors and assigns, as and for its right-of-way for the constructing, operation and maintenance of its railroad and business at or upon the land hereby released and quit claimed: Provided, that in case of abandonment of said premises by said second party, its successors or assigns for the purposes above mentioned, the same shall revert to the grantors, their heirs or assigns.'\n The right of Higgins to make a homestead entry being involved in a land office contest the company constructed its road across his quarter- section and was operating trains thereover in 1892. After the contest eventuated in his favor he conveyed to the railroad, in 1898, for a pecuniary consideration, a strip of land 100 feet wide across his quarter- section 'for a right of way for its railroad, Telegraph and Telephone Lines, and for Railroad or Station purposes.' The habendum clause was: \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 487]\n\u00a0\n 'To have and to hold the same by the said Choctaw Oklahoma and Gulf R ilroad Company, together with all and singular the rights, privileges and appurtenances thereunto belonging and all the rights and privileges which said company is authorized to have, hold and exercise under and by virtue of the Act of Congress granting the Choctaw Coal and Railway Company a right of way through the Indian Territory, approved February 18th, 1888, and subsequent Acts of Congress amending and extending said Act together with all the rights and privileges granted unto said Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad Company by an Act of Congress approved August 24th, 1894, and the Act of Congress approved April 24th, 1896, and unto its successors, and assigns forever.'\n The road constructed on the right of way so acquired in Oklahoma City was operated by the railway and its successors until December 4, 1930. Pursuant to an agreement made with the city, the then owner and operator secured the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission of the abandonment of the line, 12 and executed a quitclaim deed to the city for the abandoned portion. A decree was obtained from the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma adjudging that the land had been abandoned for railroad purposes and that the company's title had passed to the city under an Act of Congress of March 8, 1922.13 None \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 488]\n\u00a0\n of the petitioners was a party to this proceeding. The city took possession and has since held the strip. These suits were filed shortly thereafter. Petitioners asserted that the Act of February 18, 1888, and the amending Act of February 13, 1889, made no grant in praesenti of a right of way but merely authorized the company to acquire one by purchase or condemnation; that these statutes applied only to Indian country and not to the public domain; and that on February 13, 1889, the land in question was Creek Indian land and the only title the company acquired to its right of way, so far as the tracts in controversy are concerned, was that conveyed by the deeds of petitioners' ancestors under both of which the title, on abandonment for railroad purposes, reverted to their heirs and assigns. The defense to this claim was that the acts presently invested the railway with title to the right of way subsequently located, obtained, and used, which, upon abandonment of the use, reverted to the United States and was, by the Act of March 8, 1922, conveyed to the respondent.\n Petitioners further urged that, even if the acts of Congress operated as grants in praesenti, the estate of the \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 489]\n\u00a0\n company endured only so long as the land was devoted to railroad use, with a right of reverter, either vested in the Creek Tribe and conveyed to the United States by the cession effective March 1, 1889, or vested directly in the United States; and the right of reverter passed from the United States by patent to the petitioners' ancestors and from them, by deed and inheritance, to the respective petitioners. Upon the extinguishment of the railroad's estate by abandonment, full title, so they claimed, reverted to them. They alleged the Act of March 8, 1922, does not apply in the circumstances and, if held applicable, is unconstitutional as depriving them of property without due process.\n The trial court entered judgments in favor of the city and, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma consolidated the cases for hearing and affirmed the judgments. \n14\n In their applications for certiorari the petitioners asserted that the state court's construction of the acts of 1888 and 1889 conflicts with the decision of a federal court in respect of an act identical in terms,15 and stressed the importance of a final adjudication as affecting not only their titles but many others in Oklahoma City, the subject of threatened suits in state and federal courts. On this showing the writ was granted.\n First. The Act of February 18, 1888, does not purport to grant lands for right of way and station purposes. The title is 'An act to authorize the Choctaw Coal and Railway Company to construct and operate a railway through the Indian Territory.' By the first section the company is 'invested and empowered with the right of locating, constructing, owning, equipping, operating, using, and maintaining a railway.' Section 2 provides that the corporation 'is authorized to take and use' for railway, but \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 490]\n\u00a0\n for no other purpose, a right of way and 'to take and use' land for station purposes. Section 3 requires that, before the road shall be constructed through land held by any individual occupant according to Indian usage, full compensation must be made to the occupant, prescribes the method of securing compensation, and creates a tribunal for ascertaining and awarding it, from whose decision a right of appeal to a federal court is given. Section 5 lays on the company the obligation to pay to any tribe through whose unallotted lands the line may run a fixed compensation per mile. If the tribe be dissatisfied with the amount specified in the act, the just measure of compensation is to be ascertained by the same procedure as is directed in the case of an individual allottee. The company is permitted to survey and locate its railway immediately; and, by section 6, is required to cause maps, showing the location of its lines, to be filed with the Secretary of the Interior and with the chiefs of the nations or tribes through whose lands they run. The section adds: 'After the filing of said maps no claim for a subsequent settlement and improvement upon the right of way shown by said maps shall be valid as against said company.' The Secretary of the Interior is to approve of the location before any construction may be begun. Section 13 enacts: 'The right of way herein and hereby granted shall not be assigned or transferred in any form whatever prior to the construction and completion of the road.' Except for the words just quoted from section 13 upon which respondent relies, the act plainly grants an authority or a franchise rather than physical property. The expression used in that section is not sufficient to enlarge the limited scope of the act disclosed by the enacting sections.\n The respondent, and the court below, refer to decisions holding certain right of w y acts to be grants in praesenti, but those acts not only affect the public lands of the United States which are subject to unrestricted disposition \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 491]\n\u00a0\n by the government,16 but explicitly state that 'a right of way is hereby granted.' \n17\n\u00a0\n\n The act of 1888, considered in its entirety, evinces the intent that the company is to compensate for all lands taken for its use, whether those of individual allottees or of the tribe. No provision for compensation to white settlers was made because at the date of the passage of the statutes none were permitted within the area to be traversed by the railroad. The acts in question were construed by Assistant Attorney General (now Mr. Justice) Van Devanter in an opinion rendered to the Department of the Interior in 1898, 18 as not making grants in praesenti, but conferring only the right to locate a railroad and take the necessary land upon making just compensation to its owners or those having an inchoate right of ownership. A similar conclusion was announced by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit19 in respect of the act authorizing the building of the Fort Smith & Western Railroad,20 which is identical with that under review except for the name of the company and the termini of the projected railroad.\n Later statutes respecting the railroad are said to support respondent's view of the nature of the original grant. We think, however, the subsequent legislation is, at best, of doubtful aid in the construction of the act of 1888. The Act of February 13, 1889 (25 Stat. 668), amended section 1 of the orig- \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 492]\n\u00a0\n inal act by authorizing the construction of the branch line extending westwardly and northwestwardly from the main line, which branch now runs through the respondent city. It made no other alteration in the provisions of the earlier legislation. The Acts of February 21, 1891,21 and January 22, 1894,22 extended the time originally granted for constructing the railroad. The latter act added: 'And for such purpose the said company shall have the right to take and occupy the right of way and depot grounds heretofore granted to it by said Acts.' We think, in the light of the clear provisions of the original authorization, no inference favorable to the respondent's contention is to be drawn from this phrase in the extending act.\n On the other hand, Congress has indicated its view that the original act merely authorized the exercise of the right of eminent domain. By the Act of August 24, 1894,23 the creditors and stockholders of the railway, which had become insolvent, were reorganized into a new corporation, the Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad Company. Section 4 provides: 'That it shall and may be lawful for such new corporation to construct and operate branches from its said railroad and for such purpose to take and use rights of way ... upon making compensation therefor as provided in the case of taking land for its main line.'\n Respondent also cites a portion of section 18 of the O ganic Act for the Territory of Oklahoma quoted supra to support the claim that by the act of 1888 Congress intended to grant in praesenti. For the same purpose the court below quoted and relied on one sentence found in the section. We think, however, that the provision was \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 493]\n\u00a0\n merely intended to preserve the status quo and does not aid in the construction of previous legislation respecting the rights of railroads in the territory.\n Were the act of 1888 of doubtful import the conditions existing when it and the amending act of 1889 were adopted would be conclusive of the legislative intent. The main line authorized by the first act ran for the greater portion through the lands of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians. The title of these tribes was substantially similar to that of the Creeks and while, in the treaty by which their title was confirmed, there was provision that rights of way for railroads might be granted through their territory, the condition was added that full compensation should be made for any property taken or destroyed in the construction of any such road. The branch line authorized by the act of 1889 extended westward through the eastern portion of the Creek lands which was unaffected by the treaty of 1866. The treaty of 1856 with this tribe contained a provision similar to that found in the Choctaw Treaty securing compensation for lands taken for railroad rights of way. The branch line also was to traverse the western portion of the Creek Nation's territory but, at the time the branch was authorized (February 13, 1889), that area was not public land of the United States and was held in trust for the settlement of other Indians. The restriction was not removed until March 1, 1889, at which time these lands were declared to be part of the public domain and intended for white settlement.\n Both the original and the amending act contemplated that the right of way would run through lands owned by Indian tribes or claimed by Indian allottees and none other. In view of the nature of the title of the Indians, we cannot impute to the Congress a purpose by the act of 1888 to grant any portion of the lands to the company or to impose a servitude without compensation. \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 494]\n\u00a0\n For these reasons we are unable to agree with the construction of the act by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in the present case and in earlier decisions. 24 We hold the legislation granted a franchise, authorized a taking upon compensation secured or made, and was not a grant of land.\n Second. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the act of 1888 granted the railroad a base or limited fee, as does the general railroad act of March 3, 1875,25 we think the marked similarity of this special act to the general statute requires that they be given the same construction. It is well settled that the title to right of way and station lands conferred by the general railroad act does not accrue to the company until a map of definite location is filed with the Secretary of the Interior for his approval, or the road is actually constructed, and the rights of one claiming by settlement or occupancy antedating such filing or construction, are superior to those of the railroad. 26 Like the general railroad law, the act in question required the filing of plats of the location of the line for the Secretary's approval and, in addition, expressly subordinated to the railroad's rights any claim based on a settlement subsequent to such filing. This was a clear recognition of the principle applied to rights of way acquired pursuant to the general law, which was that the staking of a location of the proposed line was ineffectual to prevent the acquirement of rights by settlers and occupants under the homestead and town site laws. \n27\n It is not to be supposed that a different rule was \n\n[297 U.S. 481, 495]\n\u00a0\n intended by the act of 1888. The petitioners entered pon their tracts April 22, 1889. The company's map was not filed with the Secretary of the Interior until July 13th of the same year. Whatever the quality of the statutory grant to the railroad company, its rights had their inception after the assertion of, and were inferior to, those of the petitioners' ancestors.\n Third. It follows from what has been said that the railroad derived title to the Noble lot by the deed of Naoma and George Noble of March 28, 1891. As no question is made but that the reverter clause in that deed became operative upon abandonment of the line, the Noble title is superior to that of the respondent. It is equally true that when Higgins made his deed to the railroad company in 1898 he had good title to the premises conveyed and by that conveyance the railroad obtained whatever estate it had. The petitioners insist that the habendum clause in the deed operated to clothe them with full title on abandonment of the right of way. They say that the Supreme Court of Oklahoma so held. The opinion seems to proceed on this assumption, but in the view the court took, a decision of the question was unnecessary, and we find no direct ruling upon the point. We express no opinion as to the effect of the habendum clause, since this is a question of state law and appropriately may be decided by the state court.\n The grounds stated for our decision make it unnecessary to consider or to decide the other questions raised by the petitioners. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma must be reversed and the causes remanded to that Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Stat. 366; 7 Stat. 417; 11 Stat. 699. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Vol. 4 of Indian Deeds, in the Office of Indian Affairs, pp. 446, 447. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] June 14, 1866, 14 Stat. 785. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 25 Stat. 35. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Treaty of June 22, 1855, 11 Stat. 611. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 25 Stat. 757. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] 25 Stat. 668. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] 25 Stat. 757, 759,  2. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] 25 Stat. 980, 1004, 1005,  12. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] 26 Stat. 81, 89, 91,  18 (43 U.S.C.A.  1091). \n[\nFootnote 11\n] 26 Stat. 109 (43 U.S.C.A.  1111 et seq.). \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The railway was reorganized as Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad Company and the reorganized company given the same rights as its predecessor. 28 Stat. 502; 29 Stat. 98.

STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA(1936)\nNo. 610\nArgued: March 6, 1936Decided: March 30, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of North Carolina. \n\n[297 U.S. 682, 683]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. M. Rivinus, of Roanoke, Va., for appellant.\n Mr. A. A. F. Seawell, of Raleigh, N.C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether a statute of North Carolina laying a tax upon the net income of interstate railway companies has been so applied to the appellant as to violate the prohibitions of the Constitution of the United States.\n The Norfolk & Western Railway Company, a Virginia corporation, has lines of railway in North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. Its lines in North Carolina are branches, connecting with the main line at Roanoke, Lynchburg, and Abingdon, and running from those points of junction to Winston-Salem, Durham, and Elkland. For the years 1927, 1928, and 1929, it made return to the Commissioner of Revenue of North Carolina that it had no taxable income. The commissioner notified the company that the returns were erroneous, and made reassessments as follows: For 1927, $29,727.04; for 1928, $27,481.57; and for 1929, $29,213. 10; in all $86,421.71. The amount so fixed was paid, and this suit was brought in accordance with an applicable statute to recover back the payment. The superior court of Wake county, refusing to confirm the report of \n\n[297 U.S. 682, 684]\n\u00a0\n a referee in favor of the taxpayer, gave judgment for the state. The Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed (Maxwell v. Norfolk & Western R. Co., 208 N.C. 397, 181 S.E. 248); and the case is here upon appeal. Judicial Code,  237, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 U.S.C.A.  344).\n The net income of interstate railways doing business in North Carolina is taxed in accordance with the following formula (Public Laws 1927, c. 80,  312; Public Laws 1929, c. 345,  312): 'And when their business is in part within and in part without the State, their net income within this State shall be ascertained by taking their gross 'operating revenues' within this State, including in their gross 'operating revenues' within this State, the equal mileage proportion within this State of their interstate business, and deducting from their gross 'operating revenues' the proportionate average of 'operating expenses' or 'operating ratio' for their whole business, as shown by the Interstate Commerce Commission standard classification of accounts.' The formula thus adopted is not void upon its face. Pittsburgh, C.C. & St. Louis R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421, 430\n, 431 S., 14 S.Ct. 1114; State Railroad Tax Cases, \n92 \nU.S. 575, 608\n, 611 S.; Louisville Board of Trade v. Indianapolis, C . & S. Traction Co., 34 I.C.C. 640, 642; Low Moor Iron Co. of Va. v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 42 I.C.C. 221, 227; cf. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Doughton, \n262 \nU.S. 413\n, 43 S.Ct. 620. A division of revenues and costs in accordance with state lines can never be made for a unitary business with more than approximate correctness. There is a tendency, none the less, for rates to be so adjusted to expenses over different portions of a system as to produce, when averages are considered, a uniformity of net return, or a fair approach thereto.1 \n\n[297 U.S. 682, 685]\n\u00a0\n Thus mileage may have at times a relation to a tax upon net income which it may not bear to a property tax or even to one upon the value of a franchise. Cf. Rowley v. Chicago & N.W.R. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 102, 111\n, 55 S.Ct. 55; Wallace v. Hines, \n253 \nU.S. 66, 69\n, 40 S.Ct. 435. Taxpayer and state would be swamped with administrative difficulties if left to struggle through every case without the aid of a formula of ready application. In the perplexities besetting the process of assessment the statute is the outcome of a reasonable endeavor to arrive at a proportion of general validity. Pittsburgh, C.C. & St. Louis R. Co. v. Backus, supra. No contention to the contrary is made by the appellant. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n This is not to say that the tax is valid as imposed. A formula not arbitrary on its face or in its general operation may be unworkable or unfair when applied to a particular railway in particular conditions. Cf. Hans Rees' Sons v. North Carolina, \n283 \nU.S. 123, 129\n, 132 S., 51 S.Ct. 385; Southern Railway Co. v. Kentucky, \n274 \nU.S. 76, 83\n, 88 S., 47 S. Ct. 542. A segment of the line may operate under handicaps resulting from the nature of the traffic, the topography of the country, the maladjustment or inadequacy of passenger or freight tariffs in one district or another. As applied to such a segment the average mileage prorate of the entire railway system may be an arbitrary test of the relation between revenue and expenses. Cf. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Department of Public Works, \n268 \nU.S. 39, 44\n, 45 S.Ct. 412; Low Moor Iron Co. of Va. v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., supra. If this is made to appear with an ensuing burden on the taxpayer grossly in excess of the results of a more accurate apportionment, the statute to that extent \n\n[297 U.S. 682, 686]\n\u00a0\n is an unconstitutional endeavor to tax the income of a business in another jurisdiction. Hans Rees' Sons v. North Carolina, supra.\n Appellant now insists, as it insisted in the courts below, that the operating expenses for its North Carolina branches were far in excess of those allowed by the commissioner, who refused to depart from the statutory formula. There is evidence in the record giving support to that position, though its weight is contested by counsel for the state. If the evidence be accepted, the higher cost may be attributed to the mountainous terrain and the low density of traffic as well as to other causes which it is needless to develop. Up to that point the railway took upon itself the burden of making out a case for the rejection of the formula. There, however, it stopped, declining to g farther. From the testimony of its witnesses we learn that actual expenses were greater in North Carolina than the average expenses apportioned to that state on the basis of the ratio between state and system mileage. We learn nothing from these witnesses as to the ratio between revenues, average and actual. For all that appears in the case developed by the railway, actual gross revenues in North Carolina may have been so far in excess of average gross revenues computed under the statute as to neutralize the discrepancy between actual and average costs of operation. If such a counterbalance exists, appellant has not been injured through the application of the formula.\n The state took up the case where the railway put it down. Witnesses for the state maintain that through the application of the formula the gross revenues of operation are underestimated to a greater extent than operating costs. They tell us that the effect of the rejection of the formula will be to allocate to the state 159 per cent. of the revenues produced by applying it. In support of that conclusion they make elaborate studies and analyses, \n\n[297 U.S. 682, 687]\n\u00a0\n which are exhibits in the case. From their testimony it appears that the general level of rates in territory classified as Southern is higher than that in territory classified as Northern or 'Official.' Cf. Sloss- Sheffield Steel & Iron Co. v. Louisville & N.R. Co., 35 I.C.C. 460, 467; Corporation Commission v. Norfolk & Western R. Co., 19 I.C.C. 303, 311; Southern Class Rate Investigation, 100 I.C.C. 513, 520, 645, 671; Id., 109 I.C.C. 300, 324; Id., 113 I.C.C. 200; Id., 128 I.C.C. 567, 580. There is emphasis besides on a concession by the railway that the average system revenue per mile of line is only five times greater than that for the North Carolina branches, though the traffic density for the system is seven and a half times greater. Accountants for the railway criticize the studies and analyses with the accompanying computations as defective and misleading. They also take the position that there is no method of allocating revenues with any greater approach to certainty than by means of a mileage prorate. Whether for that reason or some other, they have not made an attempt to ascertain receipts, no matter how approximately, by any other method, as assuredly they would have tried to do if the statutory formula had been abolished altogether. By implication, if not expressly, the trial judge refused to yield assent to their position. Without finding the exact figures either for revenue or for expenses, he approved, at least in its main outline, the position of the state. 'The evidence seems persuasive that if the actual gross operating revenues should be determined, the amount returned by the defendant (i.e., the railway) would be increased by a much greater proportion than the operating expenses in North Carolina are increased over the operating expenses determined by the use of the statutory formula.' Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the state, this finding was approved. \n\n[297 U.S. 682, 688]\n\u00a0\n We are unable to accept the argument for the appellant that its burden was discharged when it gave evidence of the ratio between actual and average expenses while keeping silent as to the ratio between actual and average receipts. The statutory formula is not framed on an assumption that gross operating revenues are uniform actually for every mile throughout the system. It is not framed on an assumption that for every mile of the system there is uniformity of expense. Such assumptions, if made, would be contrary to notorious facts. What the formula does assume is this, that barring exceptional conditions there will be throughout the system such an average relation between revenues and expenses as will cause the net income of a part to vary, in proportion to the mileage, with the net income of the whole. The implications of the formula being what they are, a taxpayer does not escape the application of the statute by evidence directed to only one of the related terms. Its evidence to be effective must be directed to each of them alike, for only thus can the assumed relation between them be proved to be unreal. This taxpayer disclaims the duty and even the endeavor to respond to such a test. It varies the numerator of the fraction while accepting the denominator.\n A finding that the statute, though fair upon its face, is oppressive toward the railway in its practical operation cannot rest upon so fragmentary and partial a showing of facts. We must bear in mind steadily that the burden is on the taxpayer to make opperession manifest by clear and cogent evidence. Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 121\n, 41 S.Ct. 45; Maxwell v. Kent-Coffey Mfg. Co., 204 N.C. 365, 372, 374, 168 S.E. 397, 90a.L.R. 476; \n291 \nU.S. 642\n, 54 S.Ct. 437; Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd., v. State Tax Commission, \n266 \nU.S. 271, 280\n, 283 S., 45 S.Ct. 82. For 1927, it has had to pay a certain tax, for 1928 another, for 1929, another, a total of $86,421.71. Would it have had to pay less if \n\n[297 U.S. 682, 689]\n\u00a0\n net income had been ascertained without reference to mileage? Would the difference have been so great as to overpass the bounds of reason? In the evidence for the railway, there is no answer to those questions. On the other hand, the judge, who was the appointed trier of the facts, found the evidence for the state persuasive that the tax would have been as heavy and even heavier if the test of a mileage prorate had been excluded from the reckoning. The railway does not help its case greatly by its criticism of this evidence in one feature or another. The computations for the state may have been charged here and there with errors and omissions. They were not shattered so completely that the trier of the facts could not build on them at all. The criticisms too were not invulnerable, but were subject to the possibility of explanation or rejoinder. Indeed, apart from the computations, there was significance, if not compulsion, in facts admitted by the railway, though with the addition of many a gloss supposed to minimize their force. What weight should be ascribed to the whole composite mass was thus an inference of fact for the judge appointed to the task, and may not be disposed of here as an inference of law. All this becomes the plainer when we recall that the state in presenting computations did not lift the burden from the railway of satisfying the court, after all the evidence was in, that it was a victim of oppression. If different or supplementary computations were needful to that end, the railway, not the state, was under a duty to submit them.\n In what has been written we have assumed that revenue can be apportioned between one state and another by a method more accurate than by that of a mileage prorate, however useful such a formula may be in expressing a relation between revenue and expenses. The appellant denies, though, it seems, rather guardedly, that the possibility exists. Even so, the trier of the facts was \n\n[297 U.S. 682, 690]\n\u00a0\n at liberty to discredit the denial. There was impeachment of the denial in the evidence for the state. There was impeachment as effective in the failure of appellant to lay before the court such studies as its accountants could supply, figuring out a fair apportionment to the best of its ability and then appraising the results. Something more was to be expected in the way of genuine endeavor before a sweeping non possumus could be accepted as conclusive. We do not now determine how incapacity, if made out, would affect the application of the statutory formula. For present purposes it suffices that there is no such showing now.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Huang, State Taxation of Railways in the United States, Columbia University Press, 1928, pp. 97, 98, 100, 188, 189; cf.

Randall, of Omaha, Neb., for appellant.\n Messrs. Edwin Vail, of Lincoln, Neb., John E. Benton, of Washington, D.C., and Wm. H. Wright, of Lincoln, Neb., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on appeal under section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended (28 U.S.C.A.  344) from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska, 128 Neb. 447, 259 N.W. 362, affirming an order of the Nebraska State Railway Commission which directs \n\n[297 U.S. 471, 473]\n\u00a0\n appellant telephone company to use, for purposes of accounting and reporting to the commission, for the year 1934, a composite depreciation rate of 3 1\/2 per cent. upon all its depreciable property in Nebraska.\n Appellant now assails the order on three grounds: (1) That it was made without such notice and hearing as due process requires; (2) that it is invalid because the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to Congressional legislation, has occupied the field of regulation of telephone company accounting, and has made valid orders conflicting with that of the State Commission; and (3) that it infringes due process because it is unsupported by evidence and deprives appellant of the right to keep accurate books of account.\n The record does not disclose what, if any, federal questions were presented to the state Supreme Court. Its opinion discusses only the first two contentions made here, and we accordingly confine our review to them. See Miedreich v. Lauenstein, \n232 \nU.S. 236\n, 34 S.Ct. 309; Cissna v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 289\n, 38 S.Ct. 306; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S.Ct. 225.\n\n 1. \nAssuming, without deciding, that due process requires that the commission's order be upon notice to appellant and opportunity to be heard, we think that requirement was satisfied by the procedure followed by the commission. The challenged order was made at the conclusion of proceedings initiated by the State Commission by its General Order No. 59, directing class A telephone companies, to which class appellant belongs, to file with the commission specified schedules of depreciation rates. The order was prefaced by an opinion of the commission.\n The opinion, after reciting the authority conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission by section 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 493 (49 U.S.C. A.  20), to fix and prescribe depreciation charges for telephone companies, refers to \n\n[297 U.S. 471, 474]\n\u00a0\n the order of that commission of July 28, 1931, In Depreciation Charges of Telephone Companies, docket No. 14700, 177 I.C.C. 351, which, for the assistance of the commission in prescribing depreciation charges, required class A telephone companies to file with their respective state commissions by September 1, 1932, their estimates of composite annual percentage depreciation rates applicable to each class of depreciable property owned or used by them, with supporting data. The order provided for the adoption of a depreciation rate by the commission, to be effective January 1, 1933. The opinion of the State Commission points out that by later order of the Interstate Commerce Commission the filing date was postponed to August 1, 1934, and the date for the prescribed rate to January 1, 1935\n\n\n The opinion also refers to the Depreciation Section Service Circular 7, issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission Bureau of Accounts, which requested that schedules of depreciation rates and statements of estimated service lives and salvage values of telephone property be submitted not later than March 1, 1934, 'in order that he Commission may be informed as to the rates co templated for use' by the telephone companies for the year 1934. The opinion states that it is the view of the State Commission that it has not been deprived of jurisdiction to fix rates for intrastae telephone service, and that, while Congress has given the Interstate Commerce Commission authority to prescribe a uniform system of accounting and rates of depreciation for purposes of accounting to it, the state commissions are not deprived of their authority to fix rates of depreciation so far as their own accounting and reporting system is concerned.\n The commission accordingly ordered that class A telephone companies file with it, not later than March 1, 1934, a schedule of depreciation rates by primary accounts which they proposed to apply for the calendar year 1934, \n\n[297 U.S. 471, 475]\n\u00a0\n with such supporting data as is required by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and to file not later than August 1, 1934, their composite annual percentage depreciation rates to be effective January 1, 1935, in accordance with the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in docket No. 14700, and its supplemental orders. The order of the State Commission concludes with the statement that it approves the procedure adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission for prescribing depreciation rates, except that 'It reserves the right to review the findings and conclusions of the Interstate Commerce Commission and enter a final order thereon as to the depreciation rate for accounting purposes to this commission.'\n In compliance with this order appellant, on March 1, 1934, filed schedules classifying its depreciable property in twelve accounts, with estimated rates of depreciation of each class for 1934, and showing a composite estimated rate of depreciation on all accounts of 4.48 per cent.\n Upon examination of these schedules the commission made a further order, on March 6, 1934, reciting that depreciation rates for 1934 had been filed and that it was not 'fully satisfied with the rates proposed,' and directing that the case be set 'for hearing for oral examination of the members of respondent's staff, who had prepared said schedules, and for the introduction of such evidence as the Commission may desire to submit with opportuniy of objections and cross-examination by respondent.'\n Appellant argues that throughout these proceedings it was not advised that the commission proposed to make any order with respect to depreciation rates for 1934, or to do more than make recommendations as to the proper depreciation rates to be adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission for 1935. But it was evident from the opinion and orders of the commission mentioned that it proposed to deal with two aspects of appellant's depre- \n\n[297 U.S. 471, 476]\n\u00a0\n ciation accounting. One was the gathering of data with respect to the proposed rates of depreciation for 1935, which the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission had directed should be filed with the state commissions, and as to which the latter had been requested to submit their recommendations. The other related to the State Commission's asserted authority to fix depreciation rates, its rejection of the proposed rates for 1934 as unsatisfactory, and its direction that hearings be had on them. That the primary purpose of the hearing was to aid the commission in its rate-making rather than its advisory function seems apparent, the more so as the order for the hearing refers only to the 1934 rates and as the date set for it was in March, four months before August 1, 1934, the date fixed for filing data for the 1935 rate, with respect to which alone the commission had been asked to exercise its advisory function. Because of subsequent postponements the date for submitting the data for 1935 never arrived.\n Possibility of doubt as to the purpose of the hearing was removed in its course before the commission. At the outset the presiding commissioner announced that the purpose was to fix the 1934 rate, a statement which he repeated later in the course of the hearing on the sam day. To this appellant made no objection. The hearing occupied two days. Appellant was represented by counsel. It produced witnesses, including its own engineer and others who had prepared the filed depreciation schedules for 1934, who were examined and cross-examined at length. No evidence tendered by it was rejected. So much of the testimony as is included in the bill of exceptions occupies 151 pages of the printed record. It discloses that both the commission and the appellant were seeking to establish the proper rate of depreciation to be applied to appellant's property for 1934. The state court rightly concluded that appellant was afforded \n\n[297 U.S. 471, 477]\n\u00a0\n a full hearing upon adequate notice that the commission proposed to fix a depreciation rate for 1934, and that the requirements of due process were satisfied.\n\n 2. \nThe remaining question is whether the jurisdiction conferred by Congress upon the Interstate Commerce Commission over accounts and depreciation rates of telephone companies, and the exercise of that jurisdiction by the commission, have operated to curtail state authority over depreciation rates for 1934.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission was given no jurisdiction over telephone service rates, but sections 1(1), 20(1)(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 584, 593 (49 U. S.C.A.  1(1) and note 20(1)(5) notes), see 36 Stat. 555, 556 (49 U.S.C.A .  20(2), conferred on the commission authority, in its discretion, to prescribe a uniform system of accounts for telephone companies, and made it unlawful for them to keep any accounts other than those prescribed or approved by the commission. Such a system of accounts was required by the commission February 1, 1913. Effective January 1, 1933, it prescribed a revised system of accounts for class A and class B telephone companies and directed that they keep all accounts in conformity to it.\n The commission never undertook to prescribe rates of depreciation for telephone companies under the act of 1906. But the Transportation Act of February 28, 1920,  435 (49 U.S.C.A.  20(5), again amending section 20(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act, directed the commission, 'as soon as practicable,' to prescribe the classes of property of carriers, including telephone companies, 'for which depreciation charges may properly be included under operating expenses and the percentages of depreciation which shall be charged with respect to each of such classes of property.' Carriers were forbidden to charge depreciation rates other than those prescribed by the commission. Since 1920 the Interstate Commerce Commission has taken steps \n\n[297 U.S. 471, 478]\n\u00a0\n preparatory to he establishment of rates of depreciation for telephone companies, some of which we have mentioned. The adoption of rates has been postponed from time to time and has now been indefinitely postponed by order of the Communications Commission of May 1, 1935, to which the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission over telephone companies was transferred by Act of Congress of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064 (47 U.S. C.A.  151 et seq.).\n We leave aside the argument of respondent that the federal government is powerless to deny to the states authority to prescribe accounts and depreciation rates to assist them in fixing rates for intrastate telephone service, see Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194\n, 32 S.Ct. 436; compare Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 586\n, 15 S.Ct. 673; Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124; Ambrosini v. United States, \n187 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 23 S.Ct. 1, and pass to the question, decisive of the present case, whether there has yet been any exercise of such power. Both the language of the statute already quoted, and the nature of its subject- matter indicate that it contemplated no restriction of state control over depreciation rates until the Interstate Commerce Commission had presceibed its own rates. State commissions were not deprived of power to fix rates for intrastate telephone service, in determining which rates of depreciation chargeable to operating expenses play an important part. See Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n292 \nU.S. 151\n, 54 S.Ct. 658. The statute did not envisage an immediate adoption of depreciation rates by the Interstates Commerce Commission. A long period might elapse, as the event has shown, before the commission would be prepared to act. It cannot be supposed that Congress intended by the amendment to section 20(5) to preclude all regulation, state and national, of depreciation rates for telephone companies, for an indefinite time, until the Interstate Commerce Commission \n\n[297 U.S. 471, 479]\n\u00a0\n could act administratively to prescribe rates. See Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 510\n, 38 S.Ct. 170; Board of Railroad Commissioners v. Great Northern R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 412, 430\n, 50 S.Ct. 391. In Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133, 139\n, 51 S.Ct. 65, this court pointed out that until the Interstate Commerce Commission has prescribed depreciation rates the prerogative of the state to regulate such rates cannot be gainsaid. See, also, Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Larabee Flour Mills Co., \n211 \nU.S. 612, 623\n, 29 S.Ct. 214.\n When respondent fixed the composite rate of depreciation applicable to all classes of appellant's property for 1934, the Interstate Commerce Commission had prescribed no rate. It had given directions for filing data with state commissions preparatory to establishing a rate for the year 1935, and by the revised uniform system of accounts for telephone companies, effective in 1933, it had prescribed (instruction 81(A)(C) the method by which depreciation accounts should be kept, directing that there be a composite annual percentage rate of depreciation for each account covering depreciable property, and that until rates 'prescribed by this Commission become effective' the company's estimated composite rate be used.\n It is said that the company rate, use of which was thus authorized for accounting purposes, must be taken as the prescribed rate until the commission has fixed its own rate, and that in consequence state commissions are powerless to disturb it. But the order shows on its face that the commission did not regard the company rates as rates prescribed by the commission as required by section 20(5) and we think the purpose of the order, made plain by its language, was to establish a method of accounting, not to prescribe depreciation rates within the meaning of section 20(5). It thus, without purporting to restrict the power of state commissions over depreciation rates, left the telephone companies free, so far as the Interstate \n\n[297 U.S. 471, 480]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Commission was concerned, to use their own depreciation rates for purposes of the required accounting, until the commission performed the duty to establish rates, imposed upon it by Congress.\n In any event, we think that section 20(5) cannot be read as authorizing the Interstate Commerce Commission to supplant state power to regulate depreciation rates of telephone companies except by prescribing a rate administratively determined by the commission itself. A direction that the commission, as soon as practicable, prescribe depreciation rates, is hardly to be read as authority to permit the telephone companies to fix the rates for themselves in defiance of state power. The doubtful constitutionality of the statute, if so construed, precludes our acceptance of such a construction.\n The commission has thus prescribed no depreciation rates as required by section 20(5). No exertion of federal authority, through the Interstate Commerce Act,  20(5-7), 49 U.S.C.A.  20(5-7) the orders of the commission, or otherwise, forbids the making of entries in appellant's accounts or the doing of anything that is by the state commission's order directed to be done. Pending action by the Communications Commission e tablishing depreciation rates for telephone companies, state control over such rates remains unimpaired. We are not called upon now to consider the effect upon state power of such rates when adopted, or, in view of the state of the record, to consider other objections to the order of the State Commission fixing for appellant a composite depreciation rate of 3 1\/2 per cent.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOLD DEARBORN DISTRIBUTING CO. v.

Stat.1935, c. 140,  8 et seq.), providing as follows:\n'Section 1. No contract relating to the sale or resale of a commodity which bears, or the label or content of which bears, the trade mark, brand or name of the producer or owner of such commodity and which is in fair and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced by others shall be deemed in violation of any law of the State of Illinois by reason of any of the following provisions which may be contained in such contract:\n\n'(1) That the buyer will not resell such commodity except at the price stipulated by the vendor.\n\n'(2) That the producer or vendee of a commodity require upon the sale of such commodity to another, that such purchaser agree that he will not, in turn, resell except at the price stipulated by such producer or vendee. \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n 'Such provisions in any contract shall be deemed to contain or imply conditions that such commodity may be resold without reference to such agreement in the following cases:\n\n'(1) In closing out the owner's stock for the purpose of discontinuing delivery of any such commodity: provided, however, that such stock is first offered to the manufacturer of such stock at the original invoice price, at least ten (10) days before such stock shall be offered for sale to the public.\n\n'(2) When the goods are damaged or deteriorated in quality, and notice is given to the public thereof.\n\n'(3) By any officer acting under the orders of any court.\n\n'Section 2. Wilfully and knowingly advertising, offering for sale or selling any commodity at less than the price stipulated in any contract entered into pursuant to the provisions of section 1 of this Act, whether the person so advertising, offering for sale or selling is or is not a party to such contract, is unfair competition and is actionable at the suit of any person damaged thereby.'\n\n Section 3 of the act (Smith-Hurd Ill.Stats. c. 121 1\/2,  190) provides that it shall not apply to contracts or agreements between producers or between wholesalers or between retailers as to sale or resale prices. \n No. 226\n is a suit brought by appellee against appellant to enjoin the latter from wilfully and knowingly advertising, offering for sale, or selling, certain brands of whisky at less than prices stipulated by appellee in accordance with contracts, made in pursuance of the Fair Trade Act, between appellee and distributors or retailers of such whisky. The facts set forth by the court below follow.\n Appellee is a dealer in alcoholic beverages at wholesale. It buys the products here in question from the producers. The whiskies bear labels and trade-marks, and are in fair and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced by others. Appellant is a corporation operating four retail liquor stores in Chicago, \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 187]\n\u00a0\n and selling at both wholesale and retail. Appellee's sales in Chicago are made to wholesale distributors. It has not sold any of the whiskies in controversy to appellant, but has sold other liquors. Contracts in pursuance of the Fair Trade Act have been executed between appellee and certain distributors, and numerous Illinois retailers. Appellee does not sell directly to any retailer. Appellant sold the products in question at cut prices-that is to say, at prices below those stipulated-and continued to do so after appellee's demand that it cease such practice. The result of such price cutting was a diminution of sales during the price-cutting period suffered by appellee and retailers other than appellant. Some dealers ceased to display the products, and notified appellee that they could not compete with appellant and would discontinue handling the products unless the price cutting was stopped. Appellant was also a party to breaches of other fair trade contracts between appellee and certain distributors, and continued the price cutting throughout the trial of the case in the Illinois state court of first instance.\n The record shows that one of the retailer's contracts drawn in pursuance of the act was signed by appellant's secretary and treasurer prior to the commission of the acts complained of. This contract, among other things, provided that the product in question should not be sold, advertised, or offered for sale in Illinois below the prices to be stipulated by appellee. The contract was assailed by appellant below as ineffective, and for present purposes we accept that view. It is plain enough, however, that appellant had knowledge of the original contractual restrictions and that they constituted conditions upon which sales thereafter were to be made.\n No. 372 is a suit of the same character as No. 226, seeking the same relief by injunction. The facts set forth in the complaint were admitted by a motion to dismiss. These facts, fully stated in the opinion of the court below, \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n infra, we find it unnecessary to repeat. It is enough to say that while they differ in detail from those appearing in No. 226, they are sufficiently the same in substance as to be controlled by the same principles of law.\n Both appellants attack the validity of the act upon the grounds that it denies due process of law and the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in the particulars which hereafter appear. The state courts of first instance in which the suits were brought sustained the validity of the act and entered decrees as prayed for in the bills of complaint. These decrees were affirmed upon appeal by the court below. Joseph Triner Corporation v. McNeil, 363 Ill. 559, 2 N.E.(2d) 929, 104 A.L.R. 1435; Seagram-Distillers Corporation v. Old Dearborn Distributing Co., 363 Ill. 610, 611, 2 N.E.(2d) 940.\n The Illinois statute constitutes a legislative recognition of a rule which had been accepted by many of the state courts as valid at common law. This rule was based upon the distinction found to exist between articles of trade put out by the manufacturer or producer under and identified by patent, copyright, trade-mark, brand, or similar device and articles of like character put out by others and not so identified. The same rule was followed for a time by some of the lower federal courts; but their decisions were upset by this court in a series of cases, of which Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., \n220 \nU.S. 373\n, 31 S.Ct. 376, is an example. In that case this court held that a system of contracts between manufacturers and wholesale and retail merchants which sought to control the prices for sales by all such dealers by fixing the amount which the consumer should pay, amounted to an unlawful restraint of trade, invalid at common law and, so far as interstate commerce was affected, invalid under the Sherman Anti-Trust act of July 2, 1890 (15 U.S. C.A.  1-7, 15 note); and it was held that the rule applied to such agreements notwithstanding the fact that they related to proprietary medicines made under a secret process and identified by dis- \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 189]\n\u00a0\n tinctive packages, labels, and trade-marks. The argument that since the manufacturer might make and sell or not as he chose, he could lawfully condition the price at which subsequent sales could be made by the purchaser, was rejected.\n'If there be an advantage to the manufacturer in the maintenance of fixed retail prices,' this court said at pages 407-409 of 220 U.S., at pages 384, 385 of 31 S.Ct., 'the question remains whether it is one which he is entitled to secure by agreements restricting the freedom of trade on the part of dealers who own what they sell. As to this, the complainant can fare no better with its plan of identical contracts than could the dealers themselves if they formed a combination and endeavored to establish the same restrictions, and thus to achieve the same result, by agreement with each other. If the immediate advantage they would thus obtain would not be sufficient to sustain such a direct agreement, the asserted ulterior benefit to the complainant cannot be regarded as sufficient to support its system. ... The complainant's plan falls within the principle which condemns contracts of this class. It, in effect, creates a combination for the prohibited purposes. No distinction can properly be made by reason of the particular character of the commodity in question. It is not entitled to special privilege or immunity. It is an article of commerce, and the rules concerning the freedom of trade must be held to apply to it. ... The complainant having sold its product at prices satisfactory to itself, the public is entitled to whatever advantage may be derived from competition in the subsequent traffic.'\n\n It is unnecessary to review the contrary state decisions. It is enough, for present purposes, to say that, generally speaking, they sustained contracts standardizing the price at which 'identified' commodities subsequently might be sold, where the price standardization is primarily effected to protect the good will created or enlarged by the identi- \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 190]\n\u00a0\n fying mark or brand. Where a manufacturer puts out an article of general production identified by a special trade-mark or brand, the result of an agreement fixing the subsequent sales price affects competition between the identified articles alone, leaving competition between articles so identified by a given manufacturer and all other articles of like kind to have full play. In other words, such restraint upon competition as there may be is strictly limited to that portion of the entire product put out and plainly identified by a particular manufacturer or producer.\n The ground upon which the opposing view of this court proceeds is that such an agreement, nevertheless, constitutes an unlawful restraint of trade at common law and, in respect of interstate commerce, a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. A careful reading of the decisions discloses no other ground.\n Following these decisions, bills were introduced in Congress from time to time authorizing standardization of price agreements in respect of identified goods, upon which extensive hearings were held by the appropriate congressional committees. These bills are in all essential respects like the Illinois act. The hearings disclose exhaustive legal briefs, and testimony and arguments for and against the economic value of the proposed laws. See, for example, Hearings before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives, on H.R. 13305 (63d Cong., 2d and 3d Sess.); H.R. 13568 (64th Cong., 1st and 2d Sess.); compare Report of the Federal Trade Commission on Resale Price Maintenance, 70th Cong., 2d Sess., H. Doc. No. 546.\n It is not without significance that while the proposed legislation was vigorously assailed in other respects, we do not find that any constitutional objection was urged. And the decisions of this court, far from suggesting any constitutional infirmity in such proposed legislation, con- \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 191]\n\u00a0\n tain implications to the contrary. In the Dr. Miles Medical Co. Case, \n220 U.S. 373\n, at page 405, 31 S.Ct. 376, 383, the court said: 'Nor can the manufacturer by rule and notice, in the absence of contract or statutory right, even though the restriction be known to purchasers, fix prices for future sales.' (Italics supplied.) In Boston Store v. American Graphophone Co., \n246 U.S. 8\n, at page 26, 38 S.Ct. 257, Ann.Cas.1918C, 447, where this court struck down a stipulation that patented articles should not be resold at prices other than those fixed presently and from time to time by the patent owner, it was suggested that if this view resulted in damage to the holders of patent rights or the law afforded insufficient protection to the inventor, the remedy lay within the scope of legislative (that is to say, congressional) action. And in a concurring opinion (246 U.S. at page 28, 38 S.Ct. at page 262, Ann.Cas.1918C, 447), it was said: 'If the rule so declared is believed to be harmful in its operation, the remedy may be found, as it has been sought, through application to the Congress.' The words 'as it has been sought' quite evidently referred to the bills of which we have just spoken, since they had theretofore been introduced and made the subject of the hearings. See, also, Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, \n229 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 33 S.Ct. 616, 50 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1185, Ann.Cas.1915A, 150. While these observations of the court cannot, of course, be regarded as decisive of the question, they plainly imply that the court at the time foresaw no valid constitutional objection to such legislation, for it cannot be supposed that the court would suggest a legislative remedy the validity of which might seem open to doubt.\n In the light of the foregoing brief resume of the question with respect to the standardization of selling prices of identified goods in the absence of statutory authority, we proceed to a consideration of the specific objections to the constitutionality of the act here under review.\n First. In respect of the due process of law clause, it is contended that the statute is a price-fixing law, which has the effect of denying to the owner of property the right \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 192]\n\u00a0\n to determine for himself the price at which he will sell. Appellants invoke the well-settled general principle that the right of the owner of property to fix the price at which he will sell it is an inherent attribute of the property itself, and as such is within the protection of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Tyson & Brother United Theatre Ticket Offices v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418, 429\n, 47 S.Ct. 426, 427, 428, 58 A.L.R. 1236; Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 537\n, 43 S.Ct. 630, 633, 27 A.L.R. 1280; Ribnik v. McBride, \n277 \nU.S. 350\n, 48 S.Ct. 545, 56 A.L.R. 1327; Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 \nU.S. 235\n, 49 S.Ct. 115, 60 A.L.R. 596; New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, \n285 \nU.S. 262\n, 52 S.Ct. 371. These cases hold that, with certain exceptions, which need not now be set forth, this right of the owner cannot be denied by legislative enactment fixing prices and compelling such owner to adhere to them. But the decisions referred to deal only with legislative price fixing. They constitute no authority for holding that prices in respect of 'identified' goods may not be fixed under legislative leave by contract between the parties. The Illinois Fair Trade Act does not infringe the doctrine of these cases.\n Section 1 (Smith-Hurd Ill.Stats. c. 121 1\/2,  188) affirms the validity of contracts of sale or resale of commodities identified by the trade-mark, brand, or name of the producer or owner, which are in fair and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced by others, notwithstanding that such contracts stipulate: (1) That the buyer will not resell except at the price stipulated by the vendor; and (2) that the producer or vendee of such a commodity shall require, upon the sale to another, that he agree in turn not to resell except at the price stipulated by such producer or vendee. It is clear that this section does not attempt to fix prices, nor does it delegate such power to private persons. It permits the designated private persons to contract with respect thereto. It contains no element of compulsion but simply legalizes their acts, leaving them free to enter into the authorized contract or not as they may see fit. Thus far, the act plainly is not open to objection; and none seems to be made. \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 193]\n\u00a0\n The challenge is directed against section 2 (Smith-Hurd Ill.Stats. c. 121 1\/2,  189), which provides that wilfully and knowingly advertising, offering for sale or selling any commodity at less than the price stipulated in any contract made under section 1, whether the person doing so is or is not a party to the contract, shall constitute unfair competition, giving rise to a right of action in favor of anyone damaged thereby.\n It is first to be observed that section 2 reaches not the mere advertising, offering for sale, or selling at less than the stipulated price, but the doing of any of these things willfully and knowingly. We are not called upon to determine the case of one who has made his purchase in ignorance of the contractual restriction upon the selling price, but of a purchaser who has had definite information respecting such contractual restriction and who, with such knowledge, nevertheless proceeds willfully to resell in disregard of it.\n In the second place, section 2 does not deal with the restriction upon the sale of the commodity qua commodity, but with that restriction because the commodity is identified by the trade-mark, brand, or name of the producer or owner. The essence of the statutory violation then consists not in the bare disposition of the commodity, but in a forbidden use of the trademark, brand, or name in accomplishing such disposition. The primary aim of the law is to protect the property-namely, the good will-of the producer, which he still owns. The price restriction is adopted as an appropriate means to that perfectly legitimate end, and not as an end in itself.\n Appellants here acquired the commodity in question with full knowledge of the then existing restriction in respect of price which the producer and wholesale dealer had imposed, and, of course, with presumptive if not actual knowledge of the law which authorized the restriction. Appellants were not obliged to buy; and their voluntary acquisition of the property with such knowledge carried \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 194]\n\u00a0\n with it, upon every principle of fair dealing, assent to the protective restriction, with consequent liability under section 2 of the law by which such acquisition was conditioned. Cf. Provident Institution v. Jersey City, \n113 \nU.S. 506, 514\n, 515 S., 5 S.Ct. 612; Vreeland v. O'Neil, 36 N.J.Eq. 399, 402; same case on appeal, Vreeland v. Mayor, etc., of Jersey City, 37 N.J.Eq. 574, 577.\n We find nothing in this situation to justify the contention that there is an unlawful delegation of power to private persons to control the disposition of the property of others, such as was condemned in Eubank v. Richmond, \n226 \nU.S. 137, 143\n, 33 S.Ct. 76, 42 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1123; State of Washington, ex rel. Seattle Trust Co. v. Roberge, \n278 \nU.S. 116, 121\n, 122 S., 49 S.Ct. 50, 51, 52, 86 A.L.R. 654; and Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238, 311\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, 872, 873. In those cases the property affected had been acquired without any preexisting restriction in respect of its use or disposition. The imposition of the restriction in invitum was authorized after complete and unrestricted ownership had vested in the persons affected. Here, the restriction, already imposed with the knowledge of appellants, ran with the acquisition and conditioned it.\n Nor is section 2 so arbitrary, unfair or wanting in reason as to result in a denial of due process. We are here dealing not with a commodity alone, but with a commodity plus the brand or trade-mark which it bears as evidence of its origin and of the quality of the commodity for which the brand or trade-mark stands. Appellants own the commodity; they do not own the mark or the good will that the mark symbolizes. And good will is property in a very real sense, injury to which, like injury to any other species of property, is a proper subject for legislation. Good will is a valuable contributing aid to business-sometimes the most valuable contributing asset of the producer or distributor of commodities. And distinctive trade-marks, labels and brands, are legitimate aids to the creation or enlargement of such good will. It is well settled that the proprietor of the good will 'is entitled to protection as against one who attempts to deprive him \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 195]\n\u00a0\n of the benefits resulting from the same, by using his labels and trade- mark without his consent and authority.' McLean v. Fleming, \n96 U.S. 245\n, 252. 'Courts afford redress or relief upon the ground that a party has a valuable interest in the good will of his trade or business, and in the trademarks adopted to maintain and extend it.' Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, \n240 \nU.S. 403, 412\n, 36 S.Ct. 357, 360. The ownership of the good will, we repeat, remains unchanged, notwithstanding the commodity has been parted with. Section 2 of the act does not prevent a purchaser of the commodity bearing the mark from selling the commodity alone at any price he pleases. It interferes only when he sells with the aid of the good will of the vendor; and it interferes then only to protect that good will against injury. It proceeds upon the theory that the sale of identified goods at less than the price fixed by the owner of the mark or brand is an assault upon the good will, and constitutes what the statute denominates 'unfair competition.' See Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Burley Tobacco Growers' Ass'n, \n276 \nU.S. 71, 91\n, 92 S., 96, 97, 48 S.Ct. 291, 295, 296, 297. There is nothing in the act to preclude the purchaser from removing the mark or brand from the commodity-thus separating the physical property, which he owns, from the good will, which is the property of another-and then selling the commodity at his own price, provided he can do so without utilizing the good will of the latter as an aid to that end.\n There is a great body of fact and opinion tending to show that price cutting by retail dealers is not only injurious to the good will and business of the producer and distributor of identified goods, but injurious to the general public as well. The evidence to that effect is voluminous; but it would serve no useful purpose to review the evidence or to enlarge further upon the subject. True, there is evidence, opinion and argument to the contrary; but it does not concern us to determine where the \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 196]\n\u00a0\n weight lies. We need say no more than that the question may be regarded as fairly open to differences of opinion. The legislation here in question proceeds upon the former and not the latter view; and the legislative determination in that respect, in the circumstances here disclosed, is conclusive so far as this court is concerned. Where the question of what the facts establish is a fairly-debatable one, we accept and carry into effect the opinion of the Legislature. Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 44 S.Ct. 325, 326, Zahn v. Board of Public Works, \n274 \nU.S. 325, 328\n, 47 S.Ct. 594, 595, and cases cited.\n Certain terms contained in the act are said to be fatally vague and indefinite, and therefore to deny due process of law under our decisions in Connally v. General Const. Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385, 390\n, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, et seq., and other cases. The contention is directed in the main against the phrase in section 1 of the act, 'fair and open competition,' and 'any commodity' and 'any contract entered into pursuant to the provisions of section 1' contained in section 2. The point is shown to be lacking in substance by the reasoning in the Connally Case, \n269 U.S. 385\n, at pages 391, 392, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 128, and the cases there cited. See particularly Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 U.S. 497\n, 501-503, 45 S.Ct. 141, 142, 143; United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81, 92\n, 41 S.Ct. 298, 301, 14 A.L.R. 1045, where it is said 'that, for reasons found to result either from the text of the statutes involved or the subjects with which they dealt, a standard of some sort was afforded.' Certainly, the phrase 'fair and open competition' is as definite as the phrase contained in section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C.A.  45) 'unfair methods of competition,' which this court has never regarded as being fatally uncertain. Federal Trade Commission v. Gratz, \n253 \nU.S. 421, 427\n, 40 S.Ct. 572, 574; Federal Trade Commission v. Beech-Nut Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441, 453\n, 40 S.Ct. 572, 574; Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643, 648\n, 51 S.Ct. 587, 590, 79 A.L.R. 1191. We think the phrases complained of are sufficiently definite, considering the whole statute; and that no one need be misled as to their meaning, or need suffer by reason of \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 197]\n\u00a0\n any supposed uncertainty. Cf. Miller v. Schoene, \n276 \nU.S. 272, 281\n, 48 S. Ct. 246, 248; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 69\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734.\n Second. The contention that section 2 of the act denies the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment proceeds upon the view that it confers a privilege upon the producers and owners of goods identified by trade-mark, brand, or name, which it denies in the case of unidentified goods. As this court many times has said, the equal protection clause does not preclude the states from resorting to classification for the purposes of legislation. It only requires that the classification 'must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.' Colgate v. Harvey, \n296 \nU.S. 404, 422\n, 423 S., 56 S.Ct. 252, 255, 256, 102 A.L.R. 54, and cases cited.\n Clearly, the challenged section of the Illinois act satisfies this test. Enough appears already in this opinion to show the essential difference between trade-marked goods and others not so identified. The entire struggle to bring about legislation such as the Illinois act embodies has been based upon this essential difference. In Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 296\n, 297 S., 44 S.Ct. 325, 327, we sustained a statute prohibiting night employment of women in restaurants in large cities, against the claim that it denied equal protection of the laws in that it did not apply to small cities, or to women employed as singers and performers, or to attendants in ladies' cloak rooms and parlors, or employees in hotel dining rooms and kitchens or in lunch rooms and restaurants conducted by employers for the benefit of their employees. Former decisions of the court were cited sustaining classifications based upon differences between fire insurance and other kinds of insurance; between railroads and other corporations; between barbershop employment and other kinds of labor; between \n\n[299 U.S. 183, 198]\n\u00a0\n 'immigrant agents' engaged in hiring laborers to be employed beyond the limits of a state and persons engaged in the business of hiring for labor within the state; between sugar refiners who produce the sugar and those who purchase it. Other illustrations of a similar character might be cited.\n But it is unnecessary to pursue the subject further; for, since the sole purpose of the present law is to afford a legitimate remedy for an injury to the good will which results from the use of trade-marks, brands, or names, it is obvious that its provisions would be wholly inapplicable to goods which are unmarked.\n Decrees affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nP. J. CARLIN CONST. CO. v. HEANEY(1936)\n\nArgued: October 13, 1936Decided: November 9, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[299 U.S. 41, 42]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. C. Sherwood, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. Henry Epstein, of Albany, N.Y., and Joseph A. McLaughlin, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Seeking an award for injuries received in the course of his employment, respondent, Heaney, instituted this proceeding before the New York State Industrial Board against his employer, P. J. Carlin Construction Company, and its insurance carrier, the Travelers Insurance Company, petitioners here. The Board granted an award; the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals approved.\n In September, 1932, the Construction Company, general contractor with principal place of business in New York City, was engaged in building operations on Rikers Island in East River. Respondent and others employed about the work crossed daily from New York City on the Observation, a steamboat owned by Captain Forsythe. They paid for this service.\n The owner operated the vessel in pursuance of an agreement with the Construction Company which provided: 'You are hereby licensed to operate a ferry service for the transportation of the men engaged upon the construction of the Rikers Island Penitentiary Building.' 'You are to be compensated therefor by collecting fares from the men at the rate of 10 a round trip. In the event that your fares do not reach the sum of $60.00 \n\n[299 U.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n upon any given day, we shall reimburse you for the difference. Where your fares exceed $60.00 a day, you will pay the excess to us up to a point where we are reimbursed for any monies paid to you by us under this license.' 'We understand that your boat is warranted to be in first class condition, with all necessary permits to operate in this service.'\n September 9, 1932, while on her way to Rikers Island with Heaney on board, a violent explosion wrecked the Observation. He and many others were seriously injured.\n Counsel for petitioners challenged the Board's jurisdiction upon the ground that as the accident occurred on navigable waters the rights and obligations of the parties were fixed by the maritime law. They also maintained that Heaney was not employed when injured.\n The Board found: 'Heaney stepped into his employment the moment he stepped aboard the said steamboat.' 'Such transportation by means of the steamship 'Observation' was included within and was part of the contract of employment between P. J. Carlin Construction Co., the employer herein, and Edward Heaney, the claimant, and was an incident of the claimant's employment. At the time Edward Heaney sustained the accidental injuries ... the status of the claimant and the employer herein was a matter of local concern, was subject to the regulation of the State and in no way worked prejudice to any characteristic feature of the General Maritime Law. The claim ... is within the jurisdiction of the Industrial Board and not such a matter as is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Admiralty Law. This claim comes within the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law (Consol.Laws, c. 67).'\n Without contesting the Board's finding in respect of employment, petitioners maintain here that the rights and obligations of the parties must be determined under \n\n[299 U.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n the maritime law and the state Compensation Act has no application. Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S.Ct. 438, 11 A.L.R. 1145; Spencer Kellogg & Sons, Inc., v. Hicks, \n285 \nU.S. 502\n, 52 S. Ct. 450, and kindred cases which hold that the rules of maritime law control rights and liabilities arising out of torts upon navigable waters are relied upon.\n But as the Court of Appeals has pointed out: 'No recovery is sought against the employer in this case because of any wrong alleged to have been done by the employer. A recovery is sought as the result of injuries for which the statute, read into the contract, gives a right to recovery.' 'An award under the Workmen's Compensation Law is not made on the theory that a tort has been committed; on the contrary, it is upon the theory that the statute giving the commission power to make an award is read into and becomes a part of the contract.' See Post v. Burger & Gohlke, 216 N.Y. 544, 111 N.E. 351, Ann.Cas.1916B, 158; Doey v. Howland Co., 224 N.Y. 30, 120 N.E. 53; also State Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Corporation, \n259 \nU.S. 263, 271\n, 42 S.Ct. 473, 25 A.L.R. 1013\n\n\n This Court has often ruled that the maritime law cannot be modified by state enactments so as materially to interfere with its essential uniformity. State Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Corporation, supra. But this doctrine, we think, has no application in the circumstances here presented. The present attempt is to enforce a liability assumed by employer and insurance carrier under a nonmaritime contract. All parties, as well as the accident, were within the limits of New York state. The contract had no direct relation to navigation; to enforce it against the parties before us will not materially interfere with the uniformity of any maritime rule. There is no claim against the ship or her owner; their rights are not in issue.\n Spencer Kellogg & Sons, Inc., v. Hicks, supra, does not support petitioners' position. There the vessel's owner was \n\n[299 U.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n held liable for injuries received on navigable waters in consequence of the master's negligence. The respondent here seeks to enforce a contract of employment which had no direct and immediate relation to navigation, business or commerce of the sea. North Pacific Steamship Co. v. Hall Bros.

Baumgartner, of Seattle, Wash., for appellees. \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 410]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The state of Washington laid upon practically all persons engaged in intrastate business an occupation tax effective August 1, 1933, to continue for twenty-four months. The tax is measured by a percentage of the gross income solely of that business; and, as construed, purports not to tax the privilege of doing interstate business. The rate for telephone companies is 3 per cent.; for railroads, 1 1\/2 per cent. Laws of Washington 1933, c. 191, p. 869. No. 544 is a suit by Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company against the tax commission to enjoin proceedings to enforce the tax. No. 573 is an action by the state against Great Northern Railway to collect the tax for the period ending December 31, 1933. No. 529 is a like action against Northern Pacific Railway. Each company is a foreign corporation. The cases are here on appeals from the Supreme Court of the state and were argued together. Each presents the question whether the statute, as applied, is obnoxious to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3). The railroads claim also that the statute violates the due process clause by taxing income earned outside the state. In each case the trial court held the statute void. The Supreme Court sustained its validity in all the cases. 48 P.(2d) 931; 48 P.( 2d) 938.\n None of the companies rests its challenge of the statute primarily upon proof that the tax, in fact, burdens interstate commerce. The telephone company relies wholly, and the railroads mainly, upon an alleged rule of law-the proposition that, when a foreign corporation engages within a state in both local and interstate commerce, an occupation tax laid upon the local business is necessarily void, unless the corporation is free in law and in fact to withdraw therefrom without discontinuing its interstate business. They urge that the alleged rule applies to \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 411]\n\u00a0\n them, claiming that inability to abandon the local business without also discontinuing the interstate is imposed by state and federal law, and arises also from practical considerations. They insist that the rule applies although the tax is not such in character or amount as to induce withdrawal from the local business. The railroads contend further that the tax, in fact, burdens interstate commerce.\n The trial court found, and the Supreme Court assumed, that practical considerations would prevent either of the railroads from abandoning its intrastate business without also withdrawing from the interstate. And this was assumed to be true of the telephone company. The operations of the two classes of business are inextricably intertwined. In the main, they are carried on at the same time, by the same employees, with the same plant, equipment, and facilities. The interstate business is found profitable when carried on in connection with the local, because the expenses of the joint operation are, under applicable accounting rules, apportioned between the two branches of the business. Withdrawal from local business would reduce by but a small percentage each company's cost of operation. The remaining unavoidable exp nse would be heavier than the interstate business could bear under the existing rates or under any conceivable increase. Moreover, the trial court ruled, and the Supreme Court assumed, that the governing law would not permit these corporations to withdraw from local business without discontinuing also the interstate.\n The state denies the existence of the alleged rule of law that an occupation tax upon intrastate business is necessarily void, if the corporation is not free to withdraw from the local business without discontinuing also the interstate. There is no denial that a tax upon the privilege of engaging in the local business is void if, by reason of its character or amount, it, in fact, imposes a direct \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 412]\n\u00a0\n burden upon interstate commerce. The state insists that this tax does not do so.\n First. Where interstate and intrastate commerce are served by the same instrumentalities of a common carrier, it is possible that a regulation of the state applied directly to the intrastate business only may in fact burden the interstate. Where this occurs, Congress may remove the burden, since state regulation must yield to its paramount power to assure adequate interstate service. That power is comprehensive, and has, under appropriate legislation, been extensively exercised. Through the Interstate Commerce Commission, Congress has commanded the raising of local rates where they were so low that the intrastate traffic did not bear its fair share of the cost of the service. It has prevented state authorities from compelling the erection of a union station so expensive as unduly to deplete the financial resources of the carrier. It has prevented the construction of an intrastate branch line which would have depleted the financial resources of the builder or of another interstate carrier. It has curtailed existing local service and authorized abandonment of a controlled line, despite the carrier's contract with the state to maintain the line. Such control over intrastate commerce exists because it is a necessary incident of freeing interstate commerce from burdens, obstructions, or discrimination. It has been exerted wherever Congress deemed that the state's power to regulate and promote intrastate commerce is exercised in such a way as to prejudice the interstate. Colorado v. United States, \n271 U.S. 153\n, 164-166, 46 S.Ct. 452.\n Similarly, where interstate and intrastate commerce are served by the same instrumentalities of the carrier, it is possible that a tax applied directly to the privilege of doing the local business may in fact burden the related interstate business. While a state may tax the privilege of engaging in local business, as it may regulate local \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 413]\n\u00a0\n rates, it may not tax the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce. Taxation being one of the forms of regulation, Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n145 \nU.S. 192, 200\n, 12 S.Ct. 806, any tax laid directly upon the privilege is void, even in the absence of legislation by Congress or a finding of prejudice. As local rates may be so low, and the circumstances such, that these rates must be raised in order to protect interstate commerce, so a tax on the privilege of engaging in local business may conceivably be so high, and the circumstances such, as to require lowering of the tax in order to protect interstate commerce. But the high tax on the local privilege, like the low rate for the local traffic, if it burdens interstate commerce at all, does so by reason of its consequences. This being so, a tax upon the local privilege only must be held valid in the absence of proof that it imposes an undue burden upon interstate commerce. 'The question of constitutional validity is not to be determined by artificial standards.' See Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, \n286 \nU.S. 472, 480\n, 52 S.Ct. 631, 634, 84 A.L.R. 831. The alleged indirect tax must be judged by its practical operation.\n In its effect upon interstate commerce an occupation tax solely upon local busine  does not differ from an ad valorem property tax upon tangible property used exclusively in such business. Each increases the necessary cost of doing the local business. Either might conceivably be so large as to render the local business immediately unprofitable. A common carrier cannot be compelled to carry on business indefinitely at a loss. Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n251 \nU.S. 396\n, 40 S.Ct. 183; Bullock v. Florida, \n254 \nU.S. 513, 520\n, 521 S., 41 S.Ct. 193; Railroad Commission v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n264 \nU.S. 79, 85\n, 44 S.Ct. 247. If, because of such loss, a corporation, seeing no prospect of betterment, wished to discontinue its local business and were prevented by law from doing so unless it discontinued also its interstate business, the law might be held void as im- \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 414]\n\u00a0\n posing an unconstitutional condition upon the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce. Compare Pullman Co. v. Adams, \n189 \nU.S. 420\n, 23 S.Ct. 494. If it was the tax which caused the unprofitableness of the local business and, consequently, the desire to discontinue it, the tax would then appear as a direct burden on interstate commerce. Compare Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, \n249 \nU.S. 252, 258\n, 39 S.Ct. 265; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Fremont, \n255 \nU.S. 124, 127\n, 41 S.Ct. 279. But no reason has been suggested why a tax upon the local business should be held void, if, despite its burden, the local business is conducted at a profit; or if, although conducted at an apparent loss, the corporation desires to continue it because of benefits present or prospective. Compare Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 590\n, 34 S.Ct. 372.\n Second. Inherently the tax challenged is unobjectionable. It is not upon an instrumentality of interstate commerce; it is moderate in amount; and is not a disguised attempt to discriminate against interstate commerce. As the collection is being made by an action at law, the tax is not open to the objection raised in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Massachusetts, \n125 \nU.S. 530, 554\n, 8 S.Ct. 961, that payment may be made a condition of continuing to do business. Compare Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 119\n, 41 S.Ct. 45. The tax is 'imposed solely on account of the intrastate business'; and it appears that the amount exacted is not increased 'because of the interstate business done.' Compare East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 465, 470\n, 51 S.Ct. 499, 500. Although the two branches of the business of the companies are inseparable, the tax is not laid inseparably upon both. Thus it is not open to the objection held fatal in Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640\n, 8 S.Ct. 1380, and Cooney v. Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Co., \n294 \nU.S. 384\n, 55 S.Ct. 477. 'Certainly one cannot avoid a tax upon a taxable business by also engaging in a nontaxable business.' Raley & Bros. v. Richardson, \n264 \nU.S. 157, 159\n, 44 S.Ct. 256, 257. \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 415]\n\u00a0\n The distinction drawn by those cases between an occupation tax valid because laid only on local business and one void because laid inseparably upon the whole business is clearly shown in the discussion of the two classes of taxes involved in Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 \nU.S. 642, 646\n, 647 S., 41 S.Ct. 606. Taxes for the privilege of doing local business measured by the gross income of such business have frequently been laid upon concerns engaged in both intrastate and interstate business; and have, for half a century, been sustained without inquiry whether withdrawal from the local business would compel discontinuance of the interstate. That an occupation tax upon a foreign telegraph company measured by earnings from its local business is valid was indicated as early as Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Texas, \n105 \nU.S. 460, 464\n, 465 S.; and was definitely held in Ratterman v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n127 U.S. 411\n, 8 .Ct. 1127, which has been repeatedly cited with approval, in cases involving interstate railroads and telegraph companies. \n1\n Similarly, in Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519, 529\n, 530 S., 43 S.Ct. 192, a so- called franchise tax for the privilege of doing intrastate business, measured by a percentage of the value of property subject also to an ad valorem tax, was sustained as against both foreign and domestic railroads.\n No decision of this Court lends support to the proposition that an occupation tax upon local business, otherwise valid, must be held void merely because the local and interstate branches are for some reason inseparable. In \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 416]\n\u00a0\n cases relied upon by appellants, there are expressions which may seem to support that contention. But in none of those cases was the challenged tax measured by the gross income of the intrastate business only. In some it was laid inseparably upon the privilege of doing both interstate and intrastate business. \n2\n In some the case was suggested of a compulsory local service which, coupled with a tax, might burden interstate commerce. \n3\n In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 190, and Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 56\n, 30 S.Ct. 232, the question presented, and on which the Court divided, was whether payment of a confessedly unconstitutional tax could be made a condition of permitting a foreign corporation to exercise the privilege of continuing to do intrastate business within the state. \n4\n It is true that in Sprout v. City of Sough Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 171\n, 48 S.Ct. 502, 505, 62 A.L.R. 45, the Court, when reciting the essentials of a valid license fee for doing local business, said that it must appear 'that the person taxed could discontinue the intrastate business without withdrawing also from the interstate.' \n5\n But that statement was made in discussing the validity of a flat bus license fee, prescribed by an which made no distinction between busses en- \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 417]\n\u00a0\n gaged exclusively in interstate commerce, those engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce, and those engaged in both classes of commerce; and it must be read in that context. The license fee was held void, because Sprout, who was engaged in both classes of commerce, could not escape payment of the tax by confining himself to interstate business. The cases cited by the Court in that connection were of the same character. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Third. The telephone company relies wholly upon the alleged rule of law. It makes no claim that the tax laid upon it in fact burdens interstate commerce. Nor could it do so. The company's business, both the intrastate and the interstate, was conducted at a profit during the tax period. The net operating income from the local business for the year 1933 was $781,338.44, after deducting taxes assignable thereto; the net operating income from the interstate business was $118,225.74.7 The tax for the five months ending December 31, 1933, is apparently $112,251.31. Not only is the intrastate business (even with the addition of this tax) no burden; it is that branch of the business which makes it financially possible to carry on the interstate. The gross operating revenues from interstate business were in 1933 only $932,424.74, while the total operating expenses of the company within the state were $7,649,933.89. The greater part of these expenses involved plant, equipment facilities and employees' services indispensable to the conduct of the in- \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 418]\n\u00a0\n terstate business; of the total expenses, $7,009,241.85 was charged to the intrastate business and only $640,692.04 to the interstate. As the statute is valid in the absence of a showing that the tax in fact directly burdened interstate commerce, the judgment against the telephone company is affirmed.\n Fourth. The Great Northern, besides invoking the alleged rule of law, claims that in fact the tax upon it directly burdens interstate commerce. The amount for the five months ending December 31, 1933, is $12,988.35. To prove that this tax burdens interstate commerce, it presented accounts which, as the trial court found, show that in the year 1933 the intrastate business resulted in a net operating deficit of $99,269. But, even if the items in the account are correct, it does not follow necessarily that the local business (with the tax upon it) directly burdens interstate commerce. The contrary appears. The gross operating revenues from the intrastate business were $2,179,760. To it were charged $1,730,361 of the company's operating expenses, leaving net operating revenues amounting to $449,399. The deficit of $99,269 is arrived at by deducting from these net revenues both railway tax accruals to the amount of $335,2478 and equipment and joint facility rentals to the amount of $213,421. It is true that, according to this allocation of the joint expenses and charges, it appears that the intrastate business was carried on at a small loss. But it is conceded that withdrawal from intrastate business and carrying on the interstate alone would have subjected the company to a very heavy loss. As the trial court found: 'The net result of abandonment by defendant of its intrastate passenger and freight business in order to escape the tax imposed by said Chapter 191, Law of 1933, would be the loss of $2,179,760 ( the whole intrastate gross oper ting \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 419]\n\u00a0\n revenues), and the saving of not more than 14% of that amount.'\n It is said that the deficit from the intrastate branch of the business was paid from profits of the interstate branch; and it is asserted that, as the tax would increase the amount of the deficit, it directly burdens interstate commerce. But this does not follow. Exery tax, and every other charge or item of expense, reduces to that extent the profit which otherwise would be made from doing business. This tax lessens the benefit derived by interstate commerce from the joint operation with it of the intrastate business; but, because of the advantage to the company (and to interstate commerce) in continuing to do the intrastate business, neither the tax of $12,988.35 here in question nor the other taxes allocated to the local business would induce the company to withdraw from the local business, even if it were permitted by law to do so. There is no more reason for saying that the $12,988.35, because an occupation tax, directly burdens interstate commerce, since it contributes to the operating deficit, than that the $335,247 taxes paid by local business under other statutes confessedly valid, do so. Since this tax is laid upon intrastate commerce only and is not shown to be a direct burden upon interstate commerce, or to be otherwise objectionable, the judgment against the Great Northern is affirmed. Compare Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Rochmond, \n249 \nU.S. 252, 257\n, 261 S., 39 S.Ct. 265; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Fremont, \n255 \nU.S. 124\n, 41 S.Ct. 279; Williams v. Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 417\n, 33 S.Ct. 116.\n Fifth. The Northern Pacific, besides invoking the alleged rule of law, claims also that the tax upon it directly burdens interstate commerce. The relevant facts are similar to those concerning the Great Northern; and the same rules of law govern both. The amount of the tax for the five months ending December 31, 1933, is $36,116.22. To prove that this tax in fact burdens inter- \n\n[297 U.S. 403, 420]\n\u00a0\n state commerce, the company presented accounts which, as the trial court found, show that in the year 1933 the intrastate business resulted in a net operating deficit of $192,507. On the other hand, to have abandoned the intrastate business while operating the interstate would have cost the company gross operating revenues of $5,271,893. Since the occupation tax challenged is not shown to be a direct burden upon the company's interstate business, the judgment against it is affirmed.\n What has been said above disposes of the contention of the railroads that the statute violated the due process clause. It also renders unnecessary consideration of the additional reasons urged by the state in support of the judgments of its Supreme Court. On these we express no opinion.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n128 \nU.S. 39, 40\n, 9 S. Ct. 6; Western Union Telegraph Co. v.

BROWN(1936)\nNo. 125\nArgued: December 13, 1935Decided: February 10, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edward F. Smith and Frank H. Pardee, both of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Matthew Brown, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the municipal court of Boston, Matthew Brown, trustee in bankruptcy of Metropolitan Builders' Supply Company, brought this action against Palmer Clay Products Company, to recover as preferences amounts received on account of an overdue debt. The court found as facts that the defendant had received several such payments within the four months preceding the filing of the petition \n\n[297 U.S. 227, 228]\n\u00a0\n in bankruptcy; and that at the time of each payment it had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent, and also that such payment would effect a preference over other creditors of the same class. It refused to rule that the burden rested on the plaintiff to prove further that each payment had the effect of enabling the defendant to receive a greater percentage of its debt than other creditors of the same class could have received at the time of such payment if the assets had then been liquidated. Judgment for $1,843 was entered pursuant to the rescript of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (195 N.E. 122), which, in approving the action of the trial court, followed Rubenstein v. Lottow, 223 Mass. 227, 111 N.E. 973. We granted certiorari, \n296 \nU.S. 556\n, 56 S.Ct. 98, because the decision, while in accord with Bronx Brass Foundry, Inc., v. Irving Trust Co., 76 F.(2d) 935, in the Second Circuit, and Commerce-Guardian Trust & Savings Bank v. Devlin, 6 F.(2d) 518, in the Sixth Circuit, conflicts with W. S. Peck & Co. v. Whitmer, 231 F. 893, and other cases in the Eighth Circuit. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The question for our determination is the construction to be given to section 60a (as amended by Act May 27, 1926,  14) and section 60b of the Bankruptcy Act. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[297 U.S. 227, 229]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner contends that a creditor who receives a part payment of his claim does not receive a preference, although he has reason to believe that the debtor is insolvent, provided the debtor's assets at the time of the payment would, if then liquidated and distributed, be sufficient to pay all the creditors of the same class an equal proportion of their claims.\n Whether a creditor has received a preference is to be determined, not by what the situation would have been if the debtor's assets had been liquidated and distributed among his creditors at the time the alleged preferential payment was made, but by the actual effect of the payment as determined when bankruptcy results. The payment on account of say 10 per cent. within the four months will necessarily result in such creditor receiving a greater percentage than other creditors, if the distribution in bankruptcy is less than 100 per cent. For where the creditor's claim is $ 10,000, the payment on account $1000, and the distribution in bankruptcy 50 per cent., the creditor to whom the payment on account is made receives $ 5,500, while another creditor to whom the same amount was owing and no payment on account was made will receive only $5,000. A payment which enables the creditor 'to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than any other of such creditors of the same class' is a preference.\n We may not assume that Congress intended to disregard the actual result, and to introduce the impractical rule of requiring the determination, as of the date of each payment, of the hypothetical question: What would have been the financial result if the assets had then been liquidated and the proceeds distributed among the then creditors?\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Mansfield Lumber Co. v.

The court gave judgment against the Pennsylvania for $44,428.09.2 That amount includes reparation, interest, and attorney's fee. The reparation adjudged is in respect of transportation on the Pennsyl- \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 453]\n\u00a0\n vania between October 28, 1920, and February 16, 1922, including that on the Panhandle after acquisition by the Pennsylvania. Petitioner appealed directly to the State Supreme Court, and there sought re ersal on the ground that, as later to be specified, the reparation order is repugnant to the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.), an order of the Commission, and the Constitution of the United States. After hearing argument, that court, being of opinion that the case had been erroneously appealed to it, directed transfer to the Appellate Court. There the judgment was affirmed; the Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari.\n First for consideraton is a question raised by the answer and decided by the Appellate Court, the highest court of the state in which a decision could be had. 28 U.S.C.  344(b), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b); Chicago, R.I. & P.

That question is whether the Illinois statutes under which the state commission acted and its order awarding respondent reparation are repugnant to the Interstate Commerce Act3 and the order \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 454]\n\u00a0\n of the Interstate Commerce Commission4 providing for the intrastate rates that became effective February 19, 1921, and continued in force until February 16, 1922, in respect of which the state commission made its award.\n The Chicago switching district is a large area in and near that city; it extends into Indiana, but by far the larger part is in Illinois. \n5\n A number of railroads, including the Pennsylvania and the Panhandle, extend into the district, and conduct within it transportation of brick and other commodities in intrastate and interstate commerce. There are many brickyards in the district and elsewhere in Illinois. Re pondent has several in the district and two at Bernice in Illinois, outside, but close to, the district. One of them is located on the Pennsylvania, and the other on the Panhandle.\n For a long time prior to federal control of railroads which commenced January 1, 1918, and up to June 25 of that year, the rate applicable to interstate and intrastate transportation of brick, by the Pennsylvania and Panhandle, respectively, from Bernice into the district and \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 455]\n\u00a0\n between points within the switching district, was 25 cents per ton.\n June 25, 1918, the Federal Railroad Administration, by General Order No. 28, increased rates on brick by 2 cents per hundred pounds. November 8, 1918, Freight Rate Authority No. 1887 substituted an increase of 25 per cent. for transportation within the district. These changes operated to make the rate from Gernice into the district 70 cents6 and that between points within the district 30 cents per ton.\n The Transportation Act (of February 28) 1920,  208(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  76(a), directed that existing rates should obtain until changed by federal or state authority or pursuant to authority of law.\n March 10, 1920, respondent complained to the Interstate Commerce Commission that the 70-cent rate was unreasonable and discriminatory. The Commission made its report and order October 27, 1921, the pertinent substance of which is given below.\n July 29, 1920, the Commission authorized increases applicable to interstate traffic of 40 per cent. and 35 per cent. respectively, in Eastern and Western groups and 33 1\/3 per cent. on intergroup transportation. Exparte 74.7 August 10, the Illinois commission authorized a general increase of 33 1\/3 per cent. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n August 11, the Interstate Commerce Commission ordered that Illinois territory be treated as within the Eastern group for the purpose of applying the authorized increase of 40 per cent. in the rates on interstate traffic between points in that territory. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n August 26, rates on intrastate transportation of brick established by the carriers pursuant to authority of the Illi- \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 456]\n\u00a0\n nois commission became effective. They were 93 1\/2 cents per ton from Bernice into the switching district in Illinois, and 40 cents between Illinois points within the district. October 18, having regard to the abovementioned order of August 11, the Illinois commission modified its order of August 10 so as to allow increases of 35 per cent. to be made effective November 15, instead of the 33 1\/3 per cent. it earlier permitted. \n10\n Accordingly, the intrastate rate from Bernice into the switching district became 94 1\/2 cents, and the rate between points within the district became 40 1\/2 cents.\n January 11, 1921, the Interstate Commerce Commission, dealing with intrastate rates within Illinois, notified and required carriers to cease and desist from practicing the undue prejudice, undue preference and advantage, and unjust discrimination which, as specified in the Commission's report, it found to exist. The order also notified and required the carriers to 'establish, put in force, and maintain rates and charges for freight services ... in intrastate commerce within the state of Illinois which shall exceed the rates and charges of the carriers now in force and applicable to such transportation in amounts corresponding to the increases heretofore made by the carriers, now in effect, under Ex Parte 74 ... in said carriers' rates and charges for freight services ... in interstate commerce within the state of Illinois and between points in the state of Illinois and points in other states in the eastern group, including the Illinois distri t. It is further ordered, That this order shall become effective on or before the 7th day of March, 1921, upon notice ... by not less than five days' filing and posting in the manner prescribed in section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A.  6), and remain in force until the further order of this Commission in the premises.' \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 457]\n\u00a0\n And the report, which was made a part of the order, stated: 'Some readjustments may be appropriate in individual instances where substantial injury results. ... Such inequalities as call for readjustment may be brought to our attention in the appropriate way and dealt with as occasion Requires. ... The record establishes that the present intrastate charges for freight services ... lower than the just and reasonable corresponding interstate rates and charges authorized in and established in the eastern group, including the Illinois district, pursuant to Ex Parte 74, afford intrastate traffic and shippers and localities within the state undue preference and subject interstate traffic and shippers and localities outside the state to undue prejudice, and unduly, unjustly, and unreasonably discriminate against interstate commerce.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n February 19, 1921, the carriers in accordance with the Commission's order, put in effect and until February 16, 1922, maintained for intrastate transportation a rate of 98 cents on brick from Bernice into the switching district and a rate of 42 cents between points within the district.\n October 27, 1921, the Interstate Commerce Commission, dealing with plaintiff's complaint filed March 10, 1920, found the 70-cent rate on brick in interstate commerce from Bernice into the district was not unreasonable, but that it was, and for the future would be, unduly prejudicial to the extent that it exceeded the rates from points within the district to interstate destinations therein by more than 10 cents per ton. It further found that respondent failed to show itself entitled to damages as the result of the undue prejudice. \n12\n The Commission ordered that the carriers 'cease and desist, on or before February 16, 1922, ... from ... collecting for the transportation of common brick in carloads, from Bernice ... (and \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 458]\n\u00a0\n other named points in Illinois and Indiana) to interstate destinations within the Chicago switching district rates which exceed the rates contemporaneously maintained by them on like traffic from points within said district to interstate destinations within said district by more than 10 cents per net ton.'\n And it ordered the carriers to 'establish, on or before February 16, 1922, upon notice ... by not less than 30 days' filing and posting ... and thereafter to maintain and apply to the transportation of common brick, in carloads, from Bernice ... (and other named points) to interstate destinations within the Chicago switching district rates which shall not exceed the rates contemporaneously maintained by them on like traffic from points within said switching district to interstate destinations within said district by more than 10 cents per net ton.'\n Then the carriers established and put in force effective February 16, 1922, a rate of 50 cents per ton for intrastate and interstate transportation from Bernice into the switching district and between points within it.\n October 28, 1922, respondent applied to the Illinois commission for reparation as to intrastate transportation from Bernice into the switching district. November 7, 1923, the commission dismissed the claim as to shipments prior to October 28, 1920, as barred by a statute of limitations. The commission found that, at the time the service in question was rendered (October 28, 1920, to February 16, 1922), 50 cents per ton provided adequate revenue for transportation of brick from Bernice to points within the switching district, that, to the extent the rates for that transpor ation exceeded by more than 10 cents per ton the rates contemporaneously applied between points within the district, they were unjustly discriminatory, and that respondent had been damaged to the extent that the charges collected by the carrier exceeded \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 459]\n\u00a0\n those that would have been assessed on a rate of 50 cents per ton. And on that basis the commission fixed the amount of its award. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n 1. \nTo the extent, if at all, that there is conflict between state and federal regulation, the latter must prevail. Unquestionably the Interstate Commerce Commission was authorized directly to prescribe, or to require the carriers to establish and maintain, intrastate rates to prevent or remove discrimination against interstate commerce or to make intrastate transportation yield its just proportion of the carriers' earnings. Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 210\n, 51 S.Ct. 119; Louisiana Public Service Commission v. Texas & N.O.R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 125, 131\n, 52 S.Ct. 74; Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1, 4\n, 54 S.Ct. 603. During the period between February 19, 1921, and February 16, 1922, the intrastate rates in force for transportation of brick by petitioner's railroad from Bernice into the switching district were maintained by petitioner pursuant to and in accordance with the Interstate Commerce Commission's order of January 11, 1921. By that order the Commission 'notified and required' carriers to cease the prejudice and discrimination against interstate commerce resulting from the application of their intrastate rates in force, and also 'notified and required' them to increase their intrastate rates and to make them correspond with the interstate rates theretofore increased in pursuance of its order in Ex parte 74. The Commission's direction to the carriers that they collect charges based on the intrastate rates required by its order was not less mandatory than was its direction to cease prejudice and discrimination. In order that the prescribed equality between intrastate and corresponding interstate rates should not be disturbed by state authority or by action of the carriers, the Commission declared that the order-and necessarily the rates directed-should continue in force until changed by it. \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 460]\n\u00a0\n And, anticipating possible need for further action, the Commission expressly suggested that individual instances of inequalities be brought to its attention for correction. Although respondent's complaint against the 70-cent rate established by Freight Rate Authority No. 1887 was still pending, the record discloses no application by respondent to amend or enlarge the scope of the complaint or any effort to have reduced the 98- cent rate directed by the Interstate Commerce Commission or to have corrected the inequality resulting from its order of January 11, 1921. There is no suggestion that the intrastate rates in respect of which the Illinois commission awarded reparation were not made in obedience to and in strict accordance with the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Save as the rate so prescribed might be dealt with under federal law, the carriers were bound to collect the charges based upon them. By the Interstate Commerce Act and that order the state was divested of jurisdiction, by specific order, award of reparation, or otherwise, to reduce the charges based on the intrastate rates so established. The order of the Illinois commission, in so far as it awards reparation in respect of transportation covered by rates that petitioner was required to put in force and maintain by the Interstate Commerce Commission's order of January 11, 1921, is plainly repugnant to the Interstate Commerce Act and to that order. To the extent, therefore, that the judgment depends on that part of the award, it is without foundation and cannot be sustained.\n\n 2. \nUnder the Interstate Commerce Commission's order of October 27, 1921, petitioner was free, upon the prescribed notice f 30 days, though not required before February 16, 1922, to reduce to not to exceed 10 cents the differential between the interstate rate from Bernice into the switching district and that for interstate transportation between points within the district. That order \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 461]\n\u00a0\n dealt only with interstate rates. But the order of January 11, 1921, established the rule of equality between rates for interstate and intrastate transportation from Bernice into the district and also for transportation between points within the district. On the facts found by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the law as applied by it, petitioner was required to maintain equality between these intrastate and interstate rates. There is nothing in the later report or order of October, 1921, to indicate intention on the part of the Commission to authorize or permit a change of the one without a like change in the other. The purpose, by exertion of federal authority to control both, persisted. The state commission was not, at any time after the intrastate rates were established under federal authority, authorized to condemn them or to award reparation in respect of transportation to which they applied. By the order of October 27, 1921, requiring adjustment of the interstate rates upon 30 days' notice on or before February 16, 1922, the Commission impliedly found that the time allowed was necessary to enable the carriers to compute the rates, prepare the schedules, and post them as required by law. There is no support for a claim that, as to transportation in the part of the period between the order October 77, 1921, and February 16, 1922, the Illinois commission had jurisdiction to grant reparation.\n\n 3. \nThere remains for consideration the part of the judgment that is based on the award made in respect of transportation between the earliest date within the period fixed by the statute of limitations, October 28, 1920, and the effective date of the Commission's order, February 19, 1921. The intrastate rates in effect during that time were made under authority of the state acting through its commission and pursuant to the above- mentioned orders of the latter August 10, 1920, authorizing 33 1\/3 per cent. increase and October 18, 1920, making the \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 462]\n\u00a0\n increase 35 per cent. The rates so increased superseded the 70-cent rate made by the carrier while under federal control. The state's jurisdiction as to them was untrammeled by any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission or other exertion of federal power. The reparation order, so far as it relates to that service, must be sustained unless found repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to, or the commerce clause (article 1,  8, cl. 3) of, the Federal Constitution.\n No such question was, by answer, motion, or otherwise, expressly raised in the trial court. Petitioner makes no claim that the reparation order was specifically challenged in the trial court as repugnant to either of these clauses, asserts that it was not necessary so to do, and maintains that, at the trial, there was by petitioner sufficiently drawn in question the validity of the order on the ground of its being repugnant to these provisions. The sole support for that claim is this: Respondent put in evidence the state commission's reparation order and the record on which it was based. In defense petitioner introduced the same record and the state commission's rate orders authorizing, respectively, 93 1\/2 cents and 94 1\/2 cents per ton for transportation from Bernice into the switching district.\n Plainly that was not enough. The Illinois statute requires that, in cases involving construction of the Federal Constitution, appeals from circuit courts shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court. \n14\n And, as definitely shown by its decisions, that court will not take jurisdiction unless it appears from the record that the constitutional ques- \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 463]\n\u00a0\n tion was urged in the lower court, the ruling on it preserved in the record, and the error ass gned on appeal. \n15\n While the order of that court transferring the case does not specify the grounds on which it was based, the petitioner states that the Supreme Court necessarily held the constitutional questions had not been properly raised, and that, on the oral argument, the Chief Justice stated that the transfer would be made because of petitioner's failure properly to raise and preserve the constitutional questions. The Appellate Court so understood the grounds and effect of the order, and held that by transferring the case the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional questions. As the highest court of the state declined to consider them because not raised in the circuit court or presented to it in accordance with practice that unquestionably was well established and reasonable, this court is without jurisdiction to consider either of them.

Petitioner's application for this writ suggests that, by a construction contrary to that theretofore put upon section 68 of the Illinois Public Utilities Act (Smith-Hurd Ann.St.Ill. c. 111 2\/3  72), it was denied an opportunity to be heard on the question whether the evidence before the Illinois commission was sufficient to sustain the reparation award. And upon that basis petitioner claims that there is here presented the question whether by denial of hearing it was deprived of property without due process of law. But, as is shown by the opinion of the Appellate Court, it did hear petitioner and respondent on that question and decided it in favor of the latter. \n\n[297 U.S. 447, 464]\n\u00a0\n There is no foundation for petitioner's claim that it was denied hearing.\n The judgment below will be reversed, and the case remanded, with directions for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Illinois Public Utilities Act,  72, Laws Illinois 1921, p. 745 ( Smith-Hurd Ann.

Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D.C., and Guernsey Orcutt, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for appellants.\n Messrs. Donald C. Power, f Columbus Ohio, August G. Gutheim, of Washington, D.C., and John W. Bricker, of Columbus, Ohio, for appellees Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and another.\n Mr. Don Rose, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for appellee Pittsburgh Coal Co.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio directs the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Erir Railroad Company, appellants in this court, to adhere to local or intrastate rates in switching and delivering four carloads of bituminous coal to consignees in Youngstown, Ohio, and in switching and delivering any other carloads that may be tendered hereafter in similar conditions. The question is whether the effect of such an order as applied to the transactions exhibited in the record is to regulate common carriers by rail in the business of interstate transportation, and thus to trench upon the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Pittsburgh Coal Company, an appellee in this court, is the owner of coal mines in Pennsylvania, so situated that the product of the mines can readily be conveyed by use of the owner's cars and tipple to barges waiting to receive it on the Monongahela river. Much of the coal is sold to consumers in Ohio. The company has its own barges in which the coal is towed by its own tug boats, first over the Monongahela river and then over the Ohio, to Smith's Ferry, Pennsylvania. There it has its own right of way, with tracks and cars and engine. The coal, when transferred from the barges to the cars, is taken over this right of way, a distance of about eleven miles, to Negley, Ohio. At Negley, or near by, is the \n\n[298 U.S. 170, 172]\n\u00a0\n Brush River Plant, owned by the coal company, where the coal is dumped from the cars, washed, freed from foreign matter and impurities, and broken up or assorted into the sizes desired by the customers. Then for the first time it is ready for shipment to fill specific orders, which often are not received until after it has left the mines. Up to that point the carriage has been solely by a private carrier, making use of its own facilities, its trains and tugs and barges.\n At Negley the coal after being put in shape for sale is loaded upon the cars of the Pittsburgh, Lisbon & Western Railroad Company, referred to in the record as Lisbon, for transportation to consignees at Youngstown or elsewhere. Lisbon is a common carrier by rail, which connects at Signal, Ohio, with the tracks of the Youngstown & Suburban Railroad Company, referred to in the record as the Y. & S. The route of that line, about 22. 2 miles, is between Signal and Youngstown, where there are interchange facilities with the Pennsylvania and the Erie.\n On September 17, 1934, Lisbon received from the Pittsburgh Coal Company at Negley four carloads of bituminous coal to be transported via the Y. & S. to Youngstown, the cars to be there transferred, first to the Pennsylvania and then to the Erie, for delivery to consignees in Youngstown identified in the shipping orders. Lisbon and Y. & S. followed these instructions. Upon tender of the cars at the proper interchange track, Pennsylvania refused to accept or switch them except upon payment of the road haul charges on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The switching rates prescribed by the state commission were $7.65 per car, a charge which covered the intermediate service of the Pennsylvania and the delivery service of the Erie. No switching rates for such traffic had been filed with the federal commission by any of the trunk lines, but the haul charges, calcu- \n\n[298 U.S. 170, 173]\n\u00a0\n lated to the next destination beyond, were $94.50 per car. Upon the rejection of the four carloads, the Pennsylvania gave written notice to the Y. & S. that thereafter carloads of bituminous coal from mines outside Ohio would not be accepted for delivery within the Youngstown switching limits until all charges were prepaid at rates published in the tariffs on file with the federal commission.\n Following the receipt of this notice, the . & S. filed with the Ohio Commission its complaint against the Pennsylvania and the Erie, the two companies having acted in concert in demanding the higher rates. Other lines, including the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, and the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Company, intervened in the proceedings, as did also the Pittsburgh Coal Company. After a full hearing the commission held in a careful opinion that in the circumstances stated the state of Ohio had jurisdiction by its commission to regulate the charges for switching services at Youngstown, and that the rates thereby prescribed were binding on the carriers. An order was made accordingly. This order was sustained by a District Court of three judges, application having been made for relief by injunction both interlocutory and final. Judicial Code  266, 28 U.S.C.  380 (28 U.S.C.A.  380). The case is here upon appeal. Ibid.\n First. The transportation of the coal from Negley, Ohio, to Youngstown in the same state, was an intrastate service, not subject to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, and its character in that regard was not changed because of preliminary carriage from the Pennsylvania mines in barges and cars belonging to the shipper.\n Appellants say that from the moment the coal left the mines in Pennsylvania there was a continuing intention to deliver it to consumers in another state, whether their identity at the beginning was known or unknown, and \n\n[298 U.S. 170, 174]\n\u00a0\n that a movement impelled by that intention is interstate commerce which Congress has the power to regulate at any stage of the ensuing transit. Baltimore & Ohio S.W.R. Co. v. Settle, \n260 \nU.S. 166, 173\n, 43 S.Ct. 28; Railroad Commission of Ohio v. Worthington, \n225 \nU.S. 101, 108\n, 32 S.Ct. 653; Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific States Paper Association, \n273 \nU.S. 52, 64\n, 47 S.Ct. 255. But there is confusion of thought in such a statement of the problem. Not all commerce is transportation, and not all transportation is by common carriers by rail. The question for us here is not whether the movement of the coal is to be classified as commerce or even as commerce between states. The question is whether it is that particular form of interstate commerce which Congress has subjected to regulation in respect of rates by a federal commission. The Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.  1 et seq. ( 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.)) is aimed at common carriers exclusively (section 1(1, 3), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(1, 3), and not even at all these. With exceptions plainly unrelated to this case (section 1(1)(b, c), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(1)(b, c) carriers, even though common, are unaffected by the act unless they are carriers wholy be railroad, or if partly by railroad and partly by water, are operating under 'a common control, management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment.' Section 1(1)(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(1)(a). Cf. Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 184\n, 16 S.Ct. 700; Louisville & N.R. Co. v. Behlmer, \n175 \nU.S. 648\n, 20 S.Ct. 209; Standard Oil Co. v. United States (C. C.A.) 179 F. 614; Mutual Transit Co. v. United States (C.C.A.) 178 F. 664. There are limitations, moreover, in respect of the conduct to be controlled in addition to the foregoing limitations in respect of the carriers to be regulated. Even though the activities are those of common carriers by rail, the statute does not apply 'to the transportation of passengers or property ... wholly within one State and not shipped to or from a foreign country from or to any place in the United States.' Section 1(2)(a, b) 49 U.S.C.A.  1(2)(a, b). For many purposes, as for example in testing the validity of state taxation, merchandise is deemed \n\n[298 U.S. 170, 175]\n\u00a0\n to be in interstate commerce when it has started on its journey, though still in the possession of consignor or seller. Hughes Bros. Timber Co. v. Minnesota, \n272 \nU.S. 469, 475\n, 47 S.Ct. 170; Champlain Realty Co. v. Brattleboro, \n26 \nU.S. 366\n, 43 S.Ct. 146, 25 A.L.R. 1195. Not so, however, in determining the application of this act. Transportation begins for that purpose, if not for others, when the merchandise has been placed in the possession of a carrier. Hughes Bros. Timber Co. v. Minnesota, supra; Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517, 528\n, 6 S.Ct. 475; Diamond Match Co. v. Ontonagon, \n188 \nU.S. 82, 95\n, 23 S. Ct. 266; Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 498, 527\n, 31 S.Ct. 279. And 'wherever the word 'carrier' is used in this chapter it shall be held to mean 'common carrier.\" Section 1(3), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(30).\n With the aid of these definitions the problem before us takes on a new simplicity. The only transportation of this coal by a common carrier of merchandise either by railroad or by water was intrastate transportation in Ohio between Negley and Youngstown. The transportation between Pennsylvania and Ohio was by the owner, who was not a common carrier, but furnished implements of carriage for its own use exclusively. Appellants would have us hold that this interstate transportation by an owner who does not carry for any one else will be tacked to the intrastate transportation by railroads who are in business as common carriers, and the movement thus consolidated brought within the statute. The statute and the decisions as we read them forbid this unifying process. The Pipe Line Case (U.S. v. Ohio Oil Co.), \n234 \nU.S. 548, 562\n, 34 S.Ct. 956; McCluskey v. Marysville & Northern R.

The haul from Hoboken to Garfield was held to be subject to regulation by the federal commission. The case differs from the one at hand in at least three particulars: (1) The carriage to Hoboken, as will appear from an examination of the record, was effected by a common carrier; (2) the ultimate consignee was known from the beginning; (3) the rail transportation was 'in fact a part of foreign commerce.' U.S. v. Erie R. Co., \n280 U.S. 98\n, at page 102, 50 S.Ct. 51, 53. Upon a shipment of merchandise to or from a foreign country, the Interstate Commerce Act applies to the carriage in this country, though that part of the carriage is within the limits of a single state. Section 1(1)(c), (2)(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(1)(c), (2) (a). Cf. Denver & Rio Grande R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission (Com.Ct.) 195 F. 968, 972; Oregon-Washington R. & Navigation Co. v. Strauss & Co. (C.C.A.) 73 F.(2d) 912; Lees & Sons Co. v. Reading Co., 148 I.C.C. 603; In re Transportation of Sugar, 22 I.C.C. 558.\n Texas & New Orleans Railway Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., supra, though differing in details from the case of the Erie Railway, illustrates the same principle, and is to be distinguished on like grounds.\n Neither in the cases cited by the appellants nor in any others known to us has transportation by a common carrier been combined with carriage by an owner for the purpose of subjecting the whole to the operation of the statute when the parts would be exempt. Such a fusion, if permitted, would lead to strange results. The situation laid before us would not be changed in its essentials if a co-operative association of farmers doing busine  in Pennsylvania close to the state line were to use a fleet of trucks belonging to the association or its members to \n\n[298 U.S. 170, 177]\n\u00a0\n carry milk or vegetables from Pennsylvania to a railroad station in Ohio. Even though this were done systematically and not casually or in sporadic instances, the ensuing transportation by rail, if kept within Ohio, would not be transportation between the states within the meaning of the act of Congress. If the concept of transportation is in need of expansion, it is for the legislative department of the government to determine how great the change shall be.\n We have found it unnecessary to consider in the disposition of the case whether the treatment of the coal at Negley would break the continuity of the movement from the mines, even if interstate transportation would otherwise exist. Cf. Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, supra, \n219 U.S. 498\n, at page 526, 31 S.Ct. 279; Alabama Great Southern R. Co. v. George H. McFadden & Bros.

The appellants have woven into their brief a suggestion, not contained in their statement of points relied upon for reversal, that the ownership by the coal company of a controlling interest in the shares of the Lisbon and the Y. & S. has a bearing on the nature of the transit between Negley and the mines. There is insinuation, if not argument, that in building and operating a private right of way the coal company has nullified restraints imposed upon the railroads by the federal commission, and for that reason must be treated as if it were a common carrier itself.\n No such point was made in the complaint, nor do the assignments of error present it adequately here.\n The decree should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEP BOYS, MANNY, MOE & JACK, OF CALIFORNIA, v.

Knox, of El Dorado, Ark., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 629, 631]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee sued the Phillips Petroleum Company and J. H. Myers in an Arkansas court to recover damages for injuries suffered by him while working fr that company. There was a trial by jury. It gave plaintiff a verdict in accordance with which the court entered judgment against both defendants for $50,000. On appeal to the State Supreme Court, the guaranty company became surety on a supersedeas bond. That court reduced the judgment to $30,000 and held plaintiff entitled to recover that amount from the petroleum company and the surety.\n The petroleum company is a Delaware corporation authorized to do business in Arkansas and engaged in that state in the production and transportation of oil. Crawford and Moses' Digest of the Arkansas Statutes ,  7137, enacted March 8, 1907, declares that all corporations shall be liable for injuries sustained by any employee resulting from negligence of any other employee. \n1\n The Arkansas Constitution, art. 12,  6, provides: 'Corporations may be formed under general laws, which \n\n[297 U.S. 629, 632]\n\u00a0\n laws may, from time to time, be altered or repealed. The General Assembly shall have the power to alter, revoke or annul any charter of incorporation now existing and revocable at the adoption of this Constitution, or any that may hereafter be created, whenever, in their opinion, it may be injurious to the citizens of the State, in such manner, however, that no injustice shall be done to the corporators.' As to domestic corporations the Supreme Court has repeatedly held section 7137 to be a reasonable exertion of the state's power to prescribe the terms of charters of corporations organized under its laws. \n2\n The State Constitution authorizes admission of foreign corporations to do business in the state and declares that, as to contracts made or business there done, they shall be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as like corporations of that state. Article 12,  11. In this case the state court, in harmony with earlier decisions,3 held that section 7137 applies to a foreign corporation carrying on business in Arkansas.\n The substance of the cause of action alleged is this: April 5, 1934, plaintiff and Myers were fellow servants in the service of the petroleum company. They and other employees were engaged in laying pipe. Plaintiff was injured while he and Myers were carrying a length of pipe. Plaintiff, his back toward Myers, had the forward end upon his shoulder; Myers had the other end \n\n[297 U.S. 629, 633]\n\u00a0\n and, while shifting the pipe from one shoulder to the other, negligently jerked it and threw plaintiff to the ground and injured him. The court charged that, if plaintiff's injuries were caused by the negligence of Myers, the verdict should be for plaintiff against both defendants. That instruction was in accordance with section 7137 and the verdict and judgment depend upon it. The sole question is whether by that section the state denies to the petroleum company the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Appellant does not suggest discrimination between foreign and domestic corporations or between it and any other corporation. The section by its terms extends to all corporations whether organized in Arkansas or elsewhere. Undoubtedly the power of the state to prescribe the rule of liability as one of the conditions for the admission of foreign corporations is not less than its power to include the rule in the charters of domestic corporations. Appellant's position is the same as, in like circumstances, would be that of an Arkansas corporation. Its complaint is that the state makes corporations liable for personal injuries sustained by an employee through negligence of any other employee while as to individual employers it leaves in force the common-law rule that every servant assumes the risk of injuries through the negligence of his fellow servants.\n We shall first consider whether consistently with the equal protection clause the state, by exertion of its power to specify provisions of charters of corporations organized under its laws and to impose conditions for the admission of foreign corporations, may prescribe the challenged rule of liability. If, by specifying the terms upon which corporations may be organized under its laws or by the exertion of the reserved power to amend corporate charters, the state may impose the challenged \n\n[297 U.S. 629, 634]\n\u00a0\n rule upon domestic corporations, then the petroleum company is subject to the same rule. Arkansas Constitution, art. 12,  11. And, as unquestionably power to prescribe the terms of corporate charters is at least as great as that reserved to change them, the validity of the provision of section 7137 here in question may be tested as if, by the use of reserved power to amend, it was added to the charter of an Arkansas corporation.\n Arkansas might have refrained from enactment of statutes creating or authorizing organization of corporations and might have denied to foreign corporations admission to the state. But it may not enforce any p rt of the charter of a domestic corporation or any provision of its laws relating to admission of a foreign corporation that is repugnant to the Federal Constitution. \n4\n If section 7137 is repugnant to the equal protection clause, it is without force as a part of the charter contract or otherwise.\n The reservation of power to amend is a part of the contract between the state and the corporation and therefore section 10 of article 1 of the Federal Constitution does not apply. The reserved power is not unlimited and cannot be exerted to defeat the purpose for which the corporate powers were granted, or to take property without compensation, or arbitrarily to make alterations that are inconsistent with the scope and object of the charter \n\n[297 U.S. 629, 635]\n\u00a0\n or to destroy or impair any vested property right. \n5\n On the other hand, it extends to any alteration or amendment 'which will not defeat or substantially impair the object of the grant, or any right vested under the grant, and which the legislature may deem necessary to carry into effect the purpose of the grant, or to protect the rights of the public or of the corporation, its stockholders or creditors, or to promote the due administration of its affairs.' \n6\n As the state may not surrender or bind itself not to exert its police power to guard the safety of workers, the common-law fellow-servant rule may be abrogated by statute even when included in the charter of a corporation. \n7\n But we accept the state's determination that the provision of section 7137 here involved is a part of the charters of corporations organized in Arkansas since its enactment and that, through the power to alter or amend, it is included in the charters of corporations earlier organized under the laws of that state.\n Essential to a just consideration of appellant's contention is a definite understanding of what is denied to it by the construction put upon section 7137 by the State Supreme Court. It was, as described by that court in an earlier case, 'the common-law rule that a servant assumes the \n\n[297 U.S. 629, 636]\n\u00a0\n risk of negligence of his fellow servant.' \n8\n That assumption, like the assumption of other risks incident to the employee's work, is an implied one and constitutes a part of the contract of employment. The section as construed below operates merely to negative the implication, to eliminate that term of the contract and, in its stead, to insert in charters of corporations the rule that they shall be liable for injuries suffered by an employee through negligence of another employee. It merely substitutes the rule of respondeat superior for the common-law fellow-servant rule. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The power reserved by the State Constitution to the general assembly 'to alter, revoke or annul' any charter of incorporation is not a general authorization. Amendment may only be made whenever in the opinion of the general assembly the charter 'may be injurious to the citizens of this state' and then only 'in such manner, however, that no injustice shall be done to the corporators.' The enactment of section 7137 necessarily implies legislative determinations in accordance with these requirements. There is nothing in the record or of which judicial notice may be taken to negative the conclusions of the general assembly upon the matters specified or to show that the distinction made by the statute is a groundless and arbitrary discrimination against corporations. For aught that appears, conditions in Arkansas do not warrant belief that enforcement of the common-law fellow-servant rule as to employees' claims for damages \n\n[297 U.S. 629, 637]\n\u00a0\n on account of personal injuries suffered by them in the service of employers other than those covered by section 7137 might be injurious to citizens of the state or that the abrogation of the rule would not be unjust to that class of employers. And justly, we think, it may be assumed that, if in Arkansas there existed facts sufficient to constitute the specified bases for legislative action in accordance with the constitutional provision, the general assembly would have abrogated the follow-servant rule and extended the one made by section 7137 to all employers. It is therefore plain that the legislative determinations required by the Constitution and presumably made by the general assembly adequately support the challenged classification and that as construed by the State Supreme Court in this case the statute is not repugnant to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n We need not decide the question whether, independently of the reserved power to amend charters and of the bases for legislative action upon which the State Constitution conditions alterations, the provisions of section 7137 under consideration may be sustained as not repugnant to the equal protection clause.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Hereafter all railroad companies operating within this State, whether incorporated or not, and all corporations of every kind and character, and every company whether incorporated or not, engaged in the mining of coal, who may empl y agents, servants or employees, such agents, servants or employees being in the exercise of due care, shall be liable to respond in damages for injuries or death sustained by any such agent, employee or servant, resulting from the careless omission of duty or negligence of such employer, or which may result from the carelessness, omission of duty or negligence of any other agent, servant or employee of the said employer, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the carelessness, omission of duty or negligence causing the injury or death was that of the employer.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Ozan Lumber Co. v.

NATIONAL CITY BANK OF NEW YORK(1936)\nNo. 114\nArgued: Decided: January 6, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 497, 498]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Carl A. Mead and Harry W. Forbes, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The National City Bank of New York is organized under the National Banking Act, as amended from time to time since its enactment. In 1930 the bank, after complying with the requirements of section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act of December 23, 1913, c. 6, 38 Stat. 251, 273, as amended September 7, 1916, c. 461, 39 Stat. 752, 755 (12 U.S.C.A.  601), \n\n[296 U.S. 497, 499]\n\u00a0\n infra, established branches at Manila and Cebu in the Philippine Islands. A tax was levied by and paid to the Philippine government on the net income of these branches for the first six months of the year 1931 (R.S.  5219, as amended (12 U.S.C.A.  548)),1 about which there is no controversy. The Philippine government, however, in addition, levied capital and deposit taxes not permitted by section 5219, and, these having been paid by the bank under protest, this action was brought in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover the amount. That court gave judgment in favor of the bank for only a part of the additional taxes; but the Philippine Supreme Court, upon appeal, reversed the judgment in so far as it was against the bank, and ordered a refund of the entire amount.\n Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, supra, reproduced in the margin so far as it is pertinent here,2 \n\n[296 U.S. 497, 500]\n\u00a0\n authorizes the establishment of branches of national-banking associations 'in foreign countries or dependencies of the United States.' It cannot be doubted that, viewing this section without regard to later legislation, the branches here in question were lawfully established; for, as will appear at a later point in this opinion, the Philippine Islands are included by the words 'dependencies of the United States.' In that view of the matter, the additional taxes imposed by the Philippine government are invalid under Domenech v. National City Bank, \n29 \nU.S. 199, 204\n, 55 S.Ct. 366; Talbott v. Silver Bow County, \n139 \nU.S. 438\n, 11 S.Ct. 594, and, were it not for the asserted effect of legislation subsequent to the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, which we shall examine in a moment, this case would be disposed of, without further detail, upon the authority of those cases. In the Domenech Case we held that the national-banking laws extended to Puerto Rico; that a tax on a branch of a national bank is a tax on the bank; and that Puerto Rico, being a dependency of the United States, could not, except as permitted by R.S.  5219, tax a national bank, since it is an agency of the United States. The Talbott Case involved the power of a territory to impose a tax upon a national bank. This court held, in the first place, that the same power of taxation in respect of national banks exists in the territories as in the states; and, in the second place, that this power of taxation in the territories was limited by the provisions of section 5219 although in terms that section refers only to the states. \n294 \nU.S. 199, 204\n, 55 S.Ct. 366, 369. We find nothing in the original Organic Act or in any of the early statutes relating to the Philippines referred to by petitioner which take those islands out of the controlling rule of the Domenech Case that a 'dependency may not tax its sovereign'; and we come to the only remaining point which we deem it necessary to discuss. \n\n[296 U.S. 497, 501]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner contends that subsequent legislation has the effect of repealing and abrogating section 25 of the 1913 act, permitting the establishment of national bank branches, in so far as the Philippine Islands are concerned. This later legislation consists of certain provisions in the Organic Act for the Philippine Islands of August 29, 1916, c. 416, 39 Stat. 545, and the Act of September 7, 1916, supra, amending designated sections of the original Federal Reserve Act.\n We examine these statutory provisions in their chronological order. By section 25 of the 1913 act, as we have seen, national banks were authorized to establish branches in the Philippine Islands. The Organic Act of 1916 provides:\n'Sec. 5. That the statutory laws of the United States hereafter enacted (subsequent to August 29, 1916), shall not apply to the Philippine Islands, except when they specifically so provide, or it is so provided in this Act (chapter).\n\n'Sec. 6. That the laws now in force in the Philippines (August 29, 1916), shall continue in force and effect, except as altered, amended, or modified herein (by this chapter), until altered, amended, or repealed by the legislative authority herein provided (by this chapter) or by Act of Congress of the United States.' 48 U.S.C.A.  1003, 1004. (Section 6 obviously is to be taken distributively-that is to say, as conferring power on the local legislature to deal only with local laws. It, of course, confers no power on the local legislature to alter, am nd or repeal an act of Congress.)\n\n'Sec. 31. That all laws or parts of laws applicable to the Philippines not in conflict with any of the provisions of this Act are ( hereby) continued in force and effect.' 48 U.S.C.A.  1006\n\n\n\n By sections 6 and 31 it is clear that section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, not being in conflict with any provision of the Organic Act of 1916, was continued in full force and effect. \n\n[296 U.S. 497, 502]\n\u00a0\n September 7, 1916, nine days after the passage of the new Organic Act, the act to amend the Federal Reserve Act, supra, was passed. It, first, is to be observed in respect of this amending act that it does not purport to enact a substitute for the Federal Reserve Act, or to rpeal and reenact any portion, but only to amend certain specific sections thereof. The old act contains thirty sections. The Act of September 7, 1916, amends sections 11, 13, subsection (e) of section 14, the second paragraph of section 16, sections 24 and 25 of Federal Reserve Act, and section 5202 of the Revised Statutes. The introductory words as to section 25 are: 'That section twenty-five be, and is hereby, amended to read as follows.' 39 Stat. 755. The original section is then copied, the only change or addition so far as the question here is concerned, being the insertion of the words 'or insular possessions' after the word 'dependencies.' No reason appears from anything called to our attention, and we are not ourselves aware of any reason, for the addition of these words, since the comprehensive term 'dependencies' would seem to include all insular possessions which we then had. But in any event, the Philippine Islands constituted a dependency, for they were not possessions merely, but possession held by right of cession from Spain and over which the United States undoubtedly had supreme power of legislation and government. See United States v. The Nancy, Fed.Cas.No. 15,854, 3 Wash.C.C. 281, 286 at seq. Compare 34 Op.Attys.Gen. 287, 291. The only substantial change made in the old section 25 is the addition of a provision authorizing a national-banking association to invest in the stock of other banks and corporations chartered or incorporated under the laws of the United States or of any state engaged in international or foreign banking, or banking in dependencies or insular possessions of the United States; and it is fairly plain that this addition constituted the sole reason for amending the section. \n\n[296 U.S. 497, 503]\n\u00a0\n The amending act just described contains no words of repeal; and if it effected a repeal of section 25 of the 1913 act, it did so by implication only. The cardinal rule is that repeals by implication are not favored. Where there are two acts upon the same subject, effect should be given to both if possible. There are two well-settled categories of repeals by implication: (1) Where provisions in the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict, the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one; and (2) if the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute, it will operate similarly as a repeal of the earlier act. But, in either case, the intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest; otherwise, at least as a general thing, the later act is to be construed as a continuation of, and not a substitute for, the first act and will continue to speak, so far as the two acts are the same, from the time of the first enactment.\n The law on the subject as we have just stated it finds abundant support in the decisions of this court, as well as in those of lower federal and state courts. It will be enough to direct attention to a few of these decisions out of a very large number. In United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 92, Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court, after stating the general rule, said that if two acts 'are repugnant in any of their provisions, the latter act, without any repealing clause, operates to the extent of the repugnancy as a repeal of the first, and even where two acts are not in express terms repugnant, yet if the latter act covers the whole subject of the first, and embraces new provisions, plainly showing that it was intended as a substitute for the first act, it will operate as a repeal of that act.' It was not meant by this statement to say, as a casual reading of it might suggest, that the mere fact that the latter act covers the whole subject and embraces new \n\n[296 U.S. 497, 504]\n\u00a0\n provisions demonstrates an intention completely to substitute the latter act for the first. This is made apparent by the decision in Henderson's Tobacco, 11 Wall. 652, 657, at the same term where, in an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Strong, it is said, 'But it must be observed that the doctrine (of the Tynen Case) asserts no more than that the former statute is impliedly repealed, so far as the provisions of the subsequent statute are repugnant to it, or so far as the latter statute, making new provisions, is plainly intended as a substitute for it. Where the powers or directions under several acts are such as may well subsist together, an implication of repeal cannot be allowed.' (Italics are in the original.) These two cases, with others, are briefly reviewed by this court in Red Rock v. Henry, \n106 \nU.S. 596, 601\n, 1 S.Ct. 434, 439, by Mr. Justice Woods, and the court's conclusion stated as follows: 'The result of the authorities cited is that when an affirmative statute contains no expression of a purpose to repeal a prior law, it does not repeal it unless the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict, or unless the later statute covers the whole ground occupied by the earlier and is clearly intended as a substitute for it, and the intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest.'\n The implication of which the cases speak must be a necessary implication. Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342, 362, 363. It is not sufficient, as was said by Mr. Justice Story in that case, 'to establish, that subsequent laws cover some or even all of the cases provided for by (the prior act); for they may be merely affirmative, or cumulative or auxiliary.' The question whether a statute is repealed by a later one containing no repealing clause, on the ground of repugnancy or substitution, is a question of legislative intent to be ascertained by the application of the accepted rules for ascertaining that intention. United States v. Claflin, \n97 U.S. 546\n, 551, Eastern Extension Tel. Co. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 326, 332\n, 34 S.Ct. 57. \n\n[296 U.S. 497, 505]\n\u00a0\n And, even in the face of a repealing clause, circumstances may justify the conclusion that a later act repeating provisions of an earlier one is a continuation, rather than an abrogation and reenactment, of the earlier act. Bear Lake Irrigation Co. v. Garland, \n164 U.S. 1\n, 11-13, 17 S.Ct. 7.\n Petitioner relies on Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 617; but it is sufficient to say that the rule which we have quoted from Red Rock v. Henry, supra, was formulated with that case in mind, since it is specifically mentioned.\n In some of the states, the principle has been embodied in statutes to the general effect that provisions of a prior statute, so far as they are reproduced in a later one, are to be construed as a continuation of such provisions and not as a new enactment. See Barrows v. People's Gaslight & Coke Co. (C.C.) 75 F. 794, 795. But such statutes are only declaratory of the rule of the common law. Dallmann v. Dallmann, 159 Wis. 480, 485, 486, 149 N.W. 137; Julien v. Model B., L. & I. Ass'n, 116 Wis. 79, 89, 90, 92 N. W. 561, 61 L.R.A. 668. See, also, Ely and others v. Holton, 15 N.Y. 595, 598, 599; Moore v. Mausert et al., 49 N.Y. 332, 335; Longlois v. Longlois et al., 48 Ind. 60, 63, 64; People v. New York, C. & St. L.R. Co., 316 Ill. 452, 457, 458, 147 N.E. 494.\n Applying the rule established by the foregoing and other authorities, we see nothing in the terms of he Federal Reserve Amending Act, in the provisions of the new Organic Act, or in the history of Philippine legislation, which justifies the conclusion that by the amendment of 1916 Congress intended to repeal the old section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act. The amendment is made in a well-approved form-a form which, indeed, many of the states compel by constitutional provision-namely, by repeating the language of the original section with the additions to which we have heretofore called attention. Unless the contrary plainly appear, the employment of such form of amendment is simply to serve the causes of con- \n\n[296 U.S. 497, 506]\n\u00a0\n venience and certainty. That is to say, by carrying the full text forward, the task of searching out and bringing together the various fragments which go to make up the completed whole, after specific eliminations or additions by amendment, is rendered unnecessary; and possible doubt as to the precise terms of the law as amended is avoided. Or, as Chief Judge Denio said in Ely and others v. Holton, supra: 'In short, we attribute no effect to the plan of dove-tailing the amendment into the original section, except the one above suggested, of preserving a harmonious text, so that when future editions shall be published the scattered members shall easily adjust themselves to each other.'\n It follows that such parts of the original section 25 as were copied into the amended section were not thereby repealed and immediately reenacted, but continued, uninterruptedly, to be the law after the amendment precisely as they were before. Section 5 of the Organic Act of 1916 (48 U.S.C.A.  1003), supra, which in terms relates only to laws thereafter enacted, must be put aside as not applicable.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 5219, Revised Statutes, as amended (12 U.S.C.

Such application shall specify, in addition to the name and capital of the banking association filing it, the place or places where the banking operations proposed are to be carried on, and the amount of capital set aside for the conduct of its foreign business.

That trial resulted in a verdict against petitioners, and the judgment thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 82 F. (2d) 704, 705. In view of petitioners' contention that the circuit Court of Appeals had misapplied our former opinion, we granted certiorari, October 12, 1936, \n299 \nU.S. 524\n, 57 S.Ct. 14, 81 L.Ed . --.\n In its opinion the Circuit Court of Appeals stated that the evidence on the former trial 'differed little in essential respects' from that in the present record. The court then gave the grounds of its decision as follows:\n'On the former appeal we sustain the District Court's dismissal of the action on the ground that the evidence failed to establish a violation of the sections relied upon. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment, and a new trial followed. On retrial, the duty of the District Court to follow the instructions of the Supreme Court was, of course, clear. It attempted so to do and submitted the case to the jury with the results above stated.\n\n'The parties disagree as to the construction of the Supreme Court decision. Both agree that it controls this appeal.\n\n'Appellants earnestly contend that the evidence in the case fails to show either a conspiracy to restrain interstate commerce or the adoption of unfair or unlawful trade practices by the appellants. This court adopted this view on the previous trial, and the Supreme Court differed with us and reversed the judgment. Appellants \n\n[299 U.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n also argue that the evidence in this case fails to show any recoverable damages suffered by appellee.\n\n'We deem it unnecessary to elaborate the questions so fully discussed in the previous opinions. As we view the question before us it is merely a matter of applying the Supreme Court's decision.\n\n'We accept appellee's version which is that the complaint stated a good cause of action, and, if the facts which the evidence on the trial tended to establish be accepted by the jury as true, then it was justified in finding for appellee. In other words, the arguments which appellants advance do not establish a bar to recovery, but merely challenge the facts and the inferences which support appellee's fact contentions. The result is that a jury question on the issue of damages, restraint of trade, and unfair methods, existed, and the jury settled the fact issues by its verdict. As we construe the decision of the Supreme Court, this conclusion is unavoidable.\n\n'It follows, therefore, that the judgment should be and is hereby affirmed.'\n\n We are unable to escape the conclusion that in holding the evidence sufficient to sustain a verdict for respondent upon the issue of unlawful restraint or practices and consequent injury to respondent, the Circuit Court of Appeals felt itself controlled by our decision. That was a misinterpretation. We expressed no opinion upon that question. On the contrary, after dealing with the question of interstate commerce and holding that it was not necessary that the restraint or monopoly should affect all the business of the kind throughout the country, but might relate to the part of it carried on in a particular section, we said: 'We intimate no opinion whether, upon the question of restraint or monopoly or upon the question of injury to petitioner (respondent here) or its business, the evidence is sufficient to warrant a verdict in its favor.' \n293 U.S. 268\n, at page 281, 55 S.Ct. 182, 186. \n\n[299 U.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n That question, as raised by the present record, should have been determined by the Circuit Court of Appeals upon a consideration of the evidence adduced, untrammeled by any supposed expression upon that point by this Court.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPREMIER-PABST SALES CO. v.

Donnelly and C. J. Lynch, Jr., both of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and J. Wesley McWilliams, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Premier-Pabst Sales Company, a Delaware corporation, is a distributor of beer made in Illinois and Wisconsin. Having secured a license issued under a statute \n\n[298 U.S. 226, 227]\n\u00a0\n of Pennsylvania enacted and amended in 1933 (Act May 3, 1933, P.L. 252, as amended by Act Dec. 20, 1933, Sp.Sess., P.L. 75), it engaged in business there. That statute was again amended by Act No. 398, approved July 18, 1935 (47 P.S.Pa.  84 et seq.), which changed the licensing law so as to discriminate between distributors who sold beer made within the state and those who sold imported beer. The annual license fee of the former was made  400, and the penalty of the bond required of them was set at $1,000; the license fee of the latter was made $900, and the penalty of the bond to be given by them was set at $2,000.\n The company did not apply for a license under the 1935 act. Instead, it filed, in the federal court for Eastern Pennsylvania, this suit against the Liquor Control Board and other state officials. Claiming that the act violated the commerce clause and the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3; art. 4,  2; amend. 14,  1), the bill prayed for a judgment declaring the act void and for an injunction restraining its enforcement. The case was heard before three judges upon application for a preliminary injunction. The facts were stipulated; and it was agreed that the hearing should be deemed also a final hearing upon the application for a permanent injunction. The court denied the injunctions and dismissed the bill as wanting in equity, because the discrimination complained of was authorized by the Twenty- First Amendment. 12 F.Supp. 970. An appeal was allowed.\n We have no occasion to consider the constitutional question, because it appears that the plaintiff is without standing to present it. One who would strike down a state statute as obnoxious to the Federal Constitution must show that the alleged unconstitutional feature injures him. Heald v. District of Columbia, \n259 \nU.S. 114, 123\n, 42 S.Ct. 434. Under the act of 1935, no one may sell beer in Pennsylvania unless duly licensed; and no license may issue to a corporation unless all its officers and directors, and 51 per cent. of its stockholders, have been resi- \n\n[298 U.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n dents of the state for the period of at least two years prior to the application for a license. The constitutional validity of that provision is conceded; and it was agreed that all the officers and directors are, and were when the suit was begun, nonresidents of Pennsylvania, and that all of its stock was, and is, held by another foreign corporation. As no license could legally issue to the company is any event, it cannot be injured by the alleged unconstitutional discrimination; and hence has no standing to challenge provisions of the act.\n The company urges that it has a standing because, if the 1935 act is invalid, the license issued under the act of 1933, as amended, is still in force. The 1933 act also prohibited the issue of a license to a corporation whose officers and directors are nonresidents. The commonwealth insists that the company's officers and directors were nonresidents when it secured its license. The stipulation as to the facts is silent on the subject; and the company argues that we must assume, in favor of the validity of the license, that it was then qualified to receive one. We need not discuss the validity of that contention. For even if the license was valid when issued, the state had the power to terminate it. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n, 8 S.Ct. 273.

The borrower covenanted that the building would conform to plans and specifications, and would be completed not later than December 16, 1930. As part of the same transaction, two surety companies, the respondents in this court, signed a bond in the sum of $3,000,000, indemnifying the lender against loss through the failure of the borrower to construct and pay for a building conforming to the contract, and complete it by the stated time. The bond also provided that in the event of the borrower's default, t e lender, if it so elected, should be at liberty to go forward with the work, and charge the cost against the sureties. Other conditions are believed to be immaterial to any question now before us.\n On December 16, 1930, the borrower made default under the mortgage, abandoning doning the work with the building then unfinished. At that time the petitioner's advances under the building loan agreement were $6,575, 000, the full amount promised, less $75,000 retained by agreement. On December 18, 1930, petitioner through its nominee brought suit in the state court for the foreclosure of the mortgage. On January 6, 1931, it went into possession with the mortgagor's consent. On January 19, 1931, there was a judgment of foreclosure, followed by a sale on March 17, 1931, at which the mortgagee was the buyer, the bid of $6,000,000 being applied upon the mortgage. A deficiency judgment of $716,215.02 was entered the next month.\n Petitioner in possession of the building went on with the unfinished work, bringing it to completion in October, 1931. An action on the bond was then begun against the sureties. The trial court gave judgment for damages in the sum of $798,416.81, made up of three classes of items: \n\n[297 U.S. 198, 205]\n\u00a0\n The cost of completion; the loss from omissions and inferior substitutions; and the interest on investment, together with taxes and insurance charges, while the building was idle because unready for its occupants. (D.C.) 7 F. Supp. 392. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found this award to be excessive. In the view of that court no award should have been made for interest, taxes, or insurance during the period of idleness. Payments necessary to complete the building were properly allowed, for they were evidence of the difference in value between an incomplete and a completed structure. Reparation was also to be made for omissions and substitutions to the extent that they diminished value, unless strict compliance had been waived by the lender or its agents. However, the extent of the recovery was not susceptible of ascertainment without the aid of a new trial. This was so because evidence of waiver had been offered by the surety and erroneously excluded. A remand was thus necessary to elicit all the facts. 77 F.(2d) 834. Before a second trial was had, a writ of certiorari (\n296 \nU.S. 566\n, 56 S.Ct. 123) issued at the instance of petitioner to resolve a claim of conflict between the decision to be reviewed and a decision of this court. Trainor Co. v. AEtna Casualty & Surety Co., \n290 \nU.S. 47\n, 54 S.Ct. 1. The writ states that it is 'limited to the question of the measure of damages,' thus excluding from our consideration the ruling of the court below as to the effect of waiver of performance.\n Limiting our review accordingly, we think the extent of the recovery upon the new trial that will be necessary has been too narrowly confined.\n The petitioner should be placed in the same position it would have occupied if the building had been completed on December 16, 1930. Trainor Co. v. AEtna Casualty & Surety Co., supra, \n290 U.S. 47\n, at pages 54, 55, 54 S.Ct. 1; Kidd v. McCormick, 83 N.Y. 391, 398; Province Securities Corporation v. Maryland Casualty Co., 269 Mass. 75, 94, 168 N.E. 252. To give \n\n[297 U.S. 198, 206]\n\u00a0\n it nothing but the cost of doing the unfinished work, plus the loss resulting from omissions and substitutions, would be a scant measure of reparation, allowing nothing for delay. Ruff v. Rinaldo, 55 N.Y. 664; C. W. Hunt Co. v. Boston Elevated R. Co., 199 Mass. 220, 233, 235, 85 N.E. 446; Sedgwick, Damages (9th Ed.)  645. If performance had been prompt, the mortgagee would have had the security of a finished structure, which a buyer at a foreclosure sale could have utilized at once. During the pendency of the suit, the rents might have been impounded at the hands of a receiver and applied upon the deficiency resulting from the sale. Freedman's Saving & Trust Co. v. Shepherd, \n127 \nU.S. 494, 503\n, 8 S.Ct. 1250, 32 L.E . 163; Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, \n295 \nU.S. 56, 62\n, 55 S.Ct. 555, 97 A.L.R. 905. With the building still unfinished, there were no rents to be collected and hence none to be applied in reduction of the debt. More important still, the amount of any bid was certain to be reduced by notice to the bidders that the building would be unproductive until ready to be occupied. From the point of view of bidders the reduction in value as the consequence of delay would be made up of two factors; the estimated cost of finishing the work, and the estimated carrying charges, not to exceed the rental value, during the period of idleness. Cf. Trainor Co. v. AEtna Casualty & Surety Co., supra, \n290 U.S. 47\n, at page 55, 54 S.Ct. 1; Kidd v. McCormick, supra, 83 N.Y. 391, at page 398. So at least an assessor of the damages might find as a fair inference of fact, even if the finding does not follow as an inference of law. The effect of the decision is to hold down the recovery to the first of these factors and to eliminate the second.\n The petitioner might have relied upon the testimony of experts as to the total depreciation and as to the weight of the component factors. It chose a different method. To show the loss sustained from finishing the work, it proved the actual cost, as by the express provisions of the bond it was at liberty to do. Cf. Comey v. \n\n[297 U.S. 198, 207]\n\u00a0\n United Surety Co., 217 N.Y. 268, 276, 111 N.E. 832, Ann.Cas.1917E, 424; Appleton v. Marx, 191 N.Y. 81, 85, 86, 83 N.E. 563, 16 L.R.A.(N.S.) 210, 14 Ann.Cas. 150. One of the factors of diminished value it has thus established with precision. To fix the weight of the other factor, it would have done better to give evidence by experts of the rental value of such a building at the date of the default and later. Griffin v. Colver, 16 N.Y. 489, 496, 69 Am.Dec. 718; Cassidy v. Le Fevre, 45 N.Y. 562, 567; Witherbee v. Meyer, 155 N.Y. 446, 453, 454, 50 N.E. 58. Instead of doing this, it chose to give evidence of the taxes, insurance premiums, and interest on investment. We are told by the respondents now that for anything appearing in the record the carrying charges may have been greater than any rents that could have been earned if the building had been finished. No such objection was made upon the trial. We think it comes too late when first made upon appeal. In the absence of more specific challenge, the trier of the facts might not improperly assume that interest on the investment along with taxes and insurance were losses flowing from the failure to receive a finished building. New York & Colorado Mining Syndicate & Co. v. Fraser, \n130 \nU.S. 611, 622\n, 623 S., 9 S.Ct. 665. The point will not be labored, for the assumption is a safe one that evidence and objection will not be subject to this criticism when the case is tried again.\n A question is raised as to the form of the complaint. The respondents insist that its allegations are insufficient to permit proof of loss of rents in addition to the cost. We read the pleading otherwise. In the circumstances of this case, loss of rents is to be reckoned as general, not special, damage. Sedgwick, Damages (9th Ed.)  1261; Griffin v. Colver, supra; Cassidy v. Le Fevre, supra; Ruff v. Rinaldo, supra; Jutte v. Hughes, 67 N.Y. 267, 271. It is one of the factors contributing to and measuring the diminished worth of the security. Damages when general are recoverable under a pleading that does not \n\n[297 U.S. 198, 208]\n\u00a0\n enumerate the items. Armstrong v. Percy, 5 Wend. (N.Y.) 535, 536, 538, 539; Laraway v. Perkins, 10 N.Y. 371, 373. Here the complaint alleges that except for the default and in particular the delay, the plaintiff would have obtained upon foreclosure the full amount of principal and interest due upon the mortgage; it alleges that through the same causes the value of the mortgage was impaired to the extent of the deficiency judgment; it alleges that the plaintiff has thereby been deprived of any and all return on the amount of the investment. We find these llegations broad enough to let in evidence of damages along the lines that have been marked.\n Another trial will permit the petitioner to show more accurately than it has done upon the record now before us that the building was continuously untenantable until the completion of the work and that the time taken for completion did not outrun the bounds of reason.\n What was ruled by the Court of Appeals in respect of the scope of the recovery for omissions and substitutions was not specified as error in the petition for the writ, and will be assumed to be correct. Zellerbach Paper Co. v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 172, 182\n, 55 S.Ct. 127; Helvering v. Taylor, \n293 \nU.S. 507, 511\n, 55 S.Ct. 287; Clark v. Williard, \n294 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 55 S.Ct. 356, 98 A.L.R. 347.\n The judgment is modified by a direction that the measure of damages upon a new trial shall be that defined in this opinion, and as thus modified affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF PUERTO RICO v. HAVEMEYER(1936)\nNo. 115\nArgued: Decided: January 6, 1936\n\n\n Havemeyer \n296 U.S. 506\n (1936) ]\n\n\n[296 U.S. 506, 508]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D.C. (Benjamin J. Horton, of San Juan, P.R., and Nathan R. Margold, of Washington, D.C., on the brief), for petitioner.\n Mr. Ralph S. Rounds, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n March 19, 1901, the executive council of Puerto Rico granted to the Guanica Land Company, a New Jersey corporation, assignable franchises including the privilege to take water from Guanica Lake for the irrigation of the company's lands. Russell & Co., Sucesores, Sociedad en Comandita, a limited civil agricultural partnership composed of Havemeyer and the other respondents as partners, succeeded to that privilege. March 8, 1929, the Public Service Commission of Puerto Rico made an order canceling it. The District Court of San Juan and the Supreme Court successively sustained the order. Respond- \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 509]\n\u00a0\n ents' final appeal was to the Circuit Court of Appeals; it held the order unreasonable, reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court, and remanded the case for further proceedings. 74 F.(2d) 637.\n Notwithstanding absence of cross-petition, we may consider respondents' insistence that the commission was without authority to make the order. Langnes v. Green, \n282 U.S. 531\n, 536-538, 51 S.Ct. 243. The petition presents two questions: Whether the Circuit Court of Appeals, a constitutional court of the United States, has jurisdiction to review the commission's order; whether the six individual respondents here are parties in interest entitled to appeal. There is another question adequately raised by the petition though not specified formally as are the others or presented in accordance with the best practice. It is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding the order to be unreasonable and in reversing upon that ground the judgment of the Supreme Court.\n The Organic Act of 1900, c. 191, 31 Stat. 77, 81, authorized the creation of an executive council, section 18, and provided: 'That all grants of franchises, rights, and privileges or concessions of a public or quasi-public nature shall be made by the executive council, with the approval of the governor, and all franchises granted in Porto Rico shall be reported to Congress, which hereby reserves the power to annul or modify the same.' Section 32, 31 Stat. 83. The Joint Resolution of May 1, 1900,  3, 31 Stat. 716 (see 48 U.S.C.A.  752) required that all such grants 'shall provide that the same shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal.'\n The franchise, in addition to conferring the privilege of using the water of Guanica Lake for irrigation of their lands, authorized the grantees to construct a wharf in, and to build and operate a railroad along, the harbor of Guanica Bay into which flow the waters of the lake. The irrigation privilege is the only one here involved; its substance follows: The grant was for 99 years and extended \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 510]\n\u00a0\n to the land company, its successors, and assigns. They were authorized to construct and operate a dam across the outlet for the purpose of regulating the flow of the water from the lake. They were given the right to take up to 20,000,000 gallons a day from the outlet or elsewhere, by gravity, through channels or by pumps, and to construct and operate works therefor. The franchise declared that nothing therein should be construed to permit grantees to raise or maintain the height of the lake above its customary level during the rainy season in years of average and usual rainfall, and they were declared liable for all damage sustained by abutting owners by reason of unduly raising the waters. They were authorized to acquire by eminent domain private lands needed for their works, and were required to have plans for the same approved by the Commissioner of the Interior before commencing work. They were required to pay $300 per year for the irrigation privilege, and in case of default the Commissioner might stop the flow of the water. It was provided: 'That the franchises, privileges and concessions hereby granted, shall be subject to amendment, alteration or repeal.'\n The Second Organic Act, approved March 2, 1917, c. 145, 39 Stat. 951 ( see 48 U.S.C.A.  731 et seq.) declares the authority of the Legislature shall extend 'to all matters of a legislative character not locally inapplicable,' section 37 (48 U.S.C.A.  821) but expressly reserves to Congress the power to annul acts of the Legislature. Section 34 (48 U.S.C. A.  826). The act also creates a Public Service Commission and declares that all grants of franchises, rights, and privileges of a public or quasi public nature shall be made by it, but not to be effective until approved by the Governor and to be subject to the power of Congress 'to annul or modify the same.' Section 38 (48 U.S.C.A.  750). It requires such grants to provide that they shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal. Section 39 (48 U.S.C.A.  752). Section 38 was by section 6, Act of March 4, 1927, amended to empower and direct the commission to discharge such additional duties and functions as might be conferred upon it by the Legislature. 44 Stat. 1420 (48 U.S.C.A.  750). \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 511]\n\u00a0\n The Laws of Puerto Rico, 1917, Act No. 70, requires that all grants of franchises shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the commission (section 54), and declares that it shall have power to alter, amend, modify, or repeal any franchise that may have been granted by the executive council, and shall exercise all the rights and powers reserved to the executive council by any such franchise or privilege or by any law. Section 60.\n Act No. 70 also regulates the commission's procedure and the appeals from its orders. The testimony before the commission must be taken down. Section 68. Any party to the proceedings thereby affected may appeal from its orders to the District Court of San Juan. Petitions for appeals include assignments of errors. Section 78. The commission is brought in as party defendant; upon the filing of its answer, the case is at issue. The commission is required to certify to the court its proceedings including the testimony, findings, opinions, and orders. Sections 79-82. No evidence may be taken on appeal. Section 86. The court is required to determine whether the order appealed from is reasonable and in accordance with law. Section 83. If found to be so, the court must dismiss the appeal and affirm the order. If found unreasonable, or based pon incompetent evidence or otherwise not in conformity with law, the court must reverse the order or remand to the commission. Section 85. A party aggrieved by the final judgment of the District Court may appeal to the Supreme Court in the same manner and form as in other cases. Section 90. Appeal from the judgment of that court is to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Judicial Code,  128(a) (Fourth). 28 U.S.C.  225(a) (Fourth) 28 U.S.C.A.  225(a) (Fourth). The Attorney General is required, upon request of the commission, to proceed by mandamus, injunction, or quo warranto to enforce the commission's orders. Section 94.\n February 24, 1928, the municipality of Lajas complained to the commission and to the Commissioner of the \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 512]\n\u00a0\n Interior that the works of the holders of the irrigation privilege were causing irreparable damage by raising waters of the lake above the levels specified in the franchise, and thereby flooding privately-owned lands and public roads. The Commissioner investigated and to the Governor reported: Apparently the situation was created by violation of the provisions of the franchise. The holders failed to submit plans as required. The customary levels of the lake mentioned in the franchise have not been determined. The company has borne none of the damages. There was sufficient cause top request the commission to consider repealing the franchise. The Governor referred the report to the commission. It called on the parties interested to show cause why it should not totally cancel the franchise.\n The South Porto Rico Sugar Company, interested in other privileges, and Russell & Co., holder of the irrigation privilege, appeared specially and objected to the jurisdiction of the commission. Before answering the rule to show cause, they brought a suit in the United States Court for Puerto Rico to enjoin the commission from asserting any jurisdiction over them in respect of the franchise. The court dismissed the bill on the grounds that the suit was premature and that the commission had jurisdiction. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. South Porto Rico Sugar Company v. Munoz, 28 F.(2d) 820.\n Russell & Co., by its answer to the order to show cause, admits that the water of the lake has been higher than the usual level and has flooded some lands, asserts that it was not raised by the fault of any owners of the franchise, alleges that the holders have spent large sums for works for the taking of water and that cancellation would cause it great loss, maintains that the commission has no jurisdiction over it, and says that, although the partnership had no obligation so to do, it has (since the order to show cause) at its own expense taken steps to \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 513]\n\u00a0\n lower the waters of the lake to, and also to guarantee that in the future they will not go beyond, customary levels.\n Shortly after this answer was interposed, the commission, upon consideration of conditions then existing in and near the flooded area, found partial drainage to be immediately feasible and, by an interlocutory order, called on the holders of the irrigation privilege to prepare a draft of works to lower the level of the lake in order to relieve the overflowed district. The record before us discloses no response or action by the holders.\n There was a hearing upon the issues raised by the order to show cause and the answers filed by interested parties. Russell & Co. appeared and was heard; much evidence was received. The commission canceled the franchise, but only in respect of the irrigation privilege. The report made by the president of the commission show: The holders of the irrigation privilege controlled the lands through which the water had been accustomed to flow from the lake to the bay. They allowed to accumulate in the outlet soil and de bris, for a distance of 100 yards or more, which held back the waters and caused overflow on an opposite side of the lake. From about the middle of 1926 until late in 1928, the waters so raised continued to flood thou ands of acres including entire farms and 7 or 8 kilometers of public roads in the Lajas Valley and so caused damage to private owners and to the community in general.\n The District Court deemed itself required to decide only whether the order was reasonable and in accordance with law. There was no claim that it rested on incompetent evidence. Upon the record of proceedings, including the evidence introduced before the commission, it held: Under the franchise the holders of the irrigation privilege assumed control of the flow from the lake through the outlet to the bay and had power to raise or lower the level of the waters. They failed to comply with the duty, \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 514]\n\u00a0\n voluntarily contracted by them in accepting the franchise, to submit plans of their works to the Commissioner for approval. From July, 1926, appellants caused or permitted an excess of water to be held in the lake raising it to heights above the customary levels in years of average rainfall and thereby flooded thousands of acres and caused injury to landowners and to the community in general. The order is reasonable and agreeable to law. The court gave judgment dismissing the appeal and affirming the order.\n Respondents took the case upon the same record to the Supreme Court. It construed the franchise not only to prohibit grantees from causing the water to be raised above the indicated levels, but also to require them to prevent its exceeding such levels, and to that end imposed upon them the duty to keep the outlet open. It held that, 'inasmuch as appellant has failed to comply with the conditions of the franchise,' the commission's order was reasonable and in accordance with law, and affirmed the judgment of the District Court.\n On the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the evidence was omitted from the record. That court, assuming that it was sufficient to support a finding that the holders of the irrigation privilege knowingly permitted obstruction in the outlet to raise the level of the lake, concluded that the order canceling the privilege was 'an arbitrary and unreasonable act,' and reversed the judgment.\n\n 1. \nFirst to be considered is respondents' insistence that the commission was not authorized to cancel the irrigation privilege.\n That contention has been overruled by both insular courts and the Circuit Court of Appeals on the authority of South Porto Rico Sugar Co. v. Munoz, supra. While, as to the privilege in question, the original grantee or subsequent holders are not public utilities, the franchise is one of a quasi public nature. The holders' right to take \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 515]\n\u00a0\n the waters depended upon a grant from the public. Civil Code of Puerto Rico,  341, 343, 344. They were endowed with power of eminent domain to acquire in invitum lands of others to enable them conveniently to irrigate their lands and effectively to discharge the duties imposed upon them by the franchise. The terms of the grant were a matter of general concern inasmuch as the use of lands, condition of roads, and health of people in the vicinity were liable to be adversely affected if the holders of the privilege should permit the waters to overflow contiguous areas.\n Implied in every grant of franchise is the condition that it may be lost by misuse. Every such special privilege is subject to termination for breach of condition, whether express or implied, upon which the grant depends. It may be canceled or withdrawn by any procedure that is not repugnant to the established principles of justice. The initial step need not be a suit for mandamus, quo warranto, injunction, or the like. Essential requirements are satisfied if the withdrawal of the privilege, declared by legislative or executive authority, may be followed by appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction in which the rights of the holders may be determined. New York Electric Lines Co. v. Empire City Subway Co., \n235 \nU.S. 179, 194\n, 35 S.Ct. 72; Cosmopolitan Club v. Virginia, \n208 \nU.S. 378, 383\n, 28 S.Ct. 394; New Orleans Wat rworks Co. v. Louisiana, \n185 \nU.S. 336, 346\n, 22 S.Ct. 691; Eagle Insurance Company v. Ohio, \n153 \nU.S. 446, 454\n, 14 S.Ct. 868; Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Needles, \n113 \nU.S. 574, 580\n, 5 S.Ct. 681; Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch, 43, 51.\n The assertion by Congress of power to 'annul and modify' franchises granted by the commission and to annul laws enacted by the insular Legislature gives rise to no implication that the reserved power was intended to be withheld from insular authorities. Inference to the contrary is a more reasonable one and in harmony with the reasons which underlie the reservation. Local authorities \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 516]\n\u00a0\n may ascertain facts and decide questions upon which depends appropriate exertion of the power much more conveniently than may the Congress.\n Under the Organic Acts and insular laws, the power of the commission to make the order in question is clear. And that is so whether the cancellation was accomplished by exertion of the power to amend, alter, and repeal expressly reserved, or was effected under the implied rule that such franchises are terminable for breach of condition. Congress has not directly empowered the commission or any other insular authority to exert the reserved power. But it has adequately empowered the insular Legislature and created a Public Service Commission in which it vested the functions in respect of franchises that theretofore had been discharged by the executive council. The insular Legislature by enactment, obviously not locally inapplicable, empowered the commission to alter, amend, modify, or repeal any franchise granted by the executive council. Section 60, Act No. 70 of 1917. That authorization unquestionably extends to the cancellation of the irrigation privilege.\n\n 2. \nPetitioner maintains that the judicial power of the United States does not extend to the review of reasonableness of the commission's order, and that therefore the Circuit Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction of the appeal. It assumes that the making of the order was merely the exertion of the power to repeal that is expressly reserved in the grant. It says that here involved is a question of the kind of reasonableness of a purely executive decision to exercise a contractual right of the government, and that it is a wholly different kind of question of reasonableness from that involved in the exercise of a power to cancel a franchise where may arise a judicial question whether executive action is confiscatory. And on that basis the commission insists that the repeal in- \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 517]\n\u00a0\n volved nothing but the exercise of executive discretion and is therefore not subject to review of the courts.\n The reserved power to repeal a grant of special privileges implies that it may be exerted at the pleasure of the Legislature or other authority in which the power to repeal is vested. Tomlinson v. Jessup, 15 Wall. 454, 459; Miller v. State of New York, 15 Wall. 478, 498; Atlantic & G. Railroad Co. v. Georgia, \n98 U.S. 359\n, 365; Sinking-Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700\n, 720; Greenwood v. Union Freight Co., \n105 U.S. 13\n, 17; Calder v. Michigan, \n218 \nU.S. 591, 599\n, 31 S.Ct. 122; cf. Grand Trunk Western R. Co. v. South Bend, \n227 \nU.S. 544\n, 33 S.Ct. 303, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 405. That power is plainly distinguishable from the power to cancel for violation of the terms of the grant. In the absence of constitutional, legislative, or contractual restriction, the exertion of the first-mentioned power requires nothing more than an appropriate declaration of the repeal. Hamilton Gaslight Co. v. Hamilton City, \n146 \nU.S. 258, 270\n, 271 S., 13 S.Ct. 90. But, without consent of the holder, valid cancellation for condition broken cannot be accomplished without giving to the holder an opportunity to have the asserted default judicially determined. New York Electric Lines Co. v. Empire City Subway Co., supra, \n235 U.S. 179\n, page 195, 35  Ct. 72; Farnsworth v. Minnesota & Pac. R. Co., \n92 U.S. 49\n, 66; Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Co. v. Mingus, \n165 U.S. 413\n, 430-434, 17 S.Ct. 348; New York Indians v. United States, \n170 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 18 S.Ct. 531.\n We need not consider whether the expressly reserved power of repeal is trammeled by Act No. 70 or other law governing the commission or the appeals from its orders, for there is above disclosed enough of the proceedings and determinations of the commission and of the lower courts to show that the order in question was not the exertion of the expressly reserved power to repeal, but was the assertion of the implied right to cancel for failure of holders to perform their undertakings. On the appeal the District Court was not authorized to substitute for those \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 518]\n\u00a0\n of the commission its own views as to what action would be just or ought to be taken, or to perform any legislative, executive, or administrative function. Its only jurisdiction was to decide upon the record certified to it by the commission whether the order was: (1) Reasonable; (2) in conformity with the law; (3) based upon incompetent evidence. 'Reasonable,' as here employed, means not 'capricious,' 'arbitrary,' or 'confiscatory.' Whether the order of cancellation was reasonable in the sense that it did not transgress permissible limits is a question of law. It is not suggested that the other questions presented on the appeal were not within the jurisdiction of the court. The permissible scope of the determinations and judgment of the court is significant. It may only decide the questions of law raised by the appeal and affirm or reverse the order or remand the record to the commission for further action. It is without authority to amend or modify an order of the commission. The jurisdiction and duties of the Supreme Court and Circuit Court of Appeals are similar in all respects to those of the District Court. Neither has any power or function other than what is strictly judicial. It is clear that the Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction of the appeal taken to it. Pacific Tel. Co. v. Kuykendall, \n265 \nU.S. 196, 200\n, 44 S.Ct. 553; Federal Radio Comm. v. Nelson Bros. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266\n, 53 S.Ct. 627. Cf. Keller v. Potomac Elec. Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428, 444\n, 43 S.Ct. 445; Porter v. Investors' Syndicate, \n286 \nU.S. 461, 468\n, 52 S.Ct. 617; Federal Radio Comm. v. General Electric Co., \n281 \nU.S. 464, 469\n, 50 S. Ct. 389.\n\n 3. \nThe second question specified in the petition for the writ is whether the six individuals named as partners, constituting Russell & Co., are parties in interest entitled to appeal from the order. The question as put requires clarification by reference to the facts on which it is based. Havemeyer and the other persons named constitute a limited partnership, Russel & Co. Its answer to the order to show cause is in this form: \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 519]\n\u00a0\n 'Now comes Russell & Company, Sucrs., S. en C., a civil agricultural partnership organized in accordance with the laws of Puerto Rico, composed of Horace Havemeyer, Frank A. Dillingham, Frank M. Welty, Edwin L. Arnold and H.B. Orde, as partners. ...'\n The petition for appeal to the District Court begins: 'Now come Horace Havemeyer, Frank A. Dillingham, Edward S. Paine, Edwin L. Arnold, Frank M. Welty and Henry B. Orde, members of the civil agricultural partnership of Puerto Rico, Russell & Co., Sucrs., S. en C., and hereby appeal. ...'\n With immaterial variations in the use of words, the designation of appellants last given was followed in the petitions for appeals to the Supreme Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals. And so in substance were the appealing parties referred to in the opinions, judgments, and generally throughout the litigation. Petitioner's point comes to this: The partnership, Russell & Co., composed of the persons named as partners, claiming to be the owner of the irrigation privilege, answered the order to how cause; but the appeal from the order of cancellation was taken by these persons as partners constituting the partnership. The commission first raised the point in the Circuit Court of Appeals. If worthy of notice, it should have been made when the appeal was taken to the District Court. The appeal is in the nature of a suit to have the order adjudged invalid. The petition for appeal is the complaint. The commission answered on the merits. Thereby it admitted respondents' capacity to initiate the proceeding. Baltimore & P. Railroad Co. v. Fifth Baptist Church, \n137 \nU.S. 568, 572\n, 11 S.Ct. 185; Society for Propagation v. Town of Pawlet, 4 Pet. 480, 481, 501; Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Company, 1 Pet. 386, 450. Havemeyer and the other partners here maintain that, by the proceedings above described, the partnership itself, a jurisdical entity (Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co., \n288 \nU.S. 476, 482\n, 53 S.Ct. 447), \n\n[296 U.S. 506, 520]\n\u00a0\n in legal effect did take all the appeals and was before the Circuit Court of Appeals. It results that the commission's suggestion that the partnership will not be bound by the judgment is without merit. The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly held that the partnership appealed and was before it, and that the commission's objection came too late.\n\n 4. \nThe facts disclosed by the record support the conclusion of the commission and insular courts that the holder of the irrigation privilege is responsible for the overflow and resulting damages to private and public property. Reasonably construed, the franchise must be held to have given to the grantees control of the outlet and to have bound them to keep it sufficiently clear, for the passage of waters from the lake to the bay, to prevent raising them above the designated levels. The findings of fact included in the report of the commission and decisions of the insular courts, based as we must assume on adequate evidence, indicate that Russell & Co. allowed the outlet to become and remain filled up and that the obstruction caused the waters to overflow and keep submerged the large contiguous area that is above referred to. Having regard to the quasi public nature of the privilege, the extended period of the holder's default, the character of the resulting damages, and the commission's authority to terminate for breach of condition on which the grant was made, the order of cancellation is clearly not shown to be capricious, arbitrary, or otherwise contrary to law. Russell & Co. have failed to establish any ground upon which it may be set aside. Kern River Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 147, 155\n, 42 S.Ct. 60; Farnsworth v. Minnesota & Pac. R.

PARKS' ESTATE(1936)\nNo. 18\nArgued: October 15, 1936Decided: December 7, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 218]\n\u00a0\n George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., and Otis F. Glenn, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n\n\n[299 U.S. 217, 221]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Franz W. Castle, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case we are concerned with the bearing of state law upon the enforcement of an assessment against the estate of a stockholder of a national bank.\n Elvira J. Parks died March 20, 1928, owning twelve shares of the capital stock of the Austin National Bank of Chicago. May 17, 1928, the probate court of Cook county, Illinois, granted letters testamentary to the executors named in her will, who filed an inventory and supplemental inventory in the probate court within one year of the date of the letters. March 30, 1931, the Comptroller of the Currency declared the bank insolvent, closed it, and appointed the petitioner receiver, and May 21, 1931, assessed all stockholders, including the executors of Elvira J. Parks, 100 per cent. of the par value of their stock. The executors refused to honor the receiver's demand for payment, and on September 1, 1933, he filed his claim in the probate court for $1,327.17, the amount of the assessment with interest to the date of filing. January 13, 1934, the court disallowed the claim. The receiver appealed to the circuit court where the case was tried de novo. That court, applying a state statute, disallowed the claim as against undistributed assets in the hands of executors inventoried within one year from the date of the grant of letters because the claim did not accrue and was not presented to the probate court within that period, but allowed it as to assets not inventoried within the year. (From a stipulation filed in this court it appears that there are in the executors' possession inventoried assets in excess of the amount of petitioner's claim; that the estate is solvent; and that \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 222]\n\u00a0\n there are no assets not inventoried within one year from the granting of the letters, or discovered after the expiration of that period.) The Appellate Court of the First District of Illinois affirmed the judgment. A certificate of importance, requisite for a review by the Supreme Court of the state, was refused. Certiorari was granted to resolve a conflict respecting the construction of relevant federal statutes.\n U.S.C.Tit. 12,  64 (12 U.S.C.A.  64) is in part:\n'The stockholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, each to the amount of his stock therein, at the par value thereof in addition to the amount invested in such stock.'\n\n Section 66 (12 U.S.C.A.  66) is:\n'Persons holding stock as executors, administrators, guardians, or trustees, shall not be personally subject to any liabilities as stockholders; but the estates and funds in their hands shall be liable in like manner and to the same extent as the testator, intestate, ward, or person interested in such trust funds would be, if living and competent to act and hold the stock in his own name.'\n\n The petitioner asserts these sections give his claim a quality so superior to that of other contingent claims against a decedent's estate that it must be recognized by state tribunals without regard to limitations upon allowance imposed by state laws.\n The liability is imposed by the statute. \n1\n The original subscriber and likewise an immediate or remote vendee of the shares assumes a status-that of stockholder. The assumption of this status involves whatever conditions or burdens the federal statutes have imposed as incident to the holding of national bank shares. The contingent \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 223]\n\u00a0\n obligation to pay an assessment is rendered absolute by the Comptroller's action in ordering one; whether that action be taken during the stockholder's life or after his death. From the moment of the Comptroller's order for assessment the bank's receiver has a claim which would support an action of debt at common law against a living stockholder, or the executor of a deceased stockholder. And if assessment be made after the estate of a deceased stockholder has been distributed the receiver may proceed to recover the amount from distributees or heirs, if, and to the extent, they are liable for debts of the estate under the law of the domicile. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The first clause of section 66 obviously was intended to exempt from personal liability the executor, administrator, guardian or trustee who holds stock as such fiduciary whether standing of record in his name or in that of the decedent, ward, or settlor. The second declares that the estate and funds in the hands of an executor shall be liable as the testator would have been if living, competent, and a stockholder of record. The question is whether this clause adds anything to the obligation of the decedent which is cast upon his estate by operation of law irrespective of section 66.3 Does it impose upon the estate a liability differing from that which the law fastens upon the personal representative to discharge out of the estate, debts accruing before or after the decedent's death? We think that, as the first clause exonerates the fiduciary from personal liability, the second negatives the inference that the exoneration is to extend to the decedent's estate. This was the view taken by Judge Shipman in Davis v. Weed, 7 Fed.Cas. p. 186, No. 3,658, 44 Conn. 569:\n'I do not think that section 5152 (12 U.S.C.A.  66) was intended to affect the liability for assessments of estates in process \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 224]\n\u00a0\n of settlement. The principal object of the section was to prevent a personal liability from running against executors, administrators, trustees or guardians, who had purchased as trustees, or to whom had been transferred in their names, as trustees national bank stocks for the benefit of the trust estates. Having by such purchase voluntarily entered into a contingent liability for assessments, it might be claimed that a judgment de bonis propriis could be rendered against them. The main object of the section was to prevent personal judgments being rendered against such persons in whom the stock stood on the books of the bank, as trustees.'\n\n The statute evidences no intent to prefer the assessment over other claims against the estate, or to exempt the receiver from the pursuit of the remedy prescribed by the local law for collection of claims of the same sort.\n Section 64 gives the receiver no lien for the amount of the assessment against the property of a living stockholder. The claim may only be recovered by suit or action. The judgment obtained is collectible like any other; it has no preference in distribution if the debtor's property be in the hands of a receiver, if he has made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or become bankrupt. Section 66 makes a deceased stockholder's estate liable in like manner, and to the same extent, as he would have been if living. As no lien is created against the property of a living stockholder by section 64 section 66 imposes none against his estate. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The statute creates an unsecured and unpreferred claim against a decedent's estate. Where the assessment has \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 225]\n\u00a0\n been made in the decedent's lifetime an accrued and provable debt exists against his estate; if made after his death a claim against the funds and assets of the estate accrues as of the date of assessment.\n Although the petitioner's demand is based upon a federal statute, he may enforce it only in conformity to the law of the forum governing the recovery of debts of like nature. He might have sued in a federal court. Notwithstanding the statute providing that the citizenship of a national bank, for purposes of federal jurisdiction, shall be as if it were a corporation of the state where it has its place of business, the receiver is an officer of the United States and, as such, entitled to sue for assessments in a federal court, irrespective of the citizenship of the parties or the amount in controversy. \n5\n If he elect so to do, R.S.  721 ( 28 U.S.C.  725 (28 U.S.C.A.  725)) governs the trial:\n'The laws of the several States, except where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply'.\n\n In such a proceeding the state statute of limitations will be applied; 6 and it seems that the local substantive law governing property rights in stock will be observed. \n7\n Nor does the principle that the jurisdiction of courts of the United States cannot be defeated by a state's laws limiting redress of its own citizens to certain tribunals8 \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 226]\n\u00a0\n create such inconsistency or conflict as to require the overriding of the law of the state with respect to distribution of the estate of a decedent. Where, as here, a res has come into the possession and under the control of a state court, one having a right to go into the federal court, either by reason of diversity of citizenship, or because he is a federal officer, cannot obtain a judgment or decree entitling him to interfere with the administration of the res by the court having its possession. While he may not be denied his right to prosecute an action to judgment or a suit to final decree in the federal court, such judgment or decree can do no more than adjudicate the validity and amount of his claim. The marshaling of that claim with others, its priority, if any, in distribution, and all similar questions, are for the probate court upon presentation to it of the judgment or decree of the federal court. \n9\n Thus, though a receiver should resort to the United States District Court he would need to present, in a probate court, any judgment obtained, if he desired payment from the assets under the control of the latter.\n The receiver may, as petitioner elected to do, prosecute his claim in a state court. If he does, at least in the absence of congressional declaration to the contrary, the litigation will be governed by the common and statutory law of the state. Thus the local statute of limitations applies;10 and the local law as to the extinguishment of the estate and the liability vel non of distributees controls. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n If the state law requires a claim for an assessment to be prosecuted in an action of debt the receiver cannot elect to bring some other form of action or to sue in equity; \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 227]\n\u00a0\n conversely, if the law prescribes a suit in equity the receiver cannot bring an action at law. And if under the state statutes demands against a decedent's estate must be proved in a probate court the receiver cannot pursue some other form of action. This is not to say that a state may deny all remedy for the substantive right arising out of the federal statute ( see Seabury v. Green, supra); it is merely to say that if the state does not discriminate against the receiver's claim in favor of others of equal dignity and like character, there is no warrant for exempting the claim from the effect of local statutes governing procedure or limiting the time for prosecution of action.\n The petitioner, having elected to prove his claim in the appropriate state court, is bound by the laws of Illinois as to the enforcement of such claims, provided those laws are nondiscriminatory and operate equally upon all claims of the class in which his belongs.\n The relevant statute is section 70 of the Illinois Administration Act 12 which provides that five classes of claims against decedents' estates shall be preferred in the order named, e.g., funeral expenses, costs of administration, widow's share, etc. The sixth class is:\n'Sixth. All other debts and demands of whatever kind without regard to quality or dignity, which shall be exhibited to the court within one year from granting of letters as aforesaid.\n\n'All claims and demands of whatever class not exhibited to the court within one year13 from the granting of letters as aforesaid shall be forever barred as to property and estate of the deceased which has been inventoried or accounted for by the executor or administrator; and if the executor or administrator shall thereafter file any inventory listing other estate not previously inventoried or \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 228]\n\u00a0\n accounted for, and shall cause notice to be published in the manner provided by section 60 of this Act, or give such other notice as the court may direct, of a day fixed upon, which shall be not less than three months after the date of such first publication, for the filing and exhibiting of further claims against said decedent, all claims not exhibited to the court prior to the date so fixed shall be forever barred as to the property and estate listed in such inventory, and the amount remaining due on all claims exhibited to the court on or prior to the day so fixed upon as aforesaid, including those filed within one year from the granting of letters, shall be paid pro rata out of such subsequently inventoried estate, saving, however, to infants, persons of unsound mind and persons in the employment of the United States or of this State and residing outside of the United States, the term of one year after their respective disabilities are removed to exhibit their claims.'\n\n In Illinois a creditor whose claim against a decedent's estate is not due may present it for allowance and settlement provided the liability of the decedent was absolute. \n14\n Contingent claims may not be proved. \n15\n Section 70 is not a general statute of limitations but a specific provision intended to facilitate the early settlement of estates. \n16\n It results that a claim not presented within the year, though not entitled to be paid from assets inventoried within the year, is not barred, but may be collected out \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 229]\n\u00a0\n of assets subsequently discovered; and this is so whether the failure timely to present the claim was due to the creditor's negligence, or to the fact that the claim was contingent in character and did not become absolute by the happening of the contingency during the year. \n17\n If the claim is contingent, and the liability of the estate does not become absolute until after the expiration of the year, the creditor may recover from the distributees, to the extent of the assets received by them respectively. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n The claimant has only to present and prosecute his demand in the probate court, which has jurisdiction both of legal demands and those cognizable in equity. \n19\n While, therefore, the creditor need not resort to a court of law or equity to establish his claim, he may do so, since the jurisdiction of those courts over such claims has not been abolished. \n20\n He may present his claim to the probate court and, at the same time, proceed in equity in the circuit court for specific performance of the contract out of which the claim arises; 21 or present a mortgage note to \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 230]\n\u00a0\n the probate court and bring suit in equity to foreclose the deed of trust securing it so as to share in estate assets for any deficiency in his security. \n22\n But whatever the forum in which he prosecutes his demand, no execution is issued upon the judgment or decree obtained. Whether the claim is presented to the probate court or litigated in some other, within the year, the judgment is that the claim be paid 'in due course of administration'-that is, by an order of distribution out of the proceeds of inventories assets. \n23\n If judgment is recovered upon a demand, presented to the probate court or prosecuted at law or in equity after the expiration of the year, the judgment is special, that the claim be paid out of assets inventoried or discovered after the lapse of the year, like the common law judgment quando acciderint;24 or that it be enforced against distributees. \n25\n The only bar to the recovery of such a judgment is the general statute of limitations. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n A creditor cannot subject inventoried assets, undistributed and held by the administrator, to the payment of his claim by instituting, after the expiration of the year, and prosecuting to judgment, an action of debt against the administrator. \n27\n Nor can one who has failed to present his claim to the probate court, or to institute suit or action on it within the year, resort to a court of equity \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 231]\n\u00a0\n to have his demands paid out of undistributed inventoried assets. \n28\n\u00a0\n\n It is apparent that the decision under review enforces the policy of the state evidenced by section 70 of the Administration Act as it has been uniformly applied to claims of like character.\n The petitioner relies on Mortimer v. Potter, 213 Ill. 178, 72 N.E. 817, but it is not in point. The claim of the receiver for an assessment in that case accrued after the estate had been fully administered and while the stock with respect to which assessment was levied was in the hands of a trustee to whom it was devised by the testator. Under the principles of Illinois law, as has been shown, such a devisee who received assets from the decedent's estate is liable for the assessment to the extent of those assets.\n The petitioner also cites Zimmerman v. Carpenter (C.C.) 84 F. 747, as authority in his favor. In that case a circuit court of the Unied States entered a decree charging the assets in the hands of an executor with the amount of an assessment levied after the decedent's death. It is not clear from the opinion whether the court thought that section 66 creates a lien on estate assets from the date of the bank's failure or construed the section as creating a claim sui generis enforceable directly against assets in the possession of the executrix and under the control of a state court of competent jurisdiction. As we have shown above, either theory is wrong. \n\n[299 U.S. 217, 232]\n\u00a0\n In the absence of federal legislation giving priority to a claim for an assessment of stockholders' liability over other debts, or a lien upon the assets of a deceasd stockholder's estate, or a special remedy, the claim is not entitled to distribution otherwise than as specified in a nondiscriminatory statute of the domicile. The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] McClaine v.

It will be sufficient briefly to state the facts in No. 577. \n\n[297 U.S. 110, 112]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner, a processor of rice, filed its bill in District Court for Eastern Louisiana, to restrain the respondent from assessing or collecting taxes levied for the month of September, 1935, and subsequent months, pursuant to the Agricultural Adjustment Act 1933,2 as amended by the Act of August 24, 1935.3 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq. The bill charges the exaction is unconstitutional and alleges the respondent threatens collection by distraint, which will cause irreparable injury, as the petitioner has no adequate remedy at law to recover what may be collected. A preliminary injunction was sought. The respondent filed a motion to dismiss, citing Revised Statutes,  3224 (26 U.S.C.A.  1543) and section 21(a) of the amended Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C.A.  623(a) as prohibiting restraint of collection, and also asserting that the petitioner had a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. The court refused an interlocutory injunction and entered a decree dismissing the bill. Appeal was perfected to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The District Judge refused to grant an injunction pending the appeal. Application to the Circuit Court of Appeals for such an injunction was denied upon the view that the petitioner had an adequate remedy at law and the statute deprived the court of jurisdiction to restrain collection.\n In praying a writ of certiorari the petitioner asserted that by reason of the provisions of section 21(d), 7 U.S.C.A.  623(d), it would be impossible to recover taxes collected, even though the act were unconstitutional, since the section forbids recovery except upon a showing of facts not susceptible of proof. This court granted the writ and restrained collection of the tax upon condition that the petitioner should pay the amount of the accruing taxes to a depository, to the joint credit of petitioner and respondent; such funds to be withdrawn only upon the further order of the court. \n\n[297 U.S. 110, 113]\n\u00a0\n The cause was advanced for hearing and has been fully argued on the questions of the constitutionality of the exaction and the indequacy of the remedy for recovery of taxes paid.\n The changes made by the amendatory act of August 24, 1935, do not cure the infirmities of the original act which were the basis of decision in United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312 ( January 6, 1936). The exaction still lacks the quality of a true tax. It remains a means for effectuating the regulation of agricultural production, a matter not within the powers of Congress.\n We have no occasion to discuss or decide whether section 21(d) affords an adequate remedy at law. As yet the petitioner has not paid the taxes to the respondent, and, in view of the decision in the Butler Case, hereafter cannot be required so to do. If the respondent should now attempt to collect the tax by distraint, he would be a trespasser. The decree of the District Court will be vacated, an appropriate order entered directing the repayment to the petitioner of the funds impounded pendente lite, and the cause remanded to the District Court for the entry of a decree enjoining collection of the assailed exaction. A similar disposition will be made of the companion cases.\n Decree vacated. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The others are: No. 578, Dore v.

HELVERING(1936)\nNo. 24\nArgued: November 17, 1936Decided: December 7, 1936\n\n\n\n Mr. Eugene Untermyer, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Robert H. Jackson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners in these three causes were partners in Schafer Brothers, brokers at 120 Broadway, and member of the New York Stock Exchange. The firm traded for others; also bought and sold securities for itself. The \n\n[299 U.S. 171, 172]\n\u00a0\n latter were carried on its books in the so-called 'Error Account.'\n In order to ascertain the partners' taxable profits during 1929 the Commissioner held that securities in that account should be valued at their cost price; that as to them the partnership was not a dealer permitted to use inventories under Article 105, Treasury Regulations 74. Accordingly he found material deficiencies against each of the petitioners. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained his action; the court below affirmed.\n The petition, upon which we granted the writs, states this as the 'question presented': 'Was the partnership of which these petitioners were members a 'dealer in securities' as to securities bought and sold for its own account, and as such entitled to inventory such securities at cost or market, whichever was lower, in computing its income for 1929? ... Determination of the amount thus to be included in the income of each petitioner depends upon the basis upon which the partnership income is computed.'\n And as 'reasons for granting the writs' it averred: '(1) The decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia is in irreconcilable conflict on a matter of statutory interpretation with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Commissioner v. Stevens, 78 F.( 2d) 713, and with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Commissioner v. Charavay, 79 F.(2d) 406. (2) The precise question of statutory construction here presented is one of general public importance which has never been settled, and should be determined by this Court because of the number of pending cases involving the question, as well as the frequent occasions that the question is bound to arise in the future.'\n Our consideration is confined to the issue so tendered by the petition. \n\n[299 U.S. 171, 173]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner v. Stevens and Commissioner v. Charavay, supra, turned on the question whether Stevens and Legg, a 'Specialist' on the New York Stock Exchange, was a dealer whose profits should be determined upon inventories under Article 105, Treasury Regulations 74. The Board of Tax Appeals held it was, and the Circuit Court of Appeals in both the Second and Third Circuits approved that view. Considering the differing circumstances, we find no real conflict between the holdings in those cases and the ruling below. See Vaughan v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 85 F.(2d) 497.\n Pertinent provisions, Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, and Treasury Regulations 74, are in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[299 U.S. 171, 174]\n\u00a0\n Schafer Brothers was not a 'Specialist' in the stocks entered in its 'Error Account.' The Board of Tax Appeals found: 'The stocks in dispute were purchased for the firm's own account solely in expectation of a rise in the market, for sale to anyone at a profit, 'as distinguished from a purchase to create a stock of securities to take care of future buying orders in excess of selling orders.\" 'They were purchased solely in expectation of a rise in the market, for the partnership's own account for resale, to any buyer, at a profit. The meaning of 'dealer in securities,' as defined in the controlling regulation, has been considered many times by the courts, and this Board. It is limited to one who, as a merchant, buys and sells securities to customers for the profit thereon.'\n The evidence adequately supports these findings.\n Seeley v. Helvering, Commissioner (C.C.A.) 77 F.(2d) 323, Hammitt v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 79 F.(2d) 494, and Vaughan v. Commissioner, supra, are in harmony with our conclusion.\n We find no adequate reason for disturbing the challenged judgment, and it is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791,  22 (26 U.S.C.A.  22 and note):\n's 22.

Whenever in the opinion of the Commissioner the use of inventories is necessary in order clearly to determine the income of any taxpayer, inventories shall be taken by such taxpayer upon such basis as the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, may prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting the income.'\n\n Treasury Regulation 74:\n'Art. 101. Need of Inventories.-In order to reflect the net income correctly, inventories at the beginning and end of each year are necessary in every case in which the production, purchase, or sale of merchandise is an income-producing factor. ...\n\n'Art. 105. Inventories by dealers in securities.-A dealer in securities, who in his books of account regularly inventories unsold securities on hand either-\n\n (a) At cost;\n (b) At cost or market, whichever is lower; or\n (c) At market value, may make his return upon the basis upon which his accounts are kept; provided that a description of the method employed shall be included in or attached to the return, that all the securities must be inventoried by the same method, and that such method must be adhered to in subsequent years, unless another be authorized by the Commissioner. For the purpose of this rule a dealer in securities is a merchant of securities, whether an individual, partnership, or corporation, with an established place of business, regularly engaged in the purchase of securities and their resale to customers; that is, one who as a merchant buys securities and sells them to customers with a view to the gains and profits that may be derived therefrom. If such business is simply a branch of the activities carried on by such person, the securities inventoried as here provided may include only those held for purposes of resale and not for investment. Taxpayers who buy and sell or hold securities for investment or speculation and not in the course of an established business, and officers of corporations and members of partnerships who in their individual capacities buy and sell securities, are not dealers in securities within the meaning of this rule.' \n\n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHENEBECK v.

The jury rendered a verdict for $1,500 and the judgment thereon was affirmed by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 186 S.E. 283. The court overruled petitioner's contention based on the federal act known as the Carmack Amendment. 49 U.S. C.  20(11), 49 U.S.C.A.  20(11). It appeared that the shipment was interstate, from Jacksonville, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina. The applicable tariff filed by the carrier provided:\n'In consideration of the rate charged for carrying said property, which is dependent upon the value thereof and is based upon an agreed valuation of not exceeding fifty dollars for any shipment of 100 pounds or less, and not exceeding fifty cents per pound, actual weight, for any shipment in excess of 100 pounds, unless a greater value is declared at the time of shipment, the shipper agrees \n\n[299 U.S. 28, 29]\n\u00a0\n that the company shall not be liable in any event for more than fifty dollars for any shipment of 100 pounds or less, or for more than fifty cents per pound, actual weight, for any shipment weighing more than 100 pounds unless a greater value is stated herein. Unless a greater value is declared and stated herein the shipper agrees that the value of the shipment is as last above set out and that the liability of the company shall in no event exceed such value.'\n\n There was evidence that the value declared was $50 and that the rate was fixed accordingly. The trial court ruled that as the suit was for damages for the interruption of plaintiff's business caused by the delay alleged to be due to negligence, the limitation of liability did not apply. The Supreme Court of the State sustained that view.\n We hold that this was error. The federal statute controls. Adams Express Co. v.

The words of the statute 'are comprehensive enough to embrace all damages resulting from any failure to discharge a carrier's duty with respect to any part of the transportation to the agreed destination.' The statute thus applies to damages caused by delay in making delivery. New York, Philadelphia & Norfolk R. Co. v.

The underlying principle is that the carrier is entitled to base rates upon value and that its compensation should bear a reasonable relation to the risk and responsibility assumed. Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, supra. The broad purpose of the federal act is to compel the establishment of reasonable rates and to provide for their uniform application.

Maddox, of Rome, Ga., and H. O'B. Cooper, Sidney S. Alderman, and S. R. Prince, all of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Reuben R. Arnold and B. P. Gambrell, both of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n Respondent's intestate, J. M. Cox, driver of the engine on petitioner's fast train from Birmingham to Atlanta, lost his life when it overturned. As the train moved forty miles per hour over a six-degree curve to the left, something, apparently a stone, turned the wheels of the front truck to the right and off the rails. After bumping over the crossties for seven-tenths of a mile, they struck a switch and the upset followed.\n The front or boiler end of the locomotive found support through a rigidly attached center casting rounded to fit, some three or four inches, into another casting made fast to the forward truck. This adjustment permitted passage around curves. The parts were held together by the weight of the locomotive. If the wheels of the truck left the rails, the connection would be broken; the locomotive would rest on the driving wheels and short chains attached to it would pull the truck along. Compressed air, carried in a hose pipe from the pump, controlled all brakes. Pressure released them; when withdrawn, they automatically applied.\n A mechanism, known as 'Wright's Little Watchman,' fastened beneath the locomotive frame, carried a valve closing an entrance into the air line actuated by a lever or trigger. A pull on this would open the valve, let out \n\n[297 U.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n air, and thus set the brakes. The lever was connected with the forward truck; if its wheels left the track and fell five inches or more, a downward pull was expected.\n Newly constructed locmotives carry no Watchman; they are not in common use. Petitioner buys and applies them; has experimented with them for seven years; nearly all of its passenger locomotives carry them. The device is not regarded as an essential or integral part. The carrier's general superintendent testified without contradiction: 'The use of this device cannot possibly endanger the operation of the train. It is used in the hope that it may apply the brakes and stop the train in event of derailment of front trucks. My experience with this device is that it sometimes works and sometimes will not work, and that it cannot be relied upon with any degree of certainty.' Both witnesses who spoke to the point asserted that it was in an experimental stage; was being tried out with the hope of securing good results; sometimes it had proved effective, sometimes it disappointed. Notwithstanding use during seven years, it remained experimental.\n Respondent brought an action for damages in a state court and relied upon wo grounds: (1) Failure properly to maintain the track; (2) failure to keep the Watchman in proper condition wherefore it failed to function and arrest the train. The court presented the cause to the jury upon both theories. Judgment for respondent after a favorable verdict was affirmed by the appellate court. Discussion of the first ground is unnecessary; the judgment must be reversed because of error in the charge relative to the second.\n The Boiler Inspection Act of June 7, 1924, c. 355,  2, 43 Stat. 659, U.S.C.A., title 45,  23, provides: 'It shall be unlawful for any carrier to use or permit to be used on its line any locomotive unless paid loco- \n\n[297 U.S. 398, 401]\n\u00a0\n motive, its boiler, tender, and all parts and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition and safe to operate in the service to which the same are put, that the same may be employed in the active service of such carrier without unnecessary peril to life or limb, and unless said locomotive, its boiler, tender, and all parts and appurtenances thereof have been inspected from time to time in accordance with the provisions of sections 28, 29, 30, and 32 and are able to withstand such test or tests as may be prescribed in the rules and regulations hereinafter provided for.'\n This enactment has been much considered. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Groeger, \n266 \nU.S. 521\n, 45 S.Ct. 169; Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 605\n, 47 S.Ct. 207; United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 454\n, 55 S.Ct. 268. But we have not heretofore undertaken to give definite interpretation to the words 'parts and appurtenances.'\n The accepted doctrine is that the act imposes upon the carrier an absolute and continuing duty to maintain the locomotive, and all parts and appurtenances thereof, in proper condition, and safe to operate in active service without unnecessary peril to life or limb. Also that, after proper inquiry, the Interstate Commerce Commission may 'prescribe the rules and regulations by which the fitness for service shall be determined.'\n The Commission has promulgated no rule mentioning Little Watchmen; they are not subjected to inspection; without them locomotives 'may be employed in the active service ... without unnecessary peril to life or limb.' While most carriers do not use them, their locomotives commonly are in 'proper condition.'\n Respondent does not suggest that the Watchman, whether operative or not, detracted from safety or in any way contributed to the derailment. But it is said that in the circumstances shown the mechanism failed promptly to stop the train, and the jury was at liberty to find \n\n[297 U.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n faulty condition which caused the engineer's death. The soundness of this reasoning we need not consider; certiorari was granted because of another point.\n Upon the evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, the Watchman was in the experimental stage. Use during seven years gave it no other status, as the witnesses pointed out. Neverthless, the claim is that when attached it became a part or appurtenance which the carrier was absolutely bound properly to maintain.\n With frankness, counsel assert: 'There is no doubt that the judge charged that as to this device there was an absolute requirement that it should be in proper condition.' In support of this, they urge: The carrier 'creates its own standard of safety by the appliances which it places on its own locomotive; and that the Boiler Inspection Act, in requiring all parts and appurtenances on the entire locomotive to be in proper condition, applies to each particular locomotive of every type.'\n We are unable to accept this view. With reason, it cannot be said that Congress intended that every gadget placed upon a locomotive by a carrier, for experimental purposes, should become part thereof within the rule of absolute liability. So to hold would hinder commendable efforts to better conditions and tend to defeat the evident purpose-avoidance of unnecessary peril to life or limb. Whatever in fa t is an integral or essential part of a completed locomotive, and all parts or attachments definitely prescribed by lawful order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, are within the statute. But mere experimenal devices which do not increase the peril, but may prove helpful in an emergency, are not. These have not been excluded from the usual rules relative to liability.\n The charge in the particulars indicated was erroneous and prejudicial.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST.

They include detailed findings with respect to the services rendered by appellant and its rates, the used and useful character of appellant's property, the valuation of used and useful land, the value of appellant's structures on the basis of cost of reproduction new less depreciation, working capital, going concern value, fair value on the basis of the facts found, fair rate of return, reasonable operating expenses (including repairs, depreciation and taxes), necessary revenue, and volume of business. The Secretary found that the existing rates produced revenues in excess of those necessary to pay reasonable expenses and afford a fair return; that 'the schedule of rates and charges now in effect is unreasonable and unjustly discriminatory.'\n As a guide to his determination of reasonable rates, the Secretary caused an analysis to be made of the books and records of the appellant covering the six-year period from 1927 to 1932. He reached his conclusion in the light of that evidence. Appellant contends that, as a prerequisite to a reduction of rates, it was necessary for the Secretary to find that the rates were unreasonable 'at the time of the hearing,' and that there were no findings to support such a conclusion with respect to the year 1932, the year immediately preceding the hearing. But, in determining whether the existing rates were unreasonable, the Secretary was not confined to evidence as to \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 47]\n\u00a0\n their operation at the precise time of his hearing, or in the months, or even a year, immediately prior thereto. He was entitled to consider the conditions which then obtained and also to extend his examination over such a reasonable period of past operations as would enable him to make a fair prediction in fixing the maximum rates to be charged in the future. The Secretary had before him the particular conditions which prevailed in the year 1932 and in the selection of the six-year period including that year, and in not taking the year 1932 as a sole criterion we find nothing arbitrary. There are also objections to the failure of the Secretary to make specific findings on certain points of fact, but, so far as the requirement of findings is concerned, we think that the extensive findings that were made adequately supported his order.\n Second. The Refusal of the Secretary to Reopen the Proceeding.-The hearing was closed on February 16, 1933. In the following January a copy of the proposed order was transmitted to counsel for appellant and opportunity was given to file exceptions. Numerous exceptions were filed, and at the same time (February, 1934) appellant asked for a further hearing upon the ground that there had been such a serious change in conditions affecting the value of the company's property, its income, and the probable receipts of livestock and expenses of its yards, that the record no longer fairly reflected these matters. The application pointed to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12, 1933 (48  at. 31), the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 195), and the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 337)-all as producing changes of which account should be taken. Appellant also alleged that its books and records were available to give the complete results of its operations for the year 1933, which showed a lower net operating income than that stated in the Secre- \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 48]\n\u00a0\n tary's proposed report. The Secretary heard argument, made an informal investigation, and denied the application. He was careful to say that, while as a result of his investigation he found no adequate ground for reopening the proceeding, he did not use the facts thus elicited as a part of the record upon which his determination of rates was based. After stating what he deemed to be comparative results of operations in 1933 and in January and February, 1934, the Secretary gave as the general grounds for his action that it was inevitable that in such determinations considerable time must be consumed and that there would be some economic change; that appellant had obtained one rehearing because the first hearing had been followed by a general business depression which adversely affected its gross revenues; that it sought another because since the last hearing there had been a general improvement in those conditions; that in determining the values used as a rate base 'depression or stagnation values' had carefully been avoided and 'normals' used; that the prescribed rates which the Secretary deemed to be fair at that time would, 'as the economic improvement continues, become liberal'; that the matter had been 'in hearing and litigation since the year 1929' and the time had come for decision.\n The decree of the District Court was filed on May 1, 1935. Despite the opportunity which the suit afforded, the record shows no endeavor on the part of appellant to prove any additional facts as to the conditions which obtained in 1933, or as to its operations in that year or at any time down to the hearing in the District Court, or as to any matter outside the record which had been made before the Secretary. The court concluded that the effect of the legislation of 1933 was speculative; that the difference between the amount which appellant claimed would have been earned under the prescribed rates, if applied to the business of 1933, and the amount found by \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 49]\n\u00a0\n the Secretary to constitute the reasonable net return, was 'too small to be taken as a guide for a rate'; that, in order 'to gauge the future,' the Secretary had taken six years, 'two of which were deeply affected by the depression,' and that the experience before the Secretary 'was up to ten days before the date of the hearing.' In that view the court decided that the proceeding should not be reopened and that the question of the effects urged by appellants in that relation should await the test of actual experience upon which, if sufficient reasons were shown, the Secretary's order could be challenged. 11 F.Supp. 322, at page 325. We find no error in that conclusion. If it be found that the rates as prescribed were not confiscatory, we see no reason for holding the Secretary's order to be ineffective because of his refusal to reopen the proceeding. United States v. Northern Pacific Railway Company, \n288 \nU.S. 490\n, 53 S.Ct. 406.\n Third. The Scope of Judicial Review upon the Issue of Confiscation.- The question is not one of fixing a reasonable charge for a mere personal service subject to regulation under the commerce power, as in the case of market agencies employing but little capital. See Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra, \n280 U.S. 420\n, at pages 438, 439, 50 S.Ct. 220. Here a large capital investment is involved and the main issue is as to the alleged confiscation of that investment.\n A preliminary question is presented by the contention that the District Court, in the presence of this issue, failed to exercise its independent judgment upon the facts. 11 F.Supp. 322, at pages 326-328. See Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287, 289\n, 40 S.Ct. 527; Prendergast v. New York Telephone Co., \n262 \nU.S. 43, 50\n, 43 S. Ct. 466; Bluefield Water Works & Imp. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679, 689\n, 43 S.Ct. 675; United Railways & Electric Co. v. West, \n280 \nU.S. 234, 251\n, 50 S.Ct. 123; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra, \n280 U.S. 420\n, at pages 443, 444, 50 S.Ct. 220; Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 600\n, 51 S.Ct. 608; Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 60\n, 52 S.Ct. 285; State Corporation Commission v. Wichita Gas \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 50]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n290 \nU.S. 561, 569\n, 54 S.Ct. 321. The District Court thought that the question was still an open one under the Packers and Stockyards Act, and expressed the view that, even though the issue is one of confiscation, the court is bound to accept the findings of the Secretary if they are supported by substantial evidence and that it is not within the judicial province to weigh the evidence and pass upon the issues of fact. The government points out that, notwithstanding what was said by the court upon this point, the court carefully analyzed the evidence, made many specific findings of its own, and in addition adopted, with certain exceptions, the findings of the Secretary. The government insists that appellant thus had an adequate judicial review, and, further, that the case is in equity and comes before the court on appeal, and that from every point of view the clear preponderance of the evidence shows that the prescribed rates were in fact just and reasonable. Hence the government says that the decree should be affirmed, irrespective of possible error in the reasoning of the District Court. See West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., \n295 \nU.S. 662, 680\n, 55 S.Ct. 894\n\n\n In view, however, of the discussion in the court's opinion,1 the preliminary question should be considered. The fixing of rates is a legislative act. In determining the scope of judicial review of that act, there is a distinction between action within the sphere of legislative authority and action which transcends the limits of legislative power. Exercising its rate-making authority, the Legislature has a broad discretion. It may exercise that authority directly, or through the agency it creates or appoints to act for that purpose in accordance with appropriate standards. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 51]\n\u00a0\n The court does not sit as a board of revision to substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature or its agents as to matters within the province of either. San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 23 S.Ct. 571; Minnesota Rate Cases (Simpson v. Shepard), \n230 \nU.S. 352, 433\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann.Cas. 1916A, 18; Los Angeles Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 304\n, 53 S.Ct. 637. When the Legislature itself acts within the broad field of legislative discretion, its determinations are conclusive. When the Legislature appoints an agent to act within that sphere of legislative authority, it may endow the agent with power to make findings of fact which are conclusive, provided the requirements of due process which are specially applicable to such an agency are met, as in according a fair hearing and acting upon evidence and not arbitrarily. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185; Virginian Railway Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 663\n, 47 S.Ct. 222; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra, \n280 U.S. 420\n, at page 444, 50 S.Ct. 220; Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 54 S.Ct. 603. In such cases the judicial inquiry into the facts goes no further than to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the findings, and the question of the weight of the evidence in determining issues of fact lies with the l gislative agency acting within its statutory authority.\n But the Constitution fixes limits to the rate-making power by prohibiting the deprivation of property without due process of law or the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. When the Legislature acts directly, its action is subject to judicial scrutiny and determination in order to prevent the transgression of these limits of power. The Legislature cannot preclude that scrutiny or determination by any declaration or legislative finding. Legislative declaration or finding is necessarily subject to independent judicial review upon the facts and the law by courts of competent juris- \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 52]\n\u00a0\n diction to the end that the Constitution as the supreme law of the land may be maintained. Nor can the Legislature escape the constitutional limitation by authorizing its agent to make findings that the agent has kept within that limitation. Legislative agencies, with varying qualifications, work in a field peculiarly exposed to political demands. Some may be expert and impartial, others subservient. It is not difficult for them to observe the requirements of law in giving a hearing and receiving evidence. But to say that their findings of fact may be made conclusive where constitutional rights of liberty and property are involved, although the evidence clearly establishes that the findings are wrong and constitutional rights have been invaded, is to place those rights at the mercy of administrative officials and seriously to impair the security inherent in our judicial safeguards. That prospect, with our multiplication of administrative agencies, is not one to be lightly regarded. It is said that we can retain judicial authority to examine the weight of evidence when the question concerns the right of personal liberty. But, if this be so, it is not because we are privileged to perform our judicial duty in that case and for reasons of convenience to disregard it in others. The principle applies when rights either of person or of property are protected by constitutional restrictions. Under our system there is no warrant for the view that the judicial power of a competent court can be circumscribed by any legislative arrangement designed to give effect to administrative action going beyond the lmits of constitutional authority. This is the purport of the decisions above cited with respect to the exercise of an independent judicial judgment upon the facts where confiscation is alleged. The question under the Packers and Stockyards Act is not different from that arising under any other act, and we see no reason why those decisions should be overruled. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 53]\n\u00a0\n But this judicial duty to exercise an independent judgment does not require or justify disregard of the weight which may properly attach to findings upon hearing and evidence. On the contrary, the judicial duty is performed in the light of the proceedings already had and may be greatly facilitated by the assembling and analysis of the facts in the course of the legislative determination. Judicial judgment may be none the less appropriately independent because informed and aided by the sifting procedure of an expert legislative agency. Moreover, as the question is whether the legislative action has passed beyond the lowest limit of the permitted zone of reasonableness into the forbidden reaches of confiscation, judicial scrutiny must of necessity take into account the entire legislative process, including the reasoning and findings upon which the legislative action rests. We have said that 'in a question of rate-making there is a strong presumption in favor of the conclusions reached by an experienced administrative body after a full hearing.' Darnell v. Edwards, \n244 \nU.S. 564, 569\n, 37 S.Ct. 701, 703. The established principle which guides the court in the exercise of its judgment on the entire case is that the complaining party carries the burden of making a convincing showing and that the court will not interfere with the exercise of the rate-making power unless confiscation is clearly established. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 305\n, 53 S.Ct. 637; Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n292 \nU.S. 151, 169\n, 54 S.Ct. 658; Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 298\n, 54 S.Ct. 647.\n A cognate question was considered in Manufacturers' Railway Company v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 470\n, 488 S.-490, 38 S.Ct. 383, 392. There, appellees insisted that the finding of the Interstate Commerce Commission upon the subject of confiscation was conclusive, or at least that it was not subject to be attacked upon evidence not presented to the Commission. We did not sustain that contention. Nevertheless, we \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 54]\n\u00a0\n pointed out that correct practice required that 'in ordinary cases, and where the opportunity is open,' all the pertinent evidence should be submitted in the first instance to the Commission. The Court did not approve the course that was pursued in that case 'of withholding from the Commission essential portions of the evidence that is alleged to show the rate in question to be confiscatory.' And it was regarded as beyond debate that, where the Commission after full hearing had set aside a given rate as unreasonably high, it would require a 'clear case' to justify a court, 'upon evidence newly adduced but not in a proper sense newly discovered,' in annulling the action of the Commission upon the ground that the same rate was so unreasonably low as to deprive the carrier of its constitutional right of compensation. With that statement the Court turned to an examination of the evidence. The principle thus recognized with respect to the weight to be accorded to action by the Commission after full hearing applies a fortiori when the case is heard upon the record made before the Commission or, as in this case, upon the record made before the Secretary of Agriculture. It follows, in the application of this principle, that, as the ultimate determination whether or not rates are confiscatory ordinarily rests upon a variety of subordinate or primary findings of fact as to particular elements, such findings made by a legislative agency after hearing will not be disturbed save as in particular instances they are plainly shown to be overborne.\n As the District Court, despite its observations as to the scope of review, apparently did pass upon the evidence, making findings of its own and adopting findings of the Secretary, we do not think it necessary to remand the cause for further consideration, and we turn to the other questions presented by the appeal.\n Fourth. Valuation of Property, Income, Expenses, and Fair Return.-The Secretary found that the fair value of ap- \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 55]\n\u00a0\n pellant's property, used and useful in its stockyards service, to be $2, 743,000. The District Court made certain additions of land which the Secretary had excluded from his appraisal, arriving at a rate base of $2, 752,964. The Secretary found 7 per cent. to be a reasonable rate of return, which would mean net earnings of $192,010 on his rate base, or $192,710 on that of the court below. The Secretary estimated that under the prescribed rates appellant's net income available for return upon its investment would be $195,564, or 7.13 per cent. on his valuation.\n Elaborate briefs have discussed a host of details in attacking and defending these estimates. While we have examined the evidence and appellant's contentions on each point, it is impracticable to attempt in this opinion to state more than our general conclusions.\n\n 1. \nProperty Values.-For the purpose of demonstrating that its rates were not unreasonable prior to 1932, appellant state that it adopts the findings of the Secretary in his first decision as to the total value of its property. That value was then fixed at $3,382,148, to which appellant adds the value of certain additional land now found to be used and useful, $ 329,163, giving a total value, which appellant says is applicable to the years 1927-1931, of $3,711,311. But the first hearing was begun and concluded in December, 1929, and, while the order was not promulgated until July 20, 1931, it was predicated, as the District Court said in reviewing that order, upon the value of the property as of the year 1928 and the volume of business during that year. St. Joseph Stockyards Co. v. United States, 58 F.(2d) 290, at page 291. Appellant insisted in its bill of complaint in the first suit that the Secretary's denial of its request for reopening was arbitrary, as economic conditions had materially changed since 1928. The District Court, applying the principle of our decision in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States, 284 U.S. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 56]\n\u00a0\n 248, 52 S.Ct. 146, held that a rehearing should have been granted. 58 F.(2d) 290, at pages 296, 297. The Secretary then vacated his prior order and reopened the proceeding. There is no question of res judicata. Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra, \n280 U.S. 420\n, at page 445, 50 S.Ct. 220. Compare Clark's Ferry Bridge Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n291 \nU.S. 227, 233\n, 54 S.Ct. 427. Appellant could not obtain an examination of the changed conditions with respect to its income and outlays in the period after 1928 and at the same time insist that the change in values due to the depression should be ignored.\n Appellant provides the physical facilities for a market and renders various services in connection with livestock. It supplies office buildings, docks for loading and unloading, 'chute pens,' 'sales pens' and alleys, and the various appurtenances for the proper care of livestock that are essential to its service in warehousing. The property thus consists of land and various structures.\n Value of Land.-The Secretary found that of the land owned by appellant there were 4,410,361 square feet used and useful in its stockyards services. The District Court added 122,041 square feet. 11 F. Supp. 322, 336. Appellant complains, on this appeal, of the exclusion of the property known as the 'Transit House' and of the value assigned to the property which was included in the rate base.\n The 'Transit House' is a commercial hotel (occupying 15,805 square feet of land) with a limited patronage supplied by shippers and drivers of trucks. Appellant claims that the land and building are worth $120,143. Appellant points to the ruling of the Secretary in the first proceeding that the hotel should be considered a part of the used and useful propererty in the stockyards service. In his second decision, now under review, the Secretary found that the hotel was constructed many years ago when transportation facilities between the stockyard area and the 'main- uptown' area were limited; that at the time of the first hearing the hotel was leased for a rental \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 57]\n\u00a0\n of $1,200 a year, and that the business had not warranted an increase, as provided in the lease, up to the time of the second hearing; that the decadence of the property had resulted principally from the development of good roads and the use of motor vehicles and the street car system of the city of St. Joseph, as well as from the change in the method of marketing livestock. It did not appear that the hotel produced enough revenue to pay taxes, insurance, and upkeep, to saying nothing of a return on its alleged value, and it is plain that, if its value were to be included in the rate base, the effect would be to levy an annual charge upon the patrons of the yards, principally the original shippers, in order to maintain hotel facilities on a noncompensatory basis for the special benefit of the truck drivers and others who patronized it.\n The District Co rt held that it would have to be shown very clearly that the business of the yards would be materially affected by the absence of a near-by hotel before it could be said that its maintenance was so related to the stockyards business as to be properly included in fixing the rate for yard services. The court said that there was no such showing. We take the same view.\n The land found to be used and useful is divided into several zones. Appellant assigns error in valuation only in the case of Zone A, in which, however 70 per cent. of the used and useful land, or 3,003,973 square feet, is included. The Secretary valued this land at 16 cents per square foot, or at $480,635. Appellant contends that it is worth at least $275,164 more, which would be at the rate of about 25 cents a square foot.\n Expert witnesses for both parties testified at length. At the first hearing, in 1929, two witnesses for appellant valued the land in Zone A at 30 cents per square foot. The witness for the government valued it at 35 cents, predicated upon its particular value for stockyard use; otherwise at 20 cents. Before the second hearing, in 1933, \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 58]\n\u00a0\n two of these witnesses had died. The surviving witness for appellant again testified, giving a value, as of August, 1932, of 26 cents per square foot, and a second witness for appellant thought it worth 35 cents. The new witness for the government placed the value as of November, 1932, at $5, 000 an acre, or about 11 1\/2 cents per square foot.\n All the witnesses were highly qualified experts. Their valuations were of the naked land, without improvements. The three witnesses at the second hearing had collaborated in examining about 147 different transactions relating to property in the general vicinity, but they reached independent conclusions. The government's witness attached special weight to five sales, or groups of sales, made at different times from 1918 to 1930 at prices as low or lower than the valuation he fixed. Appellant points to other transfers at other locations at higher prices. Manifestly these transactions involved collateral inquiries, and in the end simply afforded information of varying significance to aid the forming of an expert judgment. Appellant recognizes the impracticability of attempting to analyze 'the rather involved transfers and locations in an attempt to determine the truth as between the land appraisers.' Accordingly, appellant seeks to demonstrate that the Secretary's finding is vitiated by what is asserted to be his reliance upon an erroneous analysis of a sale by appellant, in 1929, of the entire capital stock of a terminal belt railway company which served the stockyards and the adjacent industrial area. It is said that none of the expert witnesses based their appraisals upon that transaction. We think that appellant overestimates the relative weight given to it by the Secretary and fails to take proper account of the effect of its use. The Secretary found that the valuation by the government's witness at 11 1\/2 cents per square foot was 'well supported by analysis of transactions in adjacent \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 59]\n\u00a0\n and similar lands,' but the Secretary thought that the witness had failed to give consideration to the belt railway sale. That led the Secretary to give a higher valuation than that of the government's witness. And on all the evidence the Secretary fixed the value at 16 cents per square foot which he said did not represent 'depression or stagnation value' but constituted 'the reasonable normal value of the land giving weight to values existing immediately preceding as well as those existing during the present depression.'\n The weight to be accorded to the testimony of the experts cannot be determined without understanding their approach to the question and the criteria which governed their estimates. The testimony of appellant's witnesses shows quite clearly that they proceeded, in part at least, upon an erroneous basis. The Packers and Stockyards Act treats the various stockyards of the country 'as great ational public utilities to promote the flow of commerce from the ranges and farms of the West to the consumers in the East.' It assumes that 'they conduct a business affected by a public use of a national character and subject to national regulation.' Stafford v. Wallace, supra, \n258 U.S. 495\n, at page 516, 42 S.Ct. 397, 402, 23 A.L.R. 229. Appellant, conducting such a business, was entitled to be allowed in the fixing of its rates the fair market value of its land for all available uses and purposes, which would include any element of value that it might have by reason of special adaptation to particular uses. But it was not entitled to an increase over that fair market value by virtue of the public use. Minnesota Rate Cases (Simpson v. Shepard), \n230 \nU.S. 352, 451\n, 455 S., 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N. S.) 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18; Clark's Ferry Bridge Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, \n291 U.S. 227\n, at page 238, 54 S.Ct. 427. We think that appellant's witnesses failed to give proper heed to this principle. Their testimony indicates that they did not consider simply the availability of the land for all uses and purposes, including its availability for a stockyard, but attached special weight to the actual and profitable public \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 60]\n\u00a0\n use. They apparently included in their estimates an increment of value, by virtue of that use, which is inadmissible in a proceeding to determine the reasonable rates to be charged for the public service.\n The point is illustrated by the difference in their estimate of the value of the land in Zone B. That is a tract of about seventeen acres adjoining Zone A. One of appellant's witnesses described the land in Zone B as 'of the same character' as that occupied by appellant's hog sheds and that it had equal railroad service. It was said to join that portion of appellant's land which 'is actively used in the conduct of its business.' The other witness for appellant said that 'with respect to topography, rail service and accessibility this ground is much the same as Zone A, which lies immediately to the north.' But the first witness placed a value of 13 cents per square foot on the land in Zone B as compared with 26 cents per square foot on that of Zone A, and the second witness valued the former at 15 cents per square foot and the latter at 35 cents. The first witness said that Zone B was not valued as high as Zone A because 'it is not actually in use' by appellant 'for the immediate conduct of its business but is in waiting'; that it 'had not been brought into its highest and best use,' but, when it had been brought into that use, it would 'be worth just as much as the land in tract A.' When we consider that the question was of the fair market value of the bare land in the light of its availability, but without improvements (which were separately valued), the erroneous theory on which appellant's witnesses valued Zone A is apparent. The Secretary fixed the value of the land in Zone A and the similarily available land in Zone B at the same amount.\n Our conclusion is that the evidence falls short of that convincing character which would justify us in disturbing the Secretary's finding. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 61]\n\u00a0\n Value of Structures.-There appears to be no dispute as to the method of valuation, which was on the basis of cost of reproduction new, less depreciation. The property was inventoried and appraised independently by two qualified engineers, one employed by appellant and the other by the government. Their estimates of the cost of reproduction new were not very far apart. On that evidence the Secretary found that cost, excluding nonuseful property, to be $2,637,186. This included construction overheads, general salaries and expenses, legal expenses, compensation of architects and engineers, fire and tornado insurance, workmen's compensation and public liability insurance, and taxes during construction, making a total of $2,494,043 on the 1927 inventory, which was increased by $143,143 for the additions and betterments to 1932.\n Appellant presents no contention as to this valuation, but contests the amount deducted by the Secretary for existing depreciation. He took 76. 04 per cent. of the cost of reproduction new as representing the depreciated value of the structures, and thus his deduction amounted to $ 597,570. That was close to the estimate of the government's engineer. Appellant's engineer testified that the present condition was 89 per cent.\n Appellant's contention is that there was no evidence to support the Secretary's deduction for existing depreciation and that the only legal evidence on this point was that of appellant's witness. The precise criticism is that the percentage used by the government's engineer in his testimony was based on an average of percentages given by five of his assistants, none of whom testified. It appears, however, that the government's witness had personally inspected the property in preparation for the first hearing at which he testified as to the result of the inspection and the methods he adopted. At the second hearing he testified that he followed the principles of his first \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 62]\n\u00a0\n appraisal in that of 1932, except that he had his five assistant engineers make separate estimates of which he took the average. In answer to appellant's contention as to their failure to testify, the government produces a stipulation as to the record which shows that, when the exhibits covering the appraisal by the government's witness and the estimates of the assistants were offered in evidence, the government's counsel stated that, if there was any objection upon the ground that they had not testified, the government would produce any or all of them for cross-examination respecting the exhibits. Later, after an opportunity for an examination of the exhibits by appellant's counsel, they were received in evidence, appellant's counsel stating that no objection was made other than the general one theretofore made, and applicable throughout the proceeding, that the Secretary had no power to find the value of appellant's property. Appellant did not seek to avail itself of the government's offer to produce the assistants. In these circumstances we find no basis for the argument that the testimony of the government's witness as to the existing depreciation and the accompanying exhibits should not be considered. The Secretary reviewed the method adopted by appellant's engineer as compared with that of the government's engineer and reached a reasoned conclusion upon all the evidence. We think that the evidence affords no sufficient ground for upsetting his finding.\n The remaining contention affecting the rate base is in relation to going concern value.\n Going Conern Value.-Appellant's witness, who testified at length at both hearings, followed an elaborate method involving assumptions and speculations of the sort which fail to furnish a sound basis for computing a separate allowance for that element. Compare Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 394\n, 42 S.Ct. 351; Los Angeles \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 63]\n\u00a0\n Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, supra, \n289 U.S. 287\n, at pages 314, 318, 319, 53 S.Ct. 637; Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 309\n, 54 S.Ct. 647; Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 398, 412\n, 54 S.Ct. 763, 91 A.L.R. 1403. The witness differentiated his method from the 'past deficit' method. Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra. He styled his method as 'the cost of reproduction method of evaluating the business.' It compared 'to the past deficit method in just exactly the same way that reproduction new of physical property compares to historical cost of physical property.' His calculations depended upon assumptions of theoretical future deficits. They involved elaborate guesswork, according to assumed valuations of physical plant, the length of time required for the complete recovery of the business, and the rate of retur . At the first hearing he computed the going concern value at $666,666. At the second hearing, by a similar method, he made various calculations dependent on assumed valuations of the property, that is, $294,000 on a total valuation of $5,000,000; $358, 000 on a valuation of approximately $3,500,000; and about $400,000, or approximately 22 1\/2 per cent. of the physical plant value, on a valuation of $2,000,000. That is, as he said, 'Depending upon the final value as fixed by the Secretary, the going value will range in approximately a straight line variation' between the limits 'of 22 1\/2 per cent. for a minimum value of $2,000,000, and 6 per cent. or $294,000 for a maximum value of $5,000,000.' The Secretary treated such speculations as 'in no real sense evidence.' We agree with that conclusion.\n Appellant contends, however, that the Secretary and the District Court erred in saying that appellant's claim is based wholly upon the testimony of this witness. Appellant strongly relies upon the fact that on the first hearing the Secretary made an allowance of $300,000 for \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 64]\n\u00a0\n going concern value and that in his answer in the first suit he denied that no evidence upon that subject had been offered on the Secretary's behalf, but, on the contrary, stated that much evidence was introduced by the Secretary tending to show the value of that element. That answer was made to the allegation that appellant was entitled to an allowance of at least $666,663, and the Secretary further answered that the separate allowance he had made was more than adequate.\n The Secretary was not estopped or controlled by the ruling in the first proceeding. He was entitled, and it was his duty, to reexamine the case on the second hearing and to reach the conclusion which the evidence justified. In that process, he in effect overruled the earlier allowance and left it without force. The question remains one of evidence. The Secretary recognized the fact that there is an element of value in an 'established plant doing business and earning money over one not thus advanced.' But he thought that in the rate base he had fixed there was an adequate allowance for that element and that it was 'inextricably interwoven with other values.' The government's argument in support of this view points to the overheads allowed and emphasizes the fact that the Secretary's method took as his basis reproduction cost, 'unmodified by considerations of actual or historical cost.' It is urged that the Secretary in fact made a liberal valuation which gave a margin large enough to cover the value inherent in a going concern.\n We think it unnecessary to review that argument in detail. The decisive point on this appeal is that, in seeking a separate allowance for going convern value, in addition to the value of the physical plant as found, and in maintaining that the property was being confiscated because of the absence of that allowance, it was incumbent upon appellant to furnish convincing proof. That proof we do not find in the record. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 65]\n\u00a0\n Operating Expenses.-The point of contention is the annual allowance for depreciation reserve. The argument that the Secretary was without authority to prescribe the amount of this allowance is obviously ineffectual. In fixing reasonable rates for the stockyards service it was necessary for the Secretary to ascertain the outlays which that service would require and the amount which should reasonably be reserved out of income to cover depreciation in the property used. It was also necessary for the Secretary in estimating the latter allowance to examine the history of the property and the amounts which in the course of appellant's operations had been found necessary for repairs and replacements. On the facts disclosed by the extensive evidence, the Secretary concluded that $ 80,000 was an adequate amount to be included in appellant's annual expenses 'to cover repairs and provision for depreciation reserve.' The Secretary had found that the amount expended for repairs on appellant's used and useful roperty for the preceding ten years had averaged about $ 38,500 a year. This finding does not appear to be contested, and from it appellant concludes that the Secretary has allowed the remainder of $80, 000, or $41,500, to be carried annually to the depreciation reserve account. Appellant insists that the yearly depreciation allowance should be not less than $100,000.\n On December 31, 1932, appellant had accumulated a depreciation reserve of $1,771,063. This reserve had been accumulated since 1914. In an appraisal made by the American Appraisal Company in 1922, on the basis of cost of reproduction new, the then existing depreciation was estimated at $ 621,171 and a reserve of that amount was then provided by a surplus adjustment. From that time until 1932 appellant set aside from $120,000 to $ 130,000 annually, making a total provided for depreciation since 1914 of about $1,887,000. In that entire period, by the computation of the government which does not seem to be \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 66]\n\u00a0\n controverted, there had been charged against the depreciation reserve for retirements only about $116,405, of which about $103,500 were for retirements in the period 1922 to 1932, inclusive. The government contends that the structural property in the pen areas, embracing pens, fences, runways, and other yard structures, had been kept in proper operating condition principally by ordinary repairs and piecemeal replacements. The government argues that the cost of reproduction new of this part of the property is approximately one-half of the reproduction cost of the entire property, and that from 1916 to 1932 the value of that portion of the property which was retired amounted to about $40,000. Appellant states that in 1926 to 1930, inclusive, the amount of pen structures which were retired was $41,639. On the other hand, it appears that the amount set up for depreciation on that class of assets was over $600,000.\n Whatever may be said of this or that detail, it is quite clear that the amounts carried annually to the depreciation reserve were excessive. The government's analysis tends to show that an average of approximately $ 47,000 annually would have been sufficient to take care of the repairs, maintenance, and retirements during the period for which the financial history of appellant is available, and that the Secretary's allowance of $ 80,000 for both repairs and depreciation reserve is about $33,000 in excess of the amount shown to be actually required on the basis of that experience.\n In the light of appellant's practice in accumulating an excessive reserve by its charges to operating expenses, a close examination was called for and a considerable deduction in the amount of such allowances in fixing reasonable rates was necessary. We have had occasion recently to discuss the general question of depreciation reserves at some length ( Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 67]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n292 \nU.S. 151\n, 54 S.Ct. 658), and we need not repeat what was there said. The question now presented is one of sound judgment upon the present record. We agree with the District Court that the Secretary endeavored to reach a fair conclusion and that the government's analysis is persuasive. The argument that the Secretary employed the sinking fund method and upon that basis made an inadequate allowance does not find support in his findings. It is apparent that he sought to make an allowance which according to the nature of the property and appellant's experience would be adequate to cover repairs and replacements with a further provision to maintain a reasonable depreciation reserve. The evidence and appellant's contentions with respect to it do not satisfy us that the Secretary reached an unjustified result.\n Income.-The Secretary allowed 7 per cent. as the rate of return and appellant presents no complaint as to that. Wabash Valley Electric Co. v. Young, \n287 \nU.S. 488, 502\n, 53 S.Ct. 234; Los Angeles Gas & Electric Co. v. Railroad Commission, supra, \n289 U.S. 287\n, at page 319, 53 S.Ct. 63 . Applying the rates he fixed, the Secretary estimated the annual gross income at.$621,831 and operating expenses, including the contribution to depreciation reserve as above stated, at $ 426,267, leaving a net balance of $195,564, slightly over 7 per cent. on the fair value of the property.\n Appellant's revenue is derived from yardage charges, from the sale of feed and bedding, and from special services. The Secretary made no change in the charges for miscellaneous services, such as loading and unloading, dipping and spraying, cleaning and disinfecting, etc. The revenue from these services was estimated at $90,500. The profit on sales of feed and bedding was estimated at $82,800. The yardage revenues are derived from charges (1) for yarding livestock arriving fresh from the country; (2) for yarding livestock resold or reweighed for purpose \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 68]\n\u00a0\n of sale; and (3) for the use of feed lot facilities. The reductions directed by the Secretary were in (1) and (2) and the revenue from the new rates for these services was estimated at $412,775. As to (3), for livestock held in the feed lots, the Secretary provided for an increase of charges, fixing maximum rates estimated to produce a revenue of $35,756.\n It appears that formerly the feed lots were leased, and on the first hearing before the Secretary their value was excluded from the rate base. After 1930 they were operated under appellant's supervision, and appellant filed its rates for their use. Accordingly, on the second hearing, the Secretary found that the feed lots were used and useful and included them in the rate base. The principal 'feeding business' is the feeding of sheep. The increase in rates, for which the Secretary provided, was from 15 cents and 35 cents per head for cattle (depending upon the use of sheds and other inclosures) to 60 cents, and from 5 cents per head for hogs and sheep to 38 cents. Despite the increase, appellant contends that the order as to feed lot charges is void; that there were no findings to support it and no true hearing; that the evidence did not sustain the Secretary's conclusions; and that, although the order was based upon a finding of unjust discrimination, there was no alternative permitted in removing it.\n It is manifest, however, that, when the feed lots were brought into the rate base, it was appropriate that the reasonableness of the charges for their use should be considered. This was part of the subject before the Secretary. In the order for reopening the proceeding, the Secretary had stated that a general inquiry would be made 'into the reasonableness and lawfulness of each and every rate and charge ... stated in any and all schedules of rates and charges filed by respondent' (appellant here). The Secretary found that 'under the existing schedule shippers of livestock who consign their animals to commission men' \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 69]\n\u00a0\n were charged more for the use of appellant's facilities 'in handling such livestock for a shorter period of time' than those who used the 'feed lots for a much longer period of time.' The Secretary found that the existing rates were 'unreasonable and unjustly discriminatory.' The feed lots were embraced in the tracts the value of which was estimated on a unit basis. The findings show appellant's operating expenses. We find no merit in the contentions that there was a lack of notice, or a lack of evidence as to the use of the feed lots or as to the discriminatory effect of the existing rates. We do not think that the decisions cited as to the affording of an alternative for the removal of discrimination are applicable to the present case. For the Secretary's action here was to provide for a reasonable charge for the use of the feed lots, so that those who did not use them should not bear an unreasonable burden. Whether appellant would be able to obtain the estimated revenue from the increased rates should be determined by a fair test of the permitted charges.\n The reductions by the Secretary were in the charges for yardage servic s. The Secretary made different reductions for rail and truck shipments, and this differentiation is challenged. For example, under the existing rates, appellant's charge was 35 cents per head of cattle received by rail and 40 cents per head received by truck. The Secretary reduced the charge to 27 cents as to the former and to 35 cents as to the latter. There are differences in the two sorts of receipts, in that in the one case there is a loading and unloading charge and, as detailed testimony showed, cattle received by rail consumed, as a rule, more feed than those received by truck. The evidence disclosed the services rendered in the case of cattle and othr livestock, and the question is simply as to a fair determination in the light of all the circumstances. If the rates as prescribed were not confiscatory, the classification of rates was clearly within the Secretary's statutory authority. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 70]\n\u00a0\n There is a separate contention with respect to the rates for yarding livestock which was resold or reweighed for the purpose of sale. Appellant states that the Secretary's charges differed from its own in only one instance; that is, that the former are 1.5 cents per head lower on calves, but, as the number of calves resold is negligible, that difference would not appreciably affect appellant's income. Appellant's tariff provided that on livestock resold in the commission division there would be an additional charge of one-half the yardage charges. The Secretary found that, despite this limitation, appellant in practice had imposed the charge on other resales, if they did not involve livestock 'to go to the country'; that is, bought by farmers to be fed. The government's contention is that the practice lacked uniformity. The Secretary concluded that to impose the charge on resales in the commission division, but not on those in the traders division or elsewhere in the yard, was unreasonable and constituted an unjust discrimination. Appellant insists that the Secretary overestimated the income from this source by $20,803. The controversy is over the number of livestock to which the charges for resales or reweighs for the purpose of sale would apply. The Secretary made a general estimate. He also found the number of head to which the charge would have been applicable in 1931 and 1932, and his estimate for the future was less than the average of those years. Appellant challenges the correctness of the computation and says that it rests upon an erroneous assumption that 'order buyers' would pay a resale charge. The government insists that the criticism is unjustified and points to evidence which is said to demonstrate conclusively that the Secretary's figures as to resales and reweighs are correct, and that appellant's argument is based on an application of the prescribed rates to 'the wrong volume.' It is unnecessary to recite the evidence. We think the government substantiates its point. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 71]\n\u00a0\n The remaining question is with respect to the effect of the reduction of the other yardage charges, that is, for the yarding of livestock arriving fresh from the country; and then whether upon the whole case there would be such a deficiency in revenue as to establish confiscation. The revenue, of course, depends upon the quantity of livestock handled. The Secretary considered the fluctuation in receipts for a period of twenty-four years. The government points to the statistical analysis as showing that cyclical fluctuations are characteristic of the business and that years of decline have been followed normally by an upward swing. The Secretary examined the actual receipts of each sort of livestock for the six years 1927 to 1932, inclusive. He did not attempt to make an exact prediction. Nor did he take an average of the six years. He took into consideration the lower volume of business in the later part of the period and made an estimate of the probable receipts which cannot be considered unfair. It was not an unsupported prophecy (compare West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 79, 82\n, 55 S.Ct. 324), but rather an endeavor to perform the essential duty of making 'an honest and intelligent forecast,' in view 'of all the relevant circumstances' ( Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 278\n, 43 S.Ct. 544, 546, 31 A.L.R. 807). Applying the factors thus arrived at, the Secretary found that the prescribed rates would yield revenue sufficient to give the return above mentioned.\n Appellant criticizes the Secretary's estimates and insists that the prescribed rates would have been confiscatory during the entire period which the Secretary considered, making separate calculations for the period 1927 to 1931, and for 1932. The government in turn points to necessary corrections in appellant's statements both of income and expenses, and with those adjustments shows that under the prescribed rates appellant would have had an average yearly net return, for 1927 to 1931, of approxi- \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 72]\n\u00a0\n mately $266,237, or about 9.7 per cent., and for the six-year period, 1927 to 1932, approximately $247,698, or about 9 per cent., on the fair value of its property as found. And, while considering it to be improper to take the year 1932-the worst year of the depression period-as the basis for estimating return, the government urges that, even in the abnormal conditions of that year, the prescribed rates would have produced a net return of 5.67 per cent.\n Appellant seeks to buttress its case by reference to results of operations in later years. Its brief attempts to present the transactions of 1935. But there is no evidence properly before us save that contained in the record before the Secretary. Upon that record appellant stood in the District Court, and upon that record appellant must stand here. The hearing before the Secretary, held in 1933, necessarily proceeded upon an examination of the operations of the preceding years. The Secretary examined the course of business for a period sufficiently ling to afford a basis for a reasonable estimate with due regard to the years preceding, and those during, the depression. His selection, and the use he made of it, is not open to any sound criticism. If the operations of later years show that the rates have become unreasonably low, appellant has its remedy. It has had, and still has, opportunity to apply to the Secretary of Agriculture for a modification of the prescribed charges. The only request for reopening the proceeding or for an adjustment of the rates, so far as now appears, was made early in 1934 prior to the order in question and before any adequate test of the rates.\n We conclude that the appellant has failed to prove confiscation, and the decree of the District Court is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS concurs in the result. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 73]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (concurring).\n I agree that the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed; but I do so on a different ground.\n The question on which I differ was put thus by the District Court: 'If in a judicial review of an order of the Secretary his findings supported by substantial evidence are conclusive upon the reviewing court in every case where a constitutional issue is not involved, why are they not conclusive when a constitutional issue is involved? Is there anything in the Constitution which expressly makes findings of fact by a jury of inexperienced laymen, if supported by substantial evidence, conclusive, that prohibits Congress making findings of fact by a highly trained and especially qualified administrative agency likewise conclusive, provided they are supported by substantial evidence?' 11 F.Supp. 322, 327.\n Like the lower court, I think no good reason exists for making special exception of issues of fact bearing upon a constitutional right. The inexorable safeguard which the due process clause assures is, not that a court may examine whether the findings as to value or income are correct, but that the trier of the facts shall be an impartial tribunal; that n finding shall be made except upon due notice and opportunity to be heard; that the procedure at the hearing shall be consistent with the essentials of a fair trial; and that it shall be conducted in such a way that there will be opportunity for a court to determine whether the applicable rules of law and procedure were observed.\n Suits to restrain or annul an order of the Secretary of Agriculture are governed by the provision which Congress has made for reviewing orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 U.S. 420\n, 432-433, 442-444, 50 S.Ct. 220. That provision does not, in my opinion, permit a district court \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 74]\n\u00a0\n to set aside an order on the ground that the Secretary erred in making a finding of fact; and the jurisdiction of this Court to review its judgment is necessarily subject to the same limitation. As the District Court concluded that no applicable rule of law was disregarded by the Secretary, that for hisfindings there was ample support in the evidence, that, taken together, they support his conclusion that the rates are compensatory, and that the proceeding was in no respect irregular, it was in duty bound to dismiss the bill without enquiring into the correctness of his findings of subsidiary facts.\n First. An order of the Secretary may, of course, be set aside for violation of the due process clause by prescribing rates which, on the facts found, are confiscatory; for the order of an administrative tribunal may be set aside for any error of law, substantive or procedural. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R.R., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S.Ct. 108. Moreover, where what purports to be a finding upon a question of fact is so involved with and dependent upon questions of law as to be in substance and effect a decision of the latter, the Court will, in order to decide the legal question, examine the entire record, including the evidence if necessary, as it does in cases coming from the highest court of a state. Compare Kansas City Southern Ry. v. C. H. Albers Commission Co., \n223 \nU.S. 573, 591\n, 32 S.Ct. 316; Cedar Rapids Gas Light Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 U.S. 655\n, 668-669, 32 S.Ct. 389. It may set aside an order for lack of findings necessary to support it, Florida v. United States, \n282 U.S. 194\n, 212-215, 51 S.Ct. 119; or because findings were made without evidence to support them, New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 203\n, 43 S.Ct. 270; Chicago Junction Case, \n264 U.S. 258\n, 262-266, 44 S.Ct. 317; or because the evidence was such 'that it was impossible for a fairminded board to come to the result which was reached,' San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 442\n, 23 S.Ct. 571, 572; or because the \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 75]\n\u00a0\n order was based on evidence not legally cognizable, United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry., \n265 U.S. 274\n, 286-290, 44 S.Ct. 565; or because facts and circumstances which ought to have been considered were excluded from consideration, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Northern Pacific Ry., \n216 \nU.S. 538, 544\n, 545 S., 30 S.Ct. 417; Northern Pacific Ry. v. Department of Public Works, \n268 \nU.S. 39, 44\n, 45 S. Ct. 412; or because facts and circumstances were considered which could not legally influence the conclusion, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 \nU.S. 42, 46\n, 47 S., 32 S.Ct. 22; Florida East Coast Ry. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 167, 187\n, 34 S.Ct. 867; or because it applied a rule thought wrong for determining the value of the property, St. Louis & O'Fallon Ry. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 461\n, 49 S.Ct. 384. These cases deal with errors of law or irregularities of procedure.\n Second. The contention of the appellant is that the Secretary of Agriculture erred in making findings on which rest his conclusion that the rates prescribed are compensatory. The matters here in controversy are ques ions of fact-subsidiary issues, about 63 in number, bearing upon two main issues of fact: What is the 'value' of the property used and useful in the business? What will be the income earned on that valuation if the prescribed rates are put into force?\n By the Packers and Stockyards Act, the duty of investigating and determining the facts was committed by Congress to the Secretary. It was not disputed that ordinarily his findings made upon substantial evidence in properly conducted proceedings are conclusive. Tagg Brothers & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420, 444\n, 50 S.Ct. 220. This Court has consistently declared in cases arising under the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.) that to 'consider the weight of the evidence is beyond our province,' Western Paper Makers' Chemical Co. v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 268, 271\n, 46 S.Ct. 500, 501; Chicago, R.I. & Pac. Ry. v. United \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 76]\n\u00a0\n States, \n274 \nU.S. 29, 33\n, 34 S., 47 S.Ct. 486; and that courts have no concern with the correctness of the Commission's reasoning, with the soundness of its conclusions of fact, or with the alleged inconsistency of the findings with those made in other proceedings, Virginian Ry. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 663\n, 665 S., 666, 47 S.Ct. 222. Compare People of State of New York ex rel. New York & Queens Gas Co. v. McCall, \n245 \nU.S. 345, 348\n, 38 S.Ct. 122; Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 625, 634\n, 43 S.Ct. 680; Silberschein v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 221, 225\n, 45 S. Ct. 69; Ma-King Products Co. v. Blair, \n271 \nU.S. 479, 483\n, 46 S.Ct. 544.\n The cases are numerous in which The attempt was made to induce this Court to annul an order of the Commission for error of fact; but in every case relief was denied. See St. Louis & O'Fallon Ry. v. United States, \n279 U.S. 461\n, 493, note 8, 49 S.Ct. 384. In this case also the Court refuses to set aside the order. But it declares that an exception to the rule of finality must be made, because a constitutional issue is involved, and that the Court, weighing the evidence, must in its independent judgment determine the correctness of the findings of fact made by the Secretary. That view finds support in Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287\n, 40 S.Ct. 527, and in general statements made in Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 U.S. 457\n, 488-490, 38 S.Ct. 383, and other cases; but it is inconsistent with a multitude of decisions in analogous cases hereafter discussed.\n Third. The Fifth Amendment, like the Fourteenth, declares that property may not be taken without due process of law. But there is nothing in the text of the Constitution (including the Amendments) which tells the reader whether to constitute due process it is necessary that there be opportunity for a judicial review of the correctness of the findings of fact made by the Secretary of Agriculture concerning the value of this property or its net income. To learn what the procedure must be in a particular situation, in order to constitute due process, we \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 77]\n\u00a0\n turn necessarily to the decisions of our Court. These tell us that due process does not require that a decision made by an appropriate tribunal shall be reviewable by another. Pittsburgh, etc., Ry. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421, 426\n, 427 S., 14 S.Ct. 1114; Reetz v. Michigan, \n188 \nU.S. 505, 508\n, 23 S.Ct. 390; Dohany v. Rogers, \n281 \nU.S. 362, 369\n, 50 S.Ct. 299, 68 A.L.R. 434. They tell us that due process is not necessarily judicial process. Den ex dem. Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 280; McMillen v. Anderson, \n95 U.S. 37\n, 41; United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253, 263\n, 25 S.Ct. 644. And they draw distinctions which give clear indication when due process requires judicial process and when it does not.\n The first distinction is betw en issues of law and issues of fact. When dealing with constitutional rights (as distinguished from privileges accorded by the government, United States v. Babcock, \n250 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 39 S.Ct. 464), there must be the opportunity of presenting in an appropriate proceeding, at some time, to some court, every question of law raised, whatever the nature of the right invoked or the status of him who claims it. The second distinction is between the right to liberty of person and other constitutional rights. Compare Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 596\n, 597 S., 51 S.Ct. 608. A citizen who claims that his liberty is being infringed is entitled, upon habeas corpus, to the opportunity of a judicial determination of the facts. And, so highly is this liberty prized, that the opportunity must be accorded to any resident of the United States who claims to be a citizen. Compare Ng Fung Ho v. White, \n259 U.S. 276\n, 282-285, 42 S.Ct. 492, with United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253\n, 25 S.Ct. 644, and Tang Tun v. Edsell, \n223 \nU.S. 673, 675\n, 32 S.Ct. 359. But a multitude of decisions tells us that when dealing with property a much more liberal rule applies. They show that due process of law does not always entitle an owner to have the correctness of findings of fact reviewed by a court, and that, in deciding whether such review is required, 'respect must be had to \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 78]\n\u00a0\n the cause and object of the taking, whether under the taxing power, the power of eminent domain, or the power of assessment for local improvements, or none of these; and if found to be suitable or admissible in the special case, it will be adjudged to be 'due process of law.\" Mr. Justice Bradley, in Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 107.\n Our decisions tell us specifically that the final ascertainment of the facts regarding value or income may be submitted by Congress, or state legislatures, to an administrative tribunal, even where the constitutionality of the taking depends upon the value of the property or the amount of the net income. Thus:\n\n\n (a)\n No taking of property by eminent domain is constitutional unless just compensation is paid. But in condemnation proceedings the value of the property, and hence the amount payable therefor, need not be determined by a court. 'By the constitution of the United States, the estimate of the just conpensation for property taken for the public use, under the right of eminent domain, is not required to be made by a jury, but may be intrusted by congress to commissioners appointed by a court or by the executive or to an inquest consisting of more or fewer men than an ordinary jury.' Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548, 593\n, 17 S.Ct. 966, 983. In Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 \nU.S. 685, 695\n, 17 S.Ct. 718, 722, it was said that 'there is no denial of due process in making the findings of fact by the triors of fact, whether commissioners or a jury, final as to such facts, and leaving open to the courts simply the inquiry as to whether there was any erroneous basis adopted by the triors in their appraisal, or other errors in their proceedings.' In Crane v. Hahlo, \n258 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 42 S.Ct. 214, 216, the Court said in applying the same rule to a statute which allowed a judicial review of the facts only in case of 'lack of jurisdiction, or fraud, or willful misconduct on the part of the members of the board': 'This \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 79]\n\u00a0\n afforded ample protection for the fundamental rights of the plaintiff in error, and the taking away of the right to have examined mere claims of honest error in the conduct of the proceeding by the board did not invade any federal constitutional right.' See, also, United States v. Jones, \n109 \nU.S. 513, 519\n, 3 S.Ct. 346; Backus v. Fort Street Union Depot Co., \n169 \nU.S. 557, 569\n, 18 S.Ct. 445.\n\n\n (b)\n No taking of property by taxation is constitutional unless the exaction is laid according to value, in ome, or other measure prescribed by law. But Congress has, with the sanction of this Court, broadly given finality to the determination by the Board of Tax Appeals of the facts concerning income. By its legislation the jurisdiction of courts is limited to deciding 'whether the correct rule of law was applied to the facts found; and whether there was substantial evidence before the Board to support the findings made.' Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123, 131\n, 55 S.Ct. 732, 736; Old Mission Portland Cement Co. v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 289, 294\n, 55 S.Ct. 158. Compare Cheatham v. United States, \n92 \nU.S. 85, 88\n, 89 S.. No court may pass upon the correctness in fact of any finding of the Board.\n\n\n (c)\n The due process clause is not violated by giving in tariff acts finality to the valuations made by appraisers of imported merchandise belonging to American citizens. Hilton v. Merritt, \n110 \nU.S. 97, 107\n, 3 S. Ct. 548. 'It was certainly competent for congress,' said the Court in Passavant v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 214, 219\n, 13 S.Ct. 572, 575, 'to create this board of general appraisers, called 'legislative referees' in an early case in this court (Rankin v. Hoyt, 4 How. 327, 335 (11 L.Ed. 996)), and not only invest them with authority to examine and decide upon the valuation of imported goods, when that question was properly submitted to them, but to declare that their decision 'shall be final and conclusive as to the dutiable value of such merchandise against all parties intertested therein.\" \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 80]\n\u00a0\n (d) The due process clause is not violated by legislation which requires a fire insurance policy to provide that the amount of the loss ( and hence values) shall be determined by a board of appraisers; and that their decision, if not grossly excessive, or inadequate, or procured by fraud, shall be conclusive as to the amount of the loss. Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Glidden Co., \n284 \nU.S. 151\n, 52 S.Ct. 69.\n\n\n (e)\n The due process clause is not violated by giving finality to assessments of value made for the purpose of ad valorem taxation, although in those proceedings the opportunity for a hearing is far less ample than under the statute here in question. Compare State Railroad Tax Cases, \n92 U.S. 575\n, 610; Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 321\n, 6 S. Ct. 57; King v. Mullins, \n171 U.S. 404\n, 429-431, 18 S.Ct. 925.\n As we said in San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 23 S.Ct. 571, 574: 'We do not sit as a general appellate board of revision for all rates and taxes in the United States'; and in Coulter v. Louisville & Nashville R.R., \n196 \nU.S. 599, 607\n, 25 S.Ct. 342, 344: 'Of course, no court would venture to intervene merely on the ground of a mistake of judgment on the part of the officer to whom the duty of assessment was intrusted by the law.'\n Answering the suggestion of possible error in the final action of a board in valuing and assessing railroad property, the Court said in Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 321, 335\n, 6 S.Ct. 57, 62: 'Such possibilities are but the necessary imperfections of all human institutions, and do not admit of remedy; at least no revisory power to prevent or redress them enters into the judicial system, for, by the supposition, its administration is itself subject to the same imperfections.' In Crane v. Hahlo, \n258 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 42 S.Ct. 214, 216, the Court, intimating that even judges may err in their determinations of fact, held that legislators might, \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 81]\n\u00a0\n in proceeding for the taking of property, act on 'the policy that the greater good is sometimes secured by making certain classes of decisions final and ending litigation, even though in a particular case the individual is prevented by review from correcting some error which has injured him.'\n These cases show that in deciding when, and to what extent, finality may be given to an administrative finding o fact involving the taking of property, the Court has refused to be governed by a rigid rule. It has weighed the relative values of constitutional rights, the essentials of powers conferred, and the need of protecting both. It has noted the distinction between informal, summary administrative action based on ex parte casual inspection or unverified information, where no record is preserved of the evidence on which the official acted, and formal, deliberate quasi judicial decisions of administrative tribunals based on findings of fact expressed in writing, and made after hearing evidence and argument under the sanctions and the safeguards attending judicial proceedings. It has considered the nature of the facts in issue, the character of the relevant evidence, the need in the business of government for prompt final decision. It has recognized that there is a limit to the capacity of judges, and that the magnitude of the task imposed upon them, if there be granted judicial review of the correctness of findings of such facts as value and income, may prevent prompt and faithful performance. It has borne in mind that even in judicial proceedings the finding of facts is left, by the Constitution, in large part to laymen. It has inquired into the character of the administrative tribunal provided and the incidents of its procedure. Compare Humphrey's Executor v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 602, 608\n, 55 S.Ct. 869. And, where that prescribed for the particular class of takings appeared 'appropriate to the case, and just to the parties to be \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 82]\n\u00a0\n affected,' and 'adapted to the end to be attained,' Hagar v. Reclamation District, \n111 \nU.S. 701, 708\n, 4 S.Ct. 663, 667, the Court has held it constitutional to make the findings of fact of the administrative tribunal conclusive. Thus the Court has followed the rule of reason.\n Fourth. Congress concluded that to give finality to the findings of the Secretary of Agriculture of the facts as to value and income is essential to the effective administration of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C.A.  181-229). The Ben Avon Case, and the statements in Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, and casual references in other cases, should not lead us to graft upon the rule discussed, and so widely applied to other takings, a disabling exception applicable to rate cases. In none of the rate cases relied upon was there may reason given for denying to Congress that power; nor was there mention of the many decisions in which the power to prescribe finality was upheld. In none was there noted the distinction between challenging the correctness of findings of fact on which rest the conclusion as to confiscation and challenging the conclusion of law as to confiscation on facts found. Here some reasons have been offered in support of making the exception; but no reason given seems to me sound.\n\n\n (a)\n It is urged that, since Congress did not, and could not, delegate to the Secretary authority to prescribe a confiscatory rate, the facts in issue are jurisdictional, and hence the Court must have power to review them. But as was said in Oklahoma Operating Co. v. Love, \n252 \nU.S. 331, 336\n, 40 S.Ct. 338, 340: 'The challenge of a prescribed rate as being confiscatory raises a question, not as to the scope of the Commission's authority, but of the correctness of the exercise of its judgment.' Therefore Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22\n, 52 S.Ct. 285, has no application here.\n\n\n (b)\n It is said that, since regulating rates is legislation, courts must have the same power to review facts which they possess in passing on the constitutionality of \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 83]\n\u00a0\n statutes-otherwise the supremacy of law could be impaired by delegation to an administrative tribunal of a power to make final determinations that the legislature lacks. To that argument there are several answers. It fails to note that a rate order may be complained of as being confiscatory, not because of error in a finding of value or income, but because the r gulating body has, in reaching its conclusions, ignored established principles or incontestable facts, or been guilty of dishonesty or of other irregularity in the proceeding. Whenever a legislative body regulates a subject within the scope of its power, a presumption of constitutionality prevails, in the absence of some factual foundation of record for overthrowing the regulation, O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251, 257\n, 258 S., 51 S.Ct. 130, 72 A.L. R. 1163; and this rule extends to such action by an administrative body, Pacific States Box & Basket Co. v. White, \n296 \nU.S. 176, 185\n, 186 S., 56 S.Ct. 159, 101 A.L.R. 853. If there be in the record conflicting evidence as to the facts assumed, a court may not substitute its independent judgment for that of the legislative body. Mere denial of facts relied upon as conditioning the validity of legislation does not confer upon a court authority to decide what is called the truth; that is, the absolute existence in reality of facts alleged. 'Where the constitutional validity of a statute depends upon the existence of facts, courts must be cautious about reaching a conclusion respecting them contrary to that reached by the Legislature; and if the question of what the facts established be a fairly debatable one, it is not permissible for the judge to set up his opinion in respect of it against the opinion of the lawmaker.' Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 44 S.Ct. 325, 326. Here the Court's duty is to determine merely whether there was evidence upon which reasonable men could have found as the Secretary did, with regard to value and income. Obviously the case at bar is not one in which 'it was \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 84]\n\u00a0\n impossible for a fair-minded board to come to the result which was reached.' Compare Van Dyke v. Geary, \n244 \nU.S. 39, 48\n, 49 S., 37 S.Ct. 483, 487.\n Moreover, argument based on the analogy of the review of statutes fails to note the distinction between determinations of fact made in a quasi judicial proceeding surrounded by all the safeguards which attend trials by a court, and assumptions, or conclusions, as to facts made by a Legislature on information which lacks those safeguards. It fails to note also the subsidiary character of the issue involved in a finding of value or income; and that it is only as to these subsidiary issues that finality of the finding is asserted here.\n The supremacy of law demands that there shall be opportunity to have some court decide whether an erroneous rule of law was applied and whether the proceeding in which facts were adjudicated was conducted regularly. To that extent, the person asserting a right, whatever its source, should be entitled to the independent judgment of a court on the ultimate question of constitutionality. But supremacy of law does not demand that the correctness of every finding of fact to which the rule of law is to be applied shall be subject to review by a court. If it did, the power of courts to set aside findings of fact by an administrative tribunal would be broader than their power to set aside a jury's verdict. The Constitution contains no such command.\n Fifth. The history of this case illustrates that regulation cannot be effective unless the legality of the rates prescribed may, if contested, be determined with reasonable promptness. Six and one-half years have elapsed since the Secretary of Agriculture concluded that the rates of this utility were so high as to justify inquiry into their reasonableness, and nearly two years since entry of his order prescribing the reduced rates. In the judgment of the lower court and of this Court the attack upon the order \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 85]\n\u00a0\n reducing them was unwarranted. But the rates of 1929 have remained in force; and, despite the supersedeas and injunction bonds, there will be practically no redress for the wrong done to the business community throughout the long years in which excessive rates have been exacted. Neither party is chargeable with lack of dil gence in the investigation or litigation; and there is no suggestion of undue delay on the part of either court. The long delay is due to other causes.\n The investigation of the company's rates was ordered October 9, 1929. The hearing began December 2, 1929. All the subsidiary inquiries of fact commonly incident to applying the rule of Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S.Ct. 418, were entered upon. After the hearing had closed, the company sought to have it reopened for the admission of evidence showing how the changed conditions of business since 1929 would affect plaintiff's income and the net return on the property used. This application was refused by the Secretary; and he entered an order fixing maximum rates, which, on his valuation of the property and estimate of earnings, would have yielded a return of 7 1\/2 per cent. if in effect in 1928. Thereupon the company filed a bill in the District Court to set aside the order on the ground that it would deprive petitioner of its property in violation of the due process clause. That court heard additional evidence, as well as receiving the record of the proceedings before the Secretary. It considered, but did not pass on, the merits; for it set aside the order on the ground that the Secretary should have acceded to the request to reopen the hearings. St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, 58 F.(2d) 290. The new hearing was begun January 10, 1933, and did not close until February 16, 1933. Thereafter the Secretary entered the order here under review; and the second suit followed which is here on appeal. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 86]\n\u00a0\n Sixth. The abstract of record made before the Secretary and submitted to the District Court for review consisted of 1,648 printed pages of evidence, besides 111 exhibits, many being extensive. Twenty-two witnesses testified orally. The 71 exhibits certified to this Court alone comprise 1, 358 pages of tabulations or like detail. In addition, they contain 18 graphs, 30 maps or photographs, and 600 pages of reading matter. Consideration of most of the evidence presented to the Secretary was deemed essential to a proper determination by the District Court of the issues of fact now controverted. Consideration of most of the evidence introduced below is now deemed by counsel necessary for a proper decision of the case by this Court. The condensed narrative statement of the evidence other than exhibits fills 721 pages of the printed record in this Court. Seventy-one exhibits (although not required to be printed) were required to be transmitted to this Court as a part of the record before us. The number of pages of the evidence (including exhibits) before us bearing more or less specifically upon the question of confiscation is 2,717. The total number of pages-briefs, exhibits, and evidence-before this Court is 3,466.\n The magnitude of the task involved in a judicial review which requires a determination by the Court, in its independent judgment, of the correctness of the findings of fact as to value and income which the Secretary made, cannot be measured by looking alone at the volume of the evidence. The multiplicity of the issues and the character of the evidence bearing on them respectively impose a peculiar burden. The findings as numbered and lettered by the Secretary total 215. The number of determinations of fact bearing upon confiscation involved in these findings is, roughly, 250, as gathered from the 108-page opinion of the Secretary. To decide whether any one of these 250 determinations of fact alleged to be errone- \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 87]\n\u00a0\n ous is, or is not, correct, involves separate examination of the evidence relating specifically to it; since as to each of these determinations the reviewing court is called upon to make a decision, in the exercise of an independent judgment. Such a decision involves, in many cases, weighing specific evidence and resolving conflicts.\n\n\n (a)\n There is controversy as to the extent to which property owned by the company is used or useful. That inquiry relates to 52 differ nt items. The testimony and exhibits bearing upon this issue occupy 194 pages. On it there are approximately 50 findings. The correctness of only one of these is controverted here.\n\n\n (b)\n There is controversy as to the value of the land. It consists of 60 different tracts. The testimony and exhibits bearing upon their value occupy 596 pages (the exhibits number 20). On this issue there are about 10 findings. The correctness of 3 is controverted here, dealing with the land in a single 'zone.'\n\n\n (c)\n There is controversy as to the value of the structures. It deals with reproduction costs; it requires separate consideration of materials and labor, of overheads and depreciation. The testimony and exhibits occupy 629 pages (the exhibits number 12). On these issues there are some 40 findings. Those dealing with depreciation are controverted here.\n\n\n (d)\n There is controversy as to going concern value. The testimony and exhibits on this issue occupy 113 pages. The Secretary decided that no separate allowance should be made. That conclusion is controverted here.\n\n\n (e)\n There are controversies as to the estimated income, as to the expenses, and as to charges. The testimony and exhibits bearing upon them occupy, in the aggregate 663 pages (the exhibits number 42). On these issues there are approximately 140 determinations. Of these about 50 seem to be controverted here. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 88]\n\u00a0\n The decisions by the reviewing court on the correctness of many of these determinations must depend upon its judgment as to the credibility of the witnesses. For instance, the company insists, as to the land in one zone, that it is worth, on the average, 25 cents per square foot. The Secretary found it was worth 16 cents. On that issue five witnesses testified.\n This case, like a laboratory experiment, presents the task of rate regulation in its simplest form. The rates to be regulated are but few in number. The rate base is ordinary stockyard property small in extent as compared with some plants. The Secretary valued it at $2,743,000; and the company claims it is worth $1,010,406 more. The Secretary found that, at the prescribed rates, the receipts would yield a net income of $195,564; the company claims that it would not have been more then $81,026 in 1932 had these rates been in effect. But, under the prevailing view, an inquiry of the scope described was necessary, although involving hearings and lawsuits so protracted as to frustrate rateregulation.\n Seventh. The greater delay and the cost in rate investigations affecting the larger utilities is illustrated by cases which have come before this Court in recent years.\n\n\n (a)\n Chicago Telephone Rates. On September 13, 1921, the Illinois Commerce Commission, the regulating body, issued an order that the company show cause why its rates should not be reduced. The hearing began November 17, 1921, and closed July 31, 1923. On August 16, 1923, the commission entered an order reducing the rates, to become effective October 1, 1923. Before that date, enforcement was enjoined by the federal court on a bill which charged that the rates prescribed were confiscatory. On April 30, 1934, this Court sustained the validity of the rate order entered August 16, 1923. Thus the rates became effective twelve and a half years after the com- \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 89]\n\u00a0\n mencement of the investigation and nearly eleven years after they were prescribed.\n On June 11, 1934, the District Court ordered the company to reimburse consumers who had been charged excessive rates a sum estimated, in April, 1936, as almost $19,000,000; and on July 23, 1934, directed that the lawyers who appeared for the consumers in and after 1929 should receive as fees an amount equal to 7 1\/2 per cent. of the refunds. By March 31, 1936, 1,153,515 payments had been made. The task of making the refunds, only three-quarters complete has required a special force of 2,000 of the company's employees, and is said to have cost it (to November 30, 1935) $2, 575,412.89. Over $2,100,000 remains to be disposed of or paid.\n The transcript of evidence and arguments at the hearing before the Illinois commission fills about 4,500 pages; and there were besides more than 200 elaborate exhibits. The presentation of the evidence before the District Court at the first hearing on the merits occupied more than two months, resulting in a printed record of over 3,000 pages of testimony and 281 elaborate exhibits. The taking of depositions for presentation to that court on the second hearing on the merits, and other preparations for trial, took over a year. The hearing itself occupied five months, and resulted in a record of 16,168 pages. The record on the first appeal to this Court consisted of seven large volumes. The record of the additional evidence on the second appeal to this Court filled nine volumes; and the appellant's brief here, with appendix, nearly 700 pages.\n The investigation of rates for Chicago continues. On July 10, 1934, the commission asked the company to show cause why its rates should not be reduced. The latter spent over a year and a half preparing its case for presentation to the commission at a cost, including a new appraisal and inventory, of more than $1,200,000. Hearings are now in progress. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 90]\n\u00a0\n For the history of the investigation and litigation, see in this Court, Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel.

In the winter of 1919 the company increased its rates. Protests followed; and on October 18, 1920, hearings thereon began be fore the Public Service Commission. On March 3, 1922, a temporary order slightly reducing certain rates issued. Enforcement was enjoined by the federal court on a bill which charged that the rates prescribed were confiscatory. Since that time the rates prescribed, and to be prescribed, have been continuously under investigation and litigation.\n Before the commission there were, between 1920 and 1926, 189 days of hearings, 450 witnesses being examined orally. The evidence introduced fills, in the aggregate 26,417 pages; and there were, in addition, 1,043 elaborate exhibits, one alone being in 22 volumes. Hearings were also held from January 28, 1930, to April 18, 1930. The opinions of the commission in these proceedings fill 396 pages. In the District Court the hearings before the master occupied 416 days and extended over a period of four years; 610 witnesses being examined orally. They were recalled a total of 688 times. The evidence of that hearing fills 36,893 pages; and there were in addition 3,324 exhibits. The decree below was entered November \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 91]\n\u00a0\n 7, 1929. The company's counsel then labored two years in preparing a draft of the condensed narrative statement of the evidence required for the transcript of record on the appeal to this Court. On submitting this draft to counsel for the commission, the city, and the state, many errors were discovered. On 3,000 of the items counsel disagreed; months were devoted to composing the differences; and finally the items on which counsel could not agree were settled by the lower court. On November 14, 1933, more tha four years after entry of the decree appealed from, the company filed here a record of 5,700 pages. On February 19, 1934, that appeal was dismissed.\n On May 2, 1934, the commission instituted a new investigation into the rates of the company. Hearings began May 10, 1934, and are still going on. The subjects covered are again those required by the rule of Smyth v. Ames-reproduction cost, going value, depreciation, and so forth. Up to April 14, 1936, 86 hearings had been had, stretching through every month but one since the beginning of the inquiry, 140 witnesses had been heard, and 10,840 pages of testimony taken. The exhibits already intrtoduced total 397, one being in 34 volumes.\n For the history of the investigation and litigation, see in this Court, City of New York v. New York Tel.

In deciding whether the Constitution prevents Congress from giving finality to findings as to value or income where confiscation is alleged, the Court must consider the effect of our decisions, not only upon the function of rate regulation, but also upon the administrative and judicial tribunals themselves. Responsibility is the great developer of men. May it not tend to emasculate or demoralize the rate-making body if ultimate responsibility is transferred to others? To the capacity of men there is a limit. May it not impair the quality of the work of the courts if this heavy task of reviewing questions of fact is assumed?\n The obstacles encountered in the case at bar and in the regulation of the rates of the large utilities are attributable, in the main, to the Court's adherence to the rule declared in Smyth v. Ames for determining the value of the property. In State of Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 289\n, 43 S.Ct. 544, 31 A.L.R. 807, I stated my reasons for believing that the Constitution did not require the Court to adopt that rule which so seriously impairs the power of rate regulation. But, since the decision of Smyth v. Ames is adhered to, there is the greater need of applying to cases in which rate regulation is alleged to be confiscatory the rule of reason \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 93]\n\u00a0\n under which the Court has sanctioned, in other cases of taking, the legislative provision giving finality to quasi judicial findings of value and income by administrative tribunals.\n Surely all must agree with the Secretary of Agriculture that: 'If rate regulation is to be effective, there must come at some time an end of hearings and a decis on of the questions involved.' In Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Ry. v. Babcock, \n204 \nU.S. 585, 598\n, 27 S.Ct. 326, 329, we said of valuations made by the state board of equalization and assessment: 'Within its jurisdiction, except, as we have said, in the case of fraud or a clearly shown adoption of wrong principles, it is the ultimate guardian of certain rights. The State confided those rights to its protection and has trusted to its honor and capacity as it confides the protection of other social relations to the courts of law. Somewhere there must be an end.' Congress concluded that a wealthy and litigious utility might practically nullify rate regulation if the correctness of findings by the regulating body of the facts as to value and income were made subject to judicial review. For that conclusion experience affords ample basis. I cannot believe that the Constitution, which confers upon Congress the power of rate regulation, denies to it power to adopt measures indispensable to its effective exercise.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO (concurring in the result).\n We think the opinion of Mr. Justice BRANDEIS states the law as it ought to be, though we appreciate the weight of precedent that has now accumulated against it. If the opinion of the Court did no more than accept those precedents and follow them, we might be moved to acquiescence. More, however, has been attempted. The opinion re-examines the foundations of the rule that it declares, and finds them to be firm and true. We will not go so far. \n\n[298 U.S. 38, 94]\n\u00a0\n The doctrine of stare decisis, however appropriate and even necessary at times, has only a limited application in the field of constitutional law. See the cases collected by BRANDEIS, J., dissenting, in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393, 407\n, 408 S., 52 S.Ct. 443. If the challenged doctrine is to be reconsidered, we are unwilling to approve it.\n For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice BRANDEIS the decree should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, Denver Union Stock Yard Co. v.

Donnelly, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit, brought in the federal court for southern California, challenges the validity, under the Twenty-First Amendment of the Federal Constitution, of the provisions of a statute of that state, and of the regulations thereunder, which impose a license-fee of $500 for the privilege of importing beer to any place within its borders. \n1\n The license does not confer the privilege of selling. \n2\n Compare Premier-Pabst Sales Co. v. Grosscup, \n298 \nU.S. 226\n, 56 S.Ct. 754\n\n\n The plaintiffs are domestic corporations and individual citizens of California who sue on behalf of themselves and of others similarly situated. Each is engaged in selling at wholesale at one or more places of business within the \n\n[299 U.S. 59, 61]\n\u00a0\n state beer imported from Missouri or Wisconsin; and has a wholesaler's license which entitles the holder to sell there to licensed dealers beer lawfully possessed, whether it be imported or is of domestic make. For that license the fee is $50. Each plaintiff has refused to apply for an importer's license, claiming that the requirement discriminates against wholesalers of imported beer; and that, hence, the statute violates both the commerce clause and the equal protection clause. The bill alleges that heavy penalties are exacted for importing, or having in possession, imported beer without having secured an importer's license; that unless enjoined defendants will enforce the statute; that enforcement would subject each of the plaintiffs to irreparable injury; and that the matter in controversy exceeds $3,000.\n The several state officials charged with the duty of enforcing the statute were joined as defendants, and made return to an order to show cause. They assert that the challenged statutory provisions and regulations are valid because of the Twenty-First Amendment, ratified December 5, 1933, which provides by section 2: 'The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.'\n First. The main contention of the plaintiffs is that the exaction of the importer's license fee violates the commerce clause (Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3) by discriminating against the wholesaler of imported beer. But there is no discrimination against them qua wholesalers. Every one holding a wholesaler's license who is lawfully possessed of any beer may sell it. The fee exacted for the privilege of selling, and the conditions under which a sale may be made, are the same whether the beer to be sold is imported or domestic, or is both. The difference in position charged as a discrimination is not in the terms under which beer may be sold. \n\n[299 U.S. 59, 62]\n\u00a0\n It arises from the fact that no one may import beer without securing a license therefor. What the plaintiffs complain of is the refusal to let them import beer without paying for the privilege of importation. Prior to the Twenty-First Amendment it would obviously have been unconstitutional to have imposed any fee for that privilege. The imposition would have been void, not because it resulted in discrimination, but because the fee would be a direct burden on interstate commerce; and the commerce clause confers the right to import merchandise free into any state, except as Congress may otherwise provide. The exaction of a fee for the privilege of importation would not, before the Twenty-First Amendment, have been permissible even if the state had exacted an equal fee for the privilege of transporting domestic beer from its place of manufacture to the wholesaler's place of business. Compare State Freight Tax Case, 15 Wall. 232, 274, 277. Thus, the case does not present a question of discrimination prohibited by the commerce clause.\n The amendment which 'prohibited' the 'transportation or importation' of intoxicating liquors into any state 'in violation of the laws thereof,' abrogated the right to import free, so far as concerns intoxicating liquors. The words used are apt to confer upon the state the power to forbid all importations which do not comply with the conditions which it prescribes. The plaintiffs ask us to limit this broad command. They request us to construe the amendment as saying, in effect: The state may prohibit the importation of intoxicating liquors provided it prohibits the manufacture and sale within its boarders; but if it permits such manufacture and sale, it must let imported liquors compete with the domestic on equal terms. To say that, would involve not a construction of the amendment, but a rewriting of it. \n\n[299 U.S. 59, 63]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiffs argue that, despite the amendment, a state may not regulate importations except for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety, or morals; and that the importer's license fee was not imposed to that end. Surely the state may adopt a lesser degree of regulation than total prohibition. Can it be doubted that a state might establish a state monopoly of the manufacture and sale of beer, and either prohibit all competing importations, or discourage importation by laying a heavy impost, or channelize desired importations by confining them to a single consignee? Compare Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36; Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. (No. 1), \n170 \nU.S. 438, 447\n, 18 S.Ct. 674. There is no basis for holding that it may prohibit, or so limit, importation only if it establishes monopoly of the liquor trade. It might permit the manufacture and sale of beer, while prohibiting absolutely hard liquors. If it may permit the domestic manufacture of beer and exclude all made without the state, may it not, instead of absolute exclusion, subject the foreign article to a heavy importation fee? Moreover, in the light of history, we cannot say that the exaction of a high license fee for importation may not, like the imposition of the high license fees exacted for the privilege of selling at retail, serve as an aid in policing the liquor traffic. Compare Phillips v. City of Mobile, \n208 \nU.S. 472, 479\n, 28 S.Ct. 370.\n The plaintiffs argue that limitation of the broad language of the Twenty-First Amendment is sanctioned by its history; and by the decisions of this Court on the Wilson Act (27 U.S.C.A.  121), the Webb-Kenyon Act ( 27 U.S.C.A.  122) and the Reed Amendment (27 U.S.C.A.  1 note).3 As we think the language of the amendment is \n\n[299 U.S. 59, 64]\n\u00a0\n clear, we do not discuss these matters. The plaintiffs insist that to sustain the exaction of the importer's license fee would involve a declaration that the amendment has, in respect to liquor, freed the states from all restrictions upon the police power to be found in other provisions of the Constitution. The question for decision requires no such generalization.\n Second. The claim that the statutory provisions and the regulations are void under the equal protection clause may be briefly disposed of. A classification recognized by the Twenty-First Amendment cannot be deemed forbidden by the Fourteenth. Moreover, the classification in taxation made by California rests on conditions requiring difference in treatment. Beer sold within the state comes from two sources. The brewer of the domestic article may be required to pay a license fee for the privilege of manufacturing it; and under the California statute is obliged to pay $750 a year. Compare Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563\n, 30 S.Ct. 578. The brewer of the foreign article cannot be so taxed; only the importer can be reached. He is subjected to a license fee of $500. Compare Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730, 732\n, 23 S.Ct. 401.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BURTER concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The lower courts have differed on this question.

Ray, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for defendants State of Colorado et al.\n Mr. Phil D. Swing, of San Diego, Cal., for defendants State of California et al.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case arises upon the petition of the state of Arizona for leave to file in this Court her bill of complaint against the several states named as defendants and upon their returns to the order of this Court, \n296 \nU.S. 552\n, 56 S.Ct. 303, directing them to show cause why the prayer of the petition should not be granted. The returns raise numerous objections to the sufficiency of the proposed bill of complaint, only two of which we find it necessary to consider. One is that the proposed bill fails to present any justiciable case or controversy within the jurisdiction of the Court. The other is that the United States, which is not named as a defendant and has not consented to be sued, is an indispensable party to any decree granting the relief prayed by the bill.\n The relief sought is: (1) That the quantum of Arizona's equitable share of the water flowing in the Colo- \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 560]\n\u00a0\n rado river, subject to diversion and use, be fixed by this Court, and that the petitioner's title thereto be quieted against adverse claims of the defendant states. (2) That the state of California be barred from having or claiming any right to divert and use more than an equitable share of the water flowing in the river, to be determined by the Court, and not to exceed the limitation imposed upon California's use of such water by the Boulder Canyon Project Act, 45 Stat. 1057, (43 U.S.C.A.  617-617t), and the act of the California Legislature of March 4, 1929, c. 16, Stats.Cal. 1929, p. 38. (3) That it be decreed that the diversion and use by any of the defendant states of any part of the equitable share of the water decreed to Arizona pending its diversion and use by her shall not constitute a prior appropriation or confer upon the appropriating state any right in the water superior to that o Arizona. (4) That any right of the republic of Mexico to an equitable share in any increased flow of water in the Colorado river made available by works being constructed by or for California shall be supplied from California's equitable share of the water, and that neither petitioner nor the defendant states other than California shall be required to contribute to it from their equitable shares as adjudicated by the Court.\n The proposed bill this, in substance, seeks a judicial apportionment among the states in the Colorado River Basin of the unappropriated water of the river, with the limitation that the share of California shall not exceed the amount to which she is limited by the Boulder Canyon Project Act and by her statute, and with the proviso that any increase in the flow of water to which the republic of Mexico may be entitled shall be supplied from the amount apportioned to California. Our consideration of the case is restricted to an examination of the facts alleged in the proposed bill of complaint and of those of which we may take judicial notice. \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 561]\n\u00a0\n The Colorado river, a navigable stream, see Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423\n, 51 S.Ct. 522, having a total length of 1,293 miles, rises in Colorado and flows through that state 245 miles, then through Utah 285 miles, then through Arizona 292 miles, then on the boundary between Arizona and Nevada 145 miles, then on the boundary between Arizona and California 235 miles, then on the boundary between Arizona and Mexico 16 miles, and then through the republic of Mexico to the Gulf of California 75 miles. For 688 miles, more than half its length, the river flows in Arizona or upon her boundary.\n Two dams have been built across the Colorado river by the Secretary of the Interior, acting under authority of acts of Congress. One, Boulder Dam, 378 miles below the intersection of the river with the boundary between Arizona and Utah, creates Boulder Reservoir, extending along the bed of the river 115 miles above the dam. The other, Laguna Dam, is located 18 miles above the point where the Colorado river becomes the boundary between Arizona and Mexico. Two other dams are projected and in course of construction under contracts entered into by the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to acts of Congress. Boulder Canyon Project Act  1, 43 U.S.C.A.  617; United States Session Laws 1935, 49 Stat. p. 1039,  2. See United States v. State of Arizona, \n295 \nU.S. 174\n, 55 S.Ct. 666. Both are in that part of the river which flows between Arizona and California. One Parker Dam, is approximately 150 miles south of Boulder Dam, and the other, Imperial Dam, is 4 1\/2 miles above Laguna Dam.\n The average annual undepleted flow of the Colorado river in Arizona, at Imperial Dam, is approximately 16,840,000 acre feet. \n1\n Of the total undepleted flow approxi- \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 562]\n\u00a0\n mately 6,100,000 acre feet per annum have been appropriated and put to beneficial use in the United States and the Mexican Republic. \n2\n After deducting all existing appropriations, there remains in the river subject to future appropriation a net average annual flow of at least 9,720,000 acre feet. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n About 2,027,000 acres of land are under irrigation by water diverted from the Colorado river and its tributaries other than the Gila, of which 72,120 acres are in Arizona. \n4\n There are more than 2,000,000 acres of land in Arizona that are not irrigated, but are susceptible of economic irrigation from the unappropriated water of the Colorado River and its tributaries other than the Gila, and which \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 563]\n\u00a0\n cannot be irrigated from any other source. There are 5,000,000 additional acres of land in Arizona 'potentially susceptible of economic irrigation' from the waters of the river. There are pending projects to irrigate more than 1,000,000 acres of this unirrigated but irrigable land, of which more than 100,000 acres are owned by the state of Arizona. The amount of water required for such irrigation is in excess of 4,000,000 acre feet annually.\n By the Colorado River Compact, see Arizona v. California, supra, entered into by the defendant states and approved by Congress, but to which Arizona is not a party, the undepleted flow of water of the Colorado river is apportioned between the upper basin and the lower basin of the river valley; the point of division being Lees Ferry, 23 miles below the southern boundary of Utah. To each basin there is apportioned 7,500,000 acre feet per annum, and the lower basin has the additional right to increase its 'beneficial consumptive use' of the water by 1,000,000 feet per annum.\n By the Boulder Canyon Project Act, the Secretary of the Interior was authorized, subject to the terms of the Colorado River Compact (St.Cal. 1929, p. 1 et seq.), to construct, operate, and maintain a dam and incidental works at the present site of Boulder Dam, with an appurtenant hydroelectric plant, and to use and dispose of the water stored above the dam for irrigation and for the development of power. The act also provided that no authority should be exercised under it until six of the states in the Colorado River Basin, including California, should ratify the compact, and, unless the state of California, by act of its Legislature, should agree with the United States, for the benefit of all the states in the river basin, that the aggregate annual use of water from the river by the state of California should not exceed 4,400,000 acre feet annually, plus one-half of any excess of surplus waters unapportioned by the compact. The compact was duly ratified by the six \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 564]\n\u00a0\n defendant states, and the limitation upon the use of the water by California was duly enacted into law by the California Legislature by Act of March 4, 1929, supra. By its provisions the use of the water by California is restricted to 5,485,500 acre feet annually. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Secretary of the Interior acting under authority of section 5 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act (43 U.S.C.A.  617d), has entered into contracts with California corporations for the storage in the Boulder Dam reservoir and the delivery, for use in California,6 of 5,362,000 acre feet of water annually, for a stipulated compensation. The proposed bill of complaint charges that, notwithstanding the limitation upon the use of the water by California, certain California corporations, with the aid of the United States, propose to divert from the river and use consumptively in California an aggregate amount of 14,330,000 acre feet annually, including that which the Secretary of the Interior has contracted to deliver, or 8, 444,500 acre feet in excess of the amount which California is permitted to take by the Boulder Canyon Project Act and her own statute, and sufficient to use all but about 1,000,000 acre feet of the unappropriated annual flow of the river. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[298 U.S. 558, 565]\n\u00a0\n Arizona asserts that she is damaged by the impending appropriations of water by California by reason of the fact that future reclamation of land in Arizona can be accomplished only by large scale projects, contemplating the irrigation of large areas to be operated and administered as a single unit, and, because of the great cost of diversion works and large expenditures required to establish such projects, it will be impossible to finance them, 'unless water for the irrigation of said land can be appropriated and unclouded, undisputed and incontestable rights to the permanent use thereof acquired at or prior to the time of constructing such works.'\n It is conceded both by the bill of complaint and the returns that all the states in the Colorado River Basin except California, and California so far as material to the present case, apply the doctrine of appropriation to the waters of flowing streams in their respective territories. Under this doctrine, diversion and application of water to \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 566]\n\u00a0\n a beneficial use constitute an appropriation, and entitle the appropriator to a continuing right to use the water, to the extent of the appropriation, but not beyond that reasonably required and actually used. The appropriator first in time is prior in right over others upon the same stream, and the right, when perfected by use, is deemed effective from the time the purpose to make the appropriation is definitely formed and actual work upon the project is begun, or from the time statutory requirements of notice of the proposed appropriation are complied with, provided the work is carried to completion and the water is applied to a beneficial use with reasonable diligence. See Arizona v. California, supra; State of Kansas v. State of Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46\n, 27 S.Ct. 655; Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419\n, 42 S.Ct. 552.\n Arizona, by her proposed bill of complaint, asserts no right arising from her own appropriation of the waters of the Colorado river. No infringement of her rights acquired by appropriation is alleged, and no relief for their protection is prayed. While it is alleged that definite plans have been made for the irrigation of 1,000,000 acres of unirrigated land in Arizona, and a right to share in the water for that purpose is asserted, it does not appear that any initial step toward appropriation of water for such a project has been taken.\n The right of the California corporations to withdraw from the river a total of 5,362,000 acre feet annually under the contracts with the Secretary of the Interior is challenged only in so far as the prayer for relief asks that the unappropriated water of the river be equitably apportioned among Arizona and the defendant states, and that any increased amount to which the republic of Mexico may be entitled be directed to be supplied from the amount to which California may otherwise be found to be equitably entitled. \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 567]\n\u00a0\n Arizona does not assert any right to the benefit of the undertaking of California, in conformity to the Boulder Canyon Project Act, to restrict its own use of the water. The brief for Arizona disclaims the assertion of any rights under 'the Boulder Canyon Project Act, the Colorado River Compact, or the Boulder Project itself.'\n The allegations and prayer of the bill are of significance only if Arizona, in advance of any act of appropriation, and independently of any rights which she may have acquired under the Boulder Canyon Project Act, may demand a judicial decree exempting the available water of the river, or some of it, from appropriation by other states until the indefinite time in the future when she or her inhabitants may see fit to appropriate it. A justiciable controversy is presented only if Arizona, as a sovereign state, or her citizens, whom she represents, have present rights in the unappropriated water of the river, or if the privilege to appropriate the water is capable of division and when partitioned may be judicially protected from appropriations by others pending its exercise.\n The defendant states deny that there is any such right or privilege upon which this Court can act judicially in advance of appropriation. While California, by statement of her Attorney General in brief and argument, disclaims any purpose to take more than the water to which she is restricted by the Boulder Canyon Project Act and by her own statute, she, and the other defendant states, nevertheless maintain that the authority of this Court is limited to the application of the local law of appropriation in adjudicating their rights. They deny that Arizona and her inhabitants have or can assert any right in the water before its appropriation, and challenge the jurisdiction of the Court to make any division of the unexercised privilege among the states entitled to share in the unappropriated water. Pursued to its logical end, their con- \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 568]\n\u00a0\n tention is that California, save as she may have renounced the privilege, is free, subject to prior appropriations, to appropriate to her own use the entire flow of the water in the river, to the exclusion of any future beneficial enjoyment of it by Arizona.\n Arizona insists that this court, in adjudicating the rights of states in the water of interstate streams, has declared that it will not hold itself restricted to rigid application of loc l rules of law governing private rights; that independently of those rules it may have recourse to applicable principles of international law and equity tending to secure to sovereign states equality of right in such water.

It points out that departure from the local formula may be compelled where the contending states apply, locally, different and irreconcilable doctrines, State of Kansas v. Colorado, supra, and that the common-law of private riparian rights has been modified, even in suits between states adhering to it, by the application of principles of equitable apportionment.

New York, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 336, 343\n, 51 S.Ct. 478. But we have no occasion to consider the arguments urged upon us in support of the adoption, in this case, of a different rule from that of appropriation, as applied locally, for we are of the opinion that in the circumstances disclosed by the bill of complaint there can be no adjudication of rights in the unappropriated water of the Colorado river without the presence, as a party, of the United States, which, without its consent, is not subject to suit even by a state. State of Kansas v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 331, 343\n, 27 S.Ct. 388. \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 569]\n\u00a0\n The Colorado river is a navigable stream of the United States. The privilege of the states through which it flows and their inhabitants to appropriate and use the water is subject to the paramount power of the United States to control it for the purpose of improving navigation. Arizona v. California, supra. The Boulder Canyon Project Act,  1 (43 U.S. C.A.  617), authorized the Secretary of the Interior to construct, at the expense of the United States, the Boulder Dam, with storage reservoir, and a hydroelectric plant. It provides, sections 5, 6 (43 U.S.C.A.  617d, 617e), for control, management, and appropriation of the water by the United States, and declares, sections 1, 8(a) (43 U.S.C.A.  617, 617g(a), that this authority is conferred subject to the terms of the Colorado River Compact 'for the purpose of controlling the floods, improving navigation and regulating the flow of the Colorado River, providing for storage and for the delivery of the stored waters thereof for reclamation of public lands and other beneficial uses exclusively within the United States, and for the generation of electrical energy as a means of making the project herein authorized a self-supporting and financially solvent undertaking.'\n To carry out the purpose of the act, section 1 directs the creation of a storage reservoir of a capacity of not less than 20,000,000 acre feet. According to the allegations of the proposed bill, the actual capacity of the completed reservoir is 30,500,000 acre feet, which is nearly twice the undepleted annual flow of the river, and four and one-half times the amount of water remaining unappropriated after deducting that which California is to receive under the contracts with the Secretary of the Interior.\n By section 6 of the act (43 U.S.C.A.  617e) the dam and reservoir are directed to be used, 'first, for river regulation, improvement of navigation, and flood control; second, for irrigation and domestic uses and satisfaction of present perfected rights; ... and third, for power.' Section 5 (43 U.S.C.A.  617d) pro- \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 570]\n\u00a0\n vides that 'no person shall have or be entitled to have the use for any purpose of the water stored as aforesaid except by contract made as herein stated.' Section 5 also provides that the Secretary of the Interior may contract for the storage of water and for delivery thereof upon charges which will provide revenue, and section 5(c), 43 U.S.C.A.  617d(c), directs that 'contracts for the use of water ... shall be made with responsible applicants therefor who will pay the price fixed by the said Secretary with a view to meeting the revenue requirements herein provided for.' Acting under this authority, the Secretary of the Interior has substantially completed the project and has entered into contracts, so the bill of complaint alleges, for the delivery of 5,362,000 acre feet of stored water to California corporations, and for the financing and construction of Parker and Imperial Dams and the All American Canal to facilitate the use of this water in California.\n Without more detailed statement of the facts disclosed, it is evident that the United States, by congressional legislation and by acts of its officers which that legislation authorizes, has undertaken in the asserted exercise of its authority to control navigation, to impound, and control the disposition of, the surplus water in the river not already appropriated. The defendant states contend, and Arizona does not deny, that the natural dependable flow of the river is already overappropriated, and it does not appear that without the storage of the impounded water any substantial amount of water would be available for appropriation.\n The decree sought has no relation to any present use of the water thus impounded which infringes rights which Arizona may assert subject to superior but unexercised powers of the United States. Cf. Wisconsin v. Illinois, \n278 \nU.S. 367\n, 49 S.Ct. 163. See Arizona v. California, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 464\n, 51 S.Ct. 522; United States v. Arizona, supra, \n295 \nU.S. 174, 183\n, 55 S.Ct. 666. The prayer is for a decree of equitable division of the privilege of future \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 571]\n\u00a0\n appropriation. The relief asked, and that which upon the facts alleged would alone be of benefit to Arizona, is a decree adjudicating to petitioners the 'unclouded ... rights to the permanent use of' the water. Such a decree could not be framed without the adjudication of the superior rights asserted by the United States. The 'equitable share' of Arizona in the unappropriated water impounded above Boulder Dam could not be determined without ascertaining the rights of the United States to dispose of that water in aid and support of its project to control navigation, and without challenging the dispositions already agreed to by the Secretary's contracts with the California corporations, and the provision as well of section 5 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act that no person shall be entitled to the stored water except by contract with the Secretary.\n It is argued that the constitutional power of the United States to exert any control over the water stored at Boulder Dam is subject to the rights of Arizona to an equitable share in the unappropriated water 'until such a time as commerce is actually moving on the river,' and that in any case Congress has subordinated that power to Arizona's rights by the provisions of section 4(a) of the Boulder Canyon Project Act (43 U.S.C.A.  617c(a), which authorizes Arizona, California, and Nevada to enter into an agreement as to their relative rights in the water or the river. But these and similar contentions, so far as they were not answered adversely to Arizona in Arizona v. California, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 456\n, 51 S.Ct. 522, cannot be judicially determined in a proceeding to which the United States is not a party and in which it cannot be heard.\n Every right which Arizona asserts is so subordinate to and dependent upon the rights and the exercise of an authority asserted by the United States that no final determination of the one can be made without a determination of the extent of the o her. Although no decree \n\n[298 U.S. 558, 572]\n\u00a0\n rendered in its absence can bind or affect the United States, that fact is not an inducement for this Court to decide the rights of the states which are before it by a decree which, because of the absence of the United States, could have no finality. People of State of California v. Southern Pacific Co., \n157 \nU.S. 229, 251\n, 257 S., 15 S.Ct. 591; State of Minnesota v.

McAdoo, \n234 \nU.S. 627\n, 34 S.Ct. 938\n\n\n The petition to file the proposed bill of complaint is denied. We leave undecided the question whether an equitable division of the unappropriated water of the river can be decreed in a suit in which the United States and the interested states are parties. Arizona will be free to assert such rights as she may have acquired, whether under the Boulder Canyon Project Act and California's undertaking to restrict her own use of the water or otherwise, and to challenge, in any appropriate judicial proceeding, any act of the Secretary of the Interior or others, either states or individuals, injurious to it and in excess of their lawful authority.\n Petition denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 299 U.S. --, 57 S.Ct. 4, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] At Lees Ferry, twenty-three miles below the point where the river enters Arizona from Utah, the average undepleted annual flow is 16,660,000 acre feet. At Boulder Dam it is 17,720,000 acre feet. At the Imperial Dam it is 16,840,000. Nondiversion river losses and evaporation below Lees Ferry aggregate 1,400,000 acre feet annually and are about offset by the river's gains between Lees Ferry and Boulder Dam. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Of this amount approximately 2,500,000 acre feet are diverted annually above Lees Ferry, and are used and consumed in Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, and 3,600,000 acre feet are diverted annually below Lees Ferry from the river and its tributaries other than the Gila. The average annual diversions taking place below the southern boundary of Utah, stated in acre feet, are as follows: Arizona, 585,000; California, ,475, 000; Nevada, 40,000; Mexican Republic, 500,000. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] At Lees Ferry 10,500,000 acre feet; at Boulder Dam 11,100,000 acre feet; at Imperial Dam 9,720,000 acre feet. Allowing for estimated increase in use of the water now appropriated for irrigation of land above Boulder Dam and for diversions by projects now under construction in Colorado, it is estimated that the flow of the Colorado river into and out of the Boulder Dam will, in 1938, average 15,069,000 acre feet per year. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The acreage under irrigation by water diverted from the Colorado river and its tributaries, other than the Gila, is distributed among the Colorado River Basin states as follows: Arizona, 72,120; California, 464, 653; Colorado, 856,413; New Mexico, 45,937; Nevada, 12,308; Utah, 347,452; Wyoming, 228,699. Approximately 525,000 acres of land in the Gila River Basin are irrigated from the waters of that river and its tributaries, of which 520,000 acres are located in Arizona. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The surplus water of the river in the lower basin, unapportioned by the compact, is 2,171,000 acre feet, one-half of which, or 1,085,500 acre feet, California is entitled, under the Boulder Canyon Project Act, and her own statute, to add to the 4,400,000 acre feet which they specifically allot to her, making a total allotment of 5,485,500 acre feet annually. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] \n Metropolitan Water District 1,100,000 acre feet Imperial Valley and others 3,850,000 acre feet City of San Diego 112,000 acre feet Palo Verdi 300,000 acre feet ___ Total 5,362,000 acre feet\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] By way of specification of this general statement it is alleged that such corporations have made application to the division of water resources, department of public works of the state of California, \n\n for permits to divert and appropriate annually from the river quantities of water aggregating more than 12,670,000 acre feet, and that the state of California will grant the permits so applied for, upon completion by such corporations of the necessary diversion works. In addition, it is alleged that the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to section 1 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, has entered into a contract with the Imperial Irrigation District, a California corporation, in connection with the building of the Imperial Dam for the construction of a main canal known as the 'All American Canal,' to connect the dam with the Imperial and Coachella Valleys, which provides for the delivery to the United States, at the Imperial Dam, of 1,460,000 acre feet per year, to be used for irrigation and power. Approximately 200,000 acre feet of this amount will be used for the irrigation of lands in the United States Yuma Reclamation Project in Arizona. The remainder will be used for irrigation of the Yuma Indian Reservation in California and for power. An additional 400,000 acre feet will be used for desilting the canal. The water to be used for desilting and power will be returned to the river at a point where it cannot be recaptured for further use in the United States. \n\n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MISSOURI v. ROSS(1936)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 9, 1936\n\n\n\n Submitted Oct. 12, 1936.\n Messrs.\nRoy McKittrick, Atty. Gen., and Harry G. Waltner, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen. ( Mr. Gilbert Lamb, of Jefferson City, Mo., of counsel), for the State of Missouri.\n Mr. Edgar H. Wayman, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents. \n\n[299 U.S. 72, 73]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent Ross is a trustee in bankruptcy. The estate of the bankrupt was indebted to the state of Missouri for taxes in the sum of $8, 366.38, with interest, and to the city of St. Louis for taxes in the sum of $8,972.30 and interest. The funds of the estate were insufficient to pay these taxes in full. The referee held that the claims of the state and city were of equal rank under section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended ( 11 U.S.C.A.  104), and that the available funds should be prorated between the claims according to their respective amounts. He therefore denied the motion of the state for priority.\n The order of the referee was approved and confirmed by the District Court; and, upon appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the order of the District Court was affirmed. 80 F.(2d) 329.\n The referee and both courts proceeded upon the theory that by section 64b, par. (6), of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  104(b)(6), all taxes, whether of the United States, state, county, district, or municipality, were placed on a parity. We agree with that view.\n Section 64a, as amended (11 U.S.C.A.  104(a), requires the payment of all taxes 'legally due and owing by the bankrupt to the United States, State, county, district, or municipality, in the order of priority as set forth in paragraph (b) hereof.' Paragraph (b) prescribes the order of priority in which debts shall be paid in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors, the sixth order being 'taxes payable under paragraph (a) hereof,' and the seventh order being 'debts owing to any person who by the laws of the States or the United States is entitled to priority.' The text of paragraph (b) in full appears in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[299 U.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n First. By this enumeration it is clear that Congress intended to establish seven distinct classes of indebtedness and establish their priority in respect of one another in the order set forth. When it came to the sixth paragraph, it embodied taxes payable under paragraph (a), there enumerated as taxes due the United States, state, county, district, or municipality. The intention clearly was to put these various governmental units in respect of their taxes in a single class upon terms of equality with one another. Since Congress was at pains to set forth the order of priority in distinct paragraphs under separate numerals, we \n\n[299 U.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n are unable to reach any other conclusion. If it had been intended to establish priorities as among the governmental units named in the order in which they appear in the sixth paragraph, the very structure of section 64b plainly suggests that each would have appeared under a separate numeral instead of all being grouped under a single numeral.\n In New Jersey v. Anderson, \n203 \nU.S. 483, 489\n, 27 S.Ct. 137, 139, this court specifically said: 'The requirement of the present law is a wide departure from the act of 1867, and specifically obliges the trustee to pay all taxes legally due and owing, without distinction between the United States and the State, county, district, or municipality.' It is true that this statement was not necessary to the decision; but it nevertheless correctly states our view as to the meaning of the clause under consideration, and is now definitely approved. The decision in that case was made nearly 30 years ago, since which time the lower federal courts have almost unanimously followed the rule there stated. We deem it unnecessary to review the decisions, since that has been carefully done by the referee in his certificate, and by the court in its opinion. Among the cases are the following: In re A. E. Fountain, Inc. (D.C.) 295 F. 873, 874; In re Wyley Co. (D.C.) 292 F. 900, 902; In re A. J. Waterman Mfg. Co. (D.C .) 291 F. 589, 594. These decisions are plainly correct; but, if they were doubtful, we should at this late day hesitate to disturb them. United States v. Ryan, \n284 \nU.S. 167, 174\n, 52 S.Ct. 65, 67. Moreover, Congress in the face of these decisions has permitted the clause as it now appears in paragraph (b)(6) to stand for many years without change in its phraseology, although amending that portion of the Bankruptcy Act in other particulars. This is persuasive evidence of the adoption by that body of the judicial construction. United States v. Ryan, supra, \n284 U.S. 167\n, at page 175, 52 S.Ct 65; Sessions v. Romadka, \n145 \nU.S. 29, 41\n, 42 S., 12 S.Ct. 799. \n\n[299 U.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n Second. The state urges that the question is controlled by paragraph ( b)(7), which gives priority in the seventh degree to 'debts owing to any person who by the laws of the States ... is entitled to priority.' Section 3152, Rev.Stat. Missouri 1929 (Mo.St.Ann.  3152, p. 4969), provides that, in cases of insolvency, debts due the state shall be first satisfied, and that this priority shall extend to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed. The contention is that unpaid taxes constitute debts, and therefore fall within the seventh paragraph. But this conclusion must be rejected; for, conceding that taxes are debts, they are carved out of the general provisions of paragraph (b) (7) and put in a special class under paragraph (b)(6), and thus fall within the rule that special provisions prevail over general ones which, in the absence of the special provisions, would control.

The challenged tax is paid into the state treasury and used to defray the expenses of administering the State Oil and Gas Proration Law (Laws Okl. 1933, c. 131). The Oklahoma Supreme Court held that the tax is not within the congressional consent, and accordingly enjoined its collection as imposing an unconstitutional burden on the Indian leases, which are deemed to be instrumentalities of the federal government. Barnsdall Refineries, Inc., v. Oklahoma Tax Commission, 171 Okl. 145, 41 P.(2d) 918. We granted certiorari, \n296 \nU.S. 556\n, 56 S.Ct. 97, to review the judgment of the state court; the case being of public importance because involving relations of the state to the national government.\n The Oklahoma Legislature, by Act of February 14, 1916, c. 39, Okl. Session Laws, p. 102, imposed a production tax of 3 per cent. of the gross value of all oil produced within the state. The act provides that the tax shall be in lieu of all other taxes upon oil in place in the ground, oil leases, or equipment used for oil production, and that one-third of the tax collected in each county shall be returned to it for the construction of permanent roads and bridges and 'for and in aid of' the common schools. The levy is denominated by the taxing act a 'gross production tax,' a label which this Court and the Supreme Court of Oklahoma have accepted as appropriate. Gillespie v.

Other sections of the act permitted the extension, by an additional 25 years, of the period, expiring in 1931, for which mineral leases of the lands of the Osage Indians might be granted by the Secretary of the Interior acting in their behalf.\n Congress, in enacting the legislation, was advised of the Oklahoma 3 per cent. gross production tax, of the decisions of this Court holding lessees of Indian oil lands, which \n\n[296 U.S. 521, 524]\n\u00a0\n were located in Osage county, immune from the tax, and that removal of the immunity would benefit the Osage Indians through the return of one-third of the tax to the county. See Hearings before Committee on Indian Affairs, S. 4039 (particularly letters of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Indian Commissioner to the Chairman of the Committee), part 1, pp. 7, 8; part 2, pp. 108, 109; Report Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, No. 704, 66th Cong., 3rd Sess. As originally introduced, the bill authorized the levy of a gross production tax upon oil produced in Osage county 'not to exceed 3 per centum of the value of the same,' and directed that it should be 'distributed as now provided by the laws of Oklahoma.' With the evident purpose of removing the 3 per cent. limit but not of otherwise altering the character of the permitted tax, the 3 per cent. limitation was stricken from the bill before enactment.\n Congress, in removing the tax immunity, chus had in contemplation the particular tax then on the statute books of Oklahoma, then and ever since described as a gross production tax, the benefits of which would inure to Indians in Osage county by the distribution of a part of the tax to that county. The section bears its own evidence of the intention that the waiver of tax immunity of the production of oil from Indian lands was to be limited to a tax having these characteristics. The tax is described as a gross production tax. It is to be 'paid and distributed, and in lieu of all other state and county taxes levied upon the production of oil and gas as provided by the laws of Oklahoma. ...' The reference must be taken to be to the laws then in effect, unless we are to indulge the improbable assumption that the state was to be left free to dispense with the requirement that the tax permitted was to be in lieu of all other taxes. This conclusion seems inescapable, despite the amendment of the bill as introduced by dropping the word 'now' from the \n\n[296 U.S. 521, 525]\n\u00a0\n direction that the tax is to be 'distributed as now provided by the laws of Oklahoma,' since in the section as amended the phrase is used to qualify the 'lieu' provision of the statute as well as the payment and distribution provisions. The section removing the immunity thus described the gross production tax then on the statute books, which was by the taxing act declared to be in lieu of all other taxes upon the oil leases, with which Congress was particularly concerned. Moreover, the Secretary is directed to pay from Indian funds 'the per centum' levied as a gross production tax 'to be distributed as provided by the laws of Oklahoma' and to pay to the county for road and bridge construction 'an additional sum' equal to 1 per cent. of the oil royalties received upon the Osage Indian leases; the latter sum evidently being in addition to the amounts to be received by the county upon distribution of the gross production tax.\n We think that the cumulative effect of the words of the section, obscure until read in the light of its history and of the situation to which it applied, is persuasive that the permitted tax is, as was the then existing tax, one to be measured by the gross value of the oil produced, and to be distributed in part to the counties and thus to be of benefit to the Indian owners of lands in Osage county.\n In these particulars the tax of one-eighth of a cent per barrel of oil produced does not conform to the congressional consent. The taxing act does not, as required by the permissive act, levy a per centum gross production tax in terms of value, and, more important, it provides that the entire tax levied for the period from the effective date of the Act of 1933 to June 30, 1935, is to be used to pay the expenses of state officials authorized by the state 'proration law' to apportion and control oil and gas production in such manner as to prevent waste by producers drawing from a common source or pool. No part of the proceeds of the tax is required to be paid to the counties, \n\n[296 U.S. 521, 526]\n\u00a0\n and the benefits of proration depending upon the existence of a common source drawn upon by different producers, would not necessarily extend to any particular county.\n The Supreme Court of Oklahoma emphasized the fact that the one-eighth of a cent per barrel tax, denominated by the statute an 'excise,' is an excise tax distinguishable from a property tax in lieu of which the gross production tax is levied, and different from the gross production tax in its temporary character and the method of its computation and distribution, and so concluded that it is not a tax contemplated by the congressional consent. Construing that consent with the strictness appropriate to the interpretation of a waiver of a defined tax immunity of the sovereign, we think the conclusion of the state court was right.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 5.

STATE OF OREGON(1936)\nNo. 11\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 517, 518]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George G. Hannan and John H. Dunbar, both of Olympia, Wash., and John C. Hurspool, of Walla Walla, Wash., for the State of Washington.\n Messrs. Charles Z. Randall, of Pendleton, Or., George T. Cochran, of La Grande, Or., and I. H. Van Winkle, of Salem, Or., for the State of Oregon.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n With leave of court (\n283 \nU.S. 801\n, 51 S.Ct. 559), the state of Washington filed a bill of complaint on July 22, 1931, in which it charged that the state of Oregon as wrongfully diverting the waters of the Walla Walla river to the prejudice of inhabitants of Washington, and prayed an adjudication apportioning the interests of the two states in the river and in tributary streams and restraining any \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n use or diversion of the waters found to be unlawful. To this complaint Oregon filed an answer containing denials and defenses, to which Washington replied. On February 20, 1933, this court appointed a special master with authority to take evidence and with directions to make findings of fact and conclusions of law to be submitted to the court with recommendations for a decree. \n288 \nU.S. 592\n, 53 S.Ct. 399. The case is now here upon exceptions filed by Washington to the master's report, which finds the facts fully and advises the dismissal of the bill.\n The Walla Walla river, a nonnavigable stream, rises in the Blue Mountains of Northeastern Oregon. For about four miles above the city of Milton it flows through a narrow canyon; the waters for that reach being inaccessible for purposes of irrigation. At Milton the river broadens out in a delta formation. The first division in this formation is at Red Bridge, near the city, where the river breaks into two branches. One, the Tum-a-lum, as it is known in Oregon, or the main Walla Walla, as it is known in Washington, flows through cobble rocks over great depths of gravel till it reaches the McCoy Bridge. There, at the margin of an alluvial fan, springs rise from below the surface, and feed the flow anew. Thus reinforced, the stream moves northwesterly to the line between the two states, and again northwesterly for about 30 miles in Washington to its confluence with the Columbia river. A second branch of the river, starting at the Red Bridge, is known as the Little Walla Walla, which divides after a mile into the Crocket and the Ford. Prongs of the Crocket which contribute little, if any, water during the irrigation season, combine with another stream after crossing the state line, and discharge into the main river above the intake of the canal of the Gardena project. Another prong of the Crocket comes together with the Ford and joins the main river in Washington below the intake of the canal. Still another tribu- \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n tary, known as the Mill creek, rises in the Blue Mountains and flows far to the east of the courses just described. After breaking up into other creeks (the Yellowhawk, the Garrison, and others), it joins the main stream of the Walla Walla within the state of Washington. No claim is made by the complainant that the waters of Mill creek have been illegally diverted. Indeed, the fact appears to be that the inhabitants of Washington use the waters of that creek to the exclusion of any use thereof by the inhabitants of Oregon. The claim of wrongdoing has its center in the use of the waters of the Walla Walla arising above the Red Bridge.\n The Walla Walla Basin has a emiarid climate with warm dry summers and cold wet winters. The streams contributing to the river are supplied in the main from the snows of the Blue Mountains. Upon the coming of spring, these snows are melted, and the river at that season attains its highest flow. Even then there are variations, not only from month to month, but from day to day. With the advance of summer, the flow diminishes greatly, particularly in the latter part of July and August. In such a climate agriculture cannot go on successfully without the aid of irrigation. A sporadic supply of water will not meet the farmer's needs. 'To be available in a practical sense, the supply must be fairly continuous and dependable.' Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 471\n, 42 S. Ct. 552, 560. A fair division of the water is thus vital to the prosperity of this agriculatural community, and even to its life, for agricultural in the main it is. True, there are cities also within the limits of the watershed, Walla Walla in Washington, with a population of 15,976; Milton and Freewater in Oregon, with a combined population of 2, 308. Even so, the welfare of the cities is closely bound up with that of the area about them. Indeed, there has been a unity of growth in the development of the whole community, a development quite inde- \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n pendent of the dividing line between the states. As already pointed out, farmers in Washington have had the benefit of Mill creek, which takes its rise in Oregon.\n Complainant and defendant have stipulated that for the purposes of this case the individual rights of the respective landowners and water owners concerned in both states are governed by the doctrine of prior appropriation. Wyoming v. Colorado, supra. The Washington court made a decree in September, 1928, adjudging the priorities of appropriators in Washington. The Oregon court made one in August, 1912, adjudging the priorities of appropriators in Oregon. Neither state was a party to the judicial proceedings in the other. The stream supply has been sufficient through the aid of the Mill creek to satisfy rights with priorities up to 1891 under each of the decrees. What Washington complains of cheifly is the deficiency in the supply available for the satisfaction of alleged priorities up to 1892. Particularly it complains of the deficiency of the supply for the Gardena Farms district. By the decree of September, 1928, the district was adjudged the holder of a water right with an 1892 priority for the irrigation of 7,000 acres upon specified conditions. This priority, though recognized in Washington, is contested by Oregon. The project affected by that award was started in 1892 by the Walla Walla Irrigation Company. A canal to connect with the Walla Walla river was to carry water for irrigation to a tract known as the Gardena district, twelve miles or more away. Work on the canal was slow and intermittent, chiefly for lack of funds. About 1903 the engineers discovered that the best land in the District could not be irrigated at all unless the plans were greatly changed. Thereupon a new system of construction was adopted following a different route. Not till 1904 or later was water in the canal applied beneficially to any acreage in Washington except in trifling quantities. Long \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 522]\n\u00a0\n before that time, beginning in 1880 or earlier and continuously thereafter, irrigators in Oregon had been appropriating to themselves the waters of the river above the Red Bridge.\n We turn at this point to a consideration of the acts of appropriation, their nature and effect, in an endeavor to ascertain whether they were legitimate or wrongful. For more than fifty years before the filing of this suit irrigators in Oregon at seasons of shortage maintained crude or temporary dams across the Walla Walla river close to the Red Bridge. During the low-water periiod the effect of the dam was to turn the waters of the river away from the channel of the Tum-a-lum into the channel of the Little Walla Walla, where they were used for agricultur l, domestic, and kindred purposes. A small quantity of water necessary to supply the right of the East Side ditch has been permitted to go by the dam without interference. With that exception, which is negligible, all the waters have been diverted without interruption and without protest for more than fifty years. Was this a wrong to Washington?\n'Before this court can be moved to exercise its extraordinary power under the Constitution to control the conduct of one state at the suit of another, the threatened invasion of rights must be of serious magnitude and it must be established by clear and convincing evidence.' New York v. New Jersey, \n256 \nU.S. 296, 309\n, 41 S.Ct. 492, 496; North Dakota v. Minnesota, \n263 \nU.S. 365, 374\n, 44 S.Ct. 138; Connecticut v. Massachusetts, \n282 \nU.S. 660, 669\n, 51 S.Ct. 286, 289; Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 521\n, 26 S.Ct. 268. The master has found: 'There is no satisfactory proof that to tuen down water past the Red Bridge in Oregon during the period of water shortage would be materially more advantageous to Washington users than to permit such water to be applied to surface irrigation in Oregon.' This is so because of the nature of the channel of the Tum-a-lum river. During the pe- \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 523]\n\u00a0\n riod of water shortage, only a small quantity of water would go by if the dams should be removed. There is evidence that this quantity, small at the beginning, would be quickly absorbed and lost in the deep gravel beneath the channel. Experiments have proved that it would not reach the McCoy Bridge, only a few miles down the stream. As to this the master finds: 'The channel of the Tum-a-lum river between the Nursery Bridge (which is close to the Red Bridge) and the McCoy Bridge (farther down) is an extremely wasteful channel. Water turned past the Red Bridge sinks and becomes part of the underground waters.' 'To limit the longestablished use in Oregon would materially injure Oregon users without a compensating benefit to Washington users.' These findings are well supported by the evidence. Complainant has brought forward no adequate reason for disturbing them. Connecticut v. Massachusetts, supra, \n282 U.S. 660\n, at page 669, 51 S.Ct. 286. Accepting them, as we do, we accept also the conclusion to which they point with inescapable directness. To restrain the diversion at the bridge would bring distress and even ruin to a long-established settlement of tillers of the soil for no other or better purpose than to vindicate a barren right. This is not the high equity that moves the conscience of the court in giving judgment between states. North Dakota v. Minnesota, supra; Connecticut v. Massachusetts, supra; Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 109\n, 27 S.Ct. 655. Far from being that, it is rather 'the summum jus of power.' Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Johnson, \n293 \nU.S. 335, 339\n, 55 S.Ct. 154, 156. In default of reasons for removal more urgent and compelling, the tillers of the soil will be left where they have settled. Cf. Hough v. Porter, 51 Or. 318, 415, 95 P. 732, 98 P. 1083, 102 P. 728; Matheson v. Ward, 24 Wash. 407, 411, 64 P. 520, 85 Am.St.Rep. 955.\n\n The question must still be met whether the waters when diverted are misapplied or wasted with ensuing loss \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 524]\n\u00a0\n to the complainant. As to this the findings are explicit, and they are supported by the evidence. 'The use of water by the irrigators within the State of Oregon is not unduly wasteful but is, under the circumstances, a reasonable, beneficial and necessary use.' Nor does the evidence sustain the allegation of the bill that through the diversion of the stream and the application of the water to new irrigated lands the underground water supply has been so shifted to the west that it does not return to the river at such a point as to be usable by the inhabitants of Washington. As to this and other charges of damage or wrongdoing, the burden of proof falls heavily on complainant, more heavily, we have held, than in a suit for an injunction where states are not involved. North Dakota v. Minnesota, supra; Connecticut v. Massachusetts, supra. The burden has not been borne. On the contrary, the maser finds on the basis of supporting evidence that 'a substantial part of the water applied to irrigation in Oregon ... goes into the underground water supply,' and returns to the river. Indeed, he goes farther and concludes that 'the use of water for irrigation within the State of Oregon is beneficial to irrigators within the State of Washington,' by feeding the many springs that supply the main river later in its course. Whether this is so or not, certain at least it is that the injury, if there is any, does not appear 'by clear and convincing evidence' to be one 'of serious magnitude.' Connecticut v. Massachusetts, supra; New York v. New Jersey, supra. Between the high contending parties whose interests are involved, nothing less will set in motion the restraining power of the court.\n Next to be considered is the practice of the defendant's farmers in sinking wells upon their farms. This is stated in the findings. 'In addition to the surface water available for use within the State of Oregon, the farmers have tapped the subsurface water supply by sinking about \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 525]\n\u00a0\n three hundred wells, from which wells they pump each year approximately 9, 000 acre feet of water. The water so pumped is used upon the lands where the several wells are located.' A different question would be here if the water when extracted had been sold or otherwise employed for use on distant lands. Such use is unlawful according to the rule in many courts ( Snake Creek Mining & Tunnel Co. v. Midway Irrigation Co., \n260 \nU.S. 596\n, 43 S.Ct. 215, affirming (C.C.A.) 271 F. 157; Forbell v. City of New York, 164 N.Y. 522, 58 N.E. 644, 51 L.R.A. 695, 79 Am.St.Rep. 666; People v. New York Carbonic Acid Gas Co., 196 N.Y. 421, 90 N.E. 441; Bassett v. Salisbury Mfg. Co., 43 N.H. 569, 82 Am.Dec. 179; Patrick v. Smith, 75 Wash. 407, 134 P. 1076, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 740), though the decisions are not uniform (Acton v. Blundell, 12 Mees&W. 324).1 Again, a different question would be here if the waters, though subterranean, followed a defined channel, instead of percolating vagrantly through rocks and sand and gravel. Snake Creek Mining & Tunnel Co. v. Midway Irrigation Co., supra; Boyce v. Cupper, 37 Or. 256, 260, 61 P. 642; Hayes v. Adams, 109 Or. 51, 57, 58, 218 P. 933; Meyer v. Tacoma Light & Water Co., 8 Wash. 144, 35 P. 601; Horne v. Utah Oil Refining Co., 59 Utah, 279, 202 P. 815, 31 A.L.R. 883; Clinchfield Coal Corporation v. Compton, 148 Va. 437, 139 S. E. 308, 55 A.L.R. 1376. Here the water level is on such a slope that, without any pumping, gravity would take the water away from the channel of any stream, either above the surface or below it. In such circumstances the right to pump in reasonable quantities for the beneficial enjoyment of the overlying land is allowed even by those courts that have placed the narrowest restrictions on the use of percolating waters. Maricopa County District v. Southwest Cotton Co., 39 Ariz. 65, 86, 90, 97, 100, 4 P.(2d) 369; City of Los Angeles v. Pomeroy, 124 Cal. 597, 57 P. 585; McClintock v. Hudson, 141 Cal. 275, 74 P. \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 526]\n\u00a0\n 849; City of Los Angeles v. Hunter, 156 Cal. 603, 105 P. 755.2 Cf. Ide v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 497, 506\n, 44 S.Ct. 182. In saying this we do not intimate, either one way or the other, that our conclusion would be different if the geological formation were other than it is. To all this we add that once more, as at other stages of the case, complainant has been unsuccessful in supplying evidence of damage. As to that the master finds: 'There is no satisfactory proof that the use of the water from these wells materially lessens the quantity of water available for use within the State of Washington.' If any wrong has been done, it is unsubstantial and uncertain.\n What has been said avails without more to repel the claim of the complainant that by the dams at the Red Bridge or by the use of wells or pumps the Oregon irrigators are wrongfully diverting or depleting the waters of the river to the prejudice of irrigators resident in Washington. To repel this claim of wrong, however, does not dispose of the whole case. The question remains whether the Oregon irrigators as a result of all their acts are taking to themselves more than their euqitable proportion of the waters of the river; priority of appropriation being the basis of division. As to this, too, the master has reported in their favor. For the understanding of his ruling and its satisfactory appraisal there is need to recur briefly to the claim of the Gardena Farms.\n Washington does not challenge the priorities adjudged in the Oregon decree. Oregon does not challenge those adjudged in the Washington decree, except only the priority alloted to the Gardena Farms. If that priority is excluded, the Oregon irrigators have not exceeded their equitable quota, at all events in any measure so substan- \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 527]\n\u00a0\n tial as to call for an injunction in a contest between states. A notice posted in 1892 fixed the locus of the intake of the canal for the Gardena project. This intake was far above the point where the branches of the Little Walla Walla unite with the main stream, if we except a few prongs of insignificant extent. The projectors of the canal were thus informed from the beginning that none of the waters of the Tum-a-lum above the Red Bridge would be available for the canal during the season of summer irrigation as long as the Oregon farmers were permitted to maintain the dams that diverted the waters of the Tum-a-lum into the Little Walla Walla. The physical conditions were notorious and were known to the canal company and, in particular, to its president, the leader of the enterprise. What was done or omitted in keeping the appropriation alive against the Oregon farmers in the vicinity of Milton must be read and interpreted in the light of that knowledge and its resulting obligations.\n A priority once acquired or put in course of acquisition by the posting of a notice may be lost to the claimant by abandonment or laches. There must be no waste in arid lands of the 'treasure' of a river. New Jersey v. New York, \n283 \nU.S. 336, 342\n, 51 S.Ct. 478. The essence of the doctrine of prior appropriation is beneficial use, not a stale or barren claim. Only diligence and good faith will keep the privilege alive. Seaweard v. Pacific Livestock Co., 49 Or. 157, 161, 88 P. 963; In re Water Rights of Silvies River, 115 Or. 27, 61, 237 P. 322; In re Water Rights of Hood River, 114 Or. 112, 131, 227 P. 1065; State ex rel. Ham v. Superior Court, 70 Wash. 442, 463, 126 P. 945.3 When these are shown to be lacking, the water right will fail, or fail to the extent that equity re- \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 528]\n\u00a0\n quires. Such, according to the master, has been the fate of the Gardena filing. True, a court in Washington determine in 1928 that the priority was to be recognized as of 1892. The decree was of no force against Oregon or Oregon appropriators not parties to the suit. United States v. Oregon, \n295 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 55 S.Ct. 610; Priest v. Board of Trustees of Las Vegas, \n232 \nU.S. 604\n, 34 S.Ct. 443. As to them priority had lapsed, if the claimant had forfeited it by inequitable conduct. The label of the acts is unimportant, whether laches or estoppel or abandonment. What matters is their quality. Persistence in such conduct may extinguish the equitable right. It may bar an equitable remedy. Irrigators in another state, unaffected by the decree, are at liberty to show the facts, and upon the basis of that showing to fix their user of the stream.\n Laches and abandonment, chargeable to the Gardena users, are found in the report. Not till 1930 was there a claim in their behalf to the beneficial use of the waters of the river arising above the bridge. Not till then was such a claim advanced by Washington itself or by any of its residents. Without a sign of challenge, the Oregon users were allowed to develop their little settlement in the faith that their enjoyment of the waters was uncontested by any one. During these many years of growth Gardena Farms in particular evinced by many acts its recognition and acceptance of the existing situation. These acts are narrated carefully in the findings of the master. There is no need to repeat them here. Viewing them collectively, he concludes that the Gardena Farms district has never put the waters of the river arising above Red Bridge to a beneficial use during the irrigation season, that the intention to apply them to such a use was abandoned, if it ever existed, before the commencement of this suit, and that for a period of nearly forty years there has been recognition of the superior right of the Oregon appropriators. Here surely is not the diligence that equity \n\n[297 U.S. 517, 529]\n\u00a0\n exacts of the suitor who invokes its distinctive jurisdiction.\n We have dwelt upon the question of abandonment, for it has been much considered in the report and in the arguments of counsel. In so doing we have not meant to hold that, in the absence of abandonment, there would be an inequitable apportionment calling for relief by injunction, unless indeed the flow of the stream should unexpectedly increase. We are to bear in mind steadily that the controversy is between states, and not between private litigants; the burden and quantum of the proof being governed accordingly. North Dakota v. Minnesota, supra. At present there would be no benefit to Gardena, or none that has been proved, if the waters of the Tum-a-lum were not obstructed by the dam. In all likelihood they would be lost in the deep gravel of the channel and would not reappear beyond until the shortage season had gone by. So also there would be no benefit, or none that has been proved, if the use of the Little Walla Walla were less than it has been. The chief points of junction with the main river are below the intake of the canal where Gardena is privileged to tap the waters of the stream. No evidence brought to our notice by either of the parties carries with it a suggestion that other Oregon priorities would be cut down or displaced if the Gardena priority were established to the full. We need not go into the question more fully at this time.\n The case comes down to this: The court is asked upon uncertain evidence of prior right and still more uncertain evidence of damage to destroy possessory interests enjoyed without challenge for over half a century. In such circumstances, an injunction would not issue if the contest were between private parties, at odds about a boundary.

Messerschmidt, of Madison, Wis., for complainant.\n Messrs. Edward A. Bilitzke, of Lansing, Mich., and Meredith P. Sawyer, of Menominee, Mich., for defendant.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Michigan brought suit in this court against Wisconsin to have ascertained and established a part of the boundary between them. March 1, 1926, we announced our decision. \n270 \nU.S. 295\n, 46 S.Ct. 290. To carry it into effect, the States acting through their counsel agreed upon and submitted a form of decree. November 22, 1926, the court relying \n\n[297 U.S. 547, 548]\n\u00a0\n upon the agreement and consent of the parties entered the decree proposed. \n272 \nU.S. 398\n, 47 S.Ct. 114.\n November 7, 1932, Wisconsin brought this suit against Michigan, alleging that as a result of mistakes of the parties the decree of November 22, 1926, did not carry our decision into effect as to the tracts called 'Grassy Island' and 'Sugar Island' on the north bank and a short distance from the mouth of the Menominee river and as to the Green Bay section of the boundary. Issue was joined, and a special master took evidence, heard counsel for the States, made findings of fact, stated his conclusions of law and recommended a form of decree. The parties filed exceptions to his report and, after hearing counsel, the court May 20, 1935, decided (\n295 \nU.S. 455, 462\n, 55 S.Ct. 786, 788): 'The decree to be entered in this case will establish the boundary through and along, or near, the middle of the waters of Green bay that are here involved. That line commences at a point midway between the piers at the harbor entrance of the Menominee River; thence east by south seven and one- eighth miles; thence approximately north by east one-eighth east, about eight and seven-eighths miles; thence to and along a line in or near the middle of the bay to a point west of the Rock Island passage; thence easterly by courses and distances to be designated through that passage to the boundary in the middle of Lake Michigan. The decree will appropriately define the tracts called 'Grassy Island' and 'Sugar Island' and declare them to belong to Michigan.' And the court ordered (\n295 \nU.S. 455, 463\n, 55 S.Ct. 786, 789): 'The case is referred to the special master and he is directed to prepare and submit to the court a form of decree which will give effect to this ecision. Inasmuch as the preparation of the decree may involve the ascertainment of physical facts and the formulation of technical descriptions, the master is authorized to hear counsel, take evidence and procure such assistance, if any, as may be \n\n[297 U.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n necessary to enable him conveniently and promptly to discharge the duties here imposed upon him. He may call upon counsel to propose forms of decree. He is directed to give them opportunity to submit objections to the form prepared by him and to include the objections, if any, in his report.'\n The master took evidence, viewed the locus, heard counsel, and in accordance with the court's directions filed his report. It includes a form of decree. Wisconsin objects to the proposed decree in respect of the part of the boundary in Green Bay, Rock Island passage and Lake Michigan not defined by our decision of May 20, 1935, and submits for consideration alternative forms of decree. Michigan urges adoption of that proposed by the master.\n After hearing counsel for the respective States, the court does hereby order, adjudge, and decree:\n\n 1. \nWisconsin's objections are overruled. The definitions of the boundary recommended by the master are approved and adopted.\n\n 2. \nThe decree of this court, entered November 22, 1926, in the suit brought by Michigan against Wisconsin, is modified by striking therefrom the provisions that purport to define the parts of the boundary in the Menominee river downstream from the concrete bridge on United States Highways No. 41 between the cities of Menominee, Michigan, and Marinette, Wisconsin, and in the waters of Green Bay, the Rock Island passage and Lake Michigan and by inserting, in lieu of the parts of the decree so stricken out, definitions of the boundary recommended by the master.\n\n 3. \nThe decree in Michigan v. Wisconsin, as modified by this decree, defines and establishes the boundary between these States. As modified, it is as follows:\n It is ordered, adjudged, and decreed:\n That the boundary between the States of Michigan and Wisconsin along the following course be and it is hereby fixed and finally established as follows: \n\n[297 U.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n From Lake Superior through the middle of the main channel of the Montreal river, to the headwaters thereof, as established in the survey of Captain Cram at the junction of the Pine river and Balsam creek (also known as Lehman's creek); thence along the line of the survey of William A.

STATE OF COLO.(1936)\nNo. 10\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 573, 574]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ray E. Lee, James A. Greenwood, and Wm. O. Wilson, all of Cheyenne, Wyo., for the State of Wyoming.\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 573, 575]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Shrader P. Howell, of Denver, Colo., Wm. R. Kelly and C. D. Todd, both of Greeley, Colo., and C. L. Ireland and Charles Roach, both of Denver, Colo., for the State of Colorado.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By this suit the state of Wyoming complains of the state of Colorado and asserts that the latter and her water claimants have been and are departing from a decree rendered by this Court in an earlier suit between these states (\n259 \nU.S. 419\n, 42 S.Ct. 552; \n259 \nU.S. 496\n, 42 S. Ct. 594; \n260 \nU.S. 1\n, 43 S.Ct. 2), and that the asserted departures have been and are working material injury to Wyoming and her water claimants. The principal relief sought is an injunction enforcing adherence to that decree.\n The earlier suit and decree dealt with the relative rights of the two states and their respective water claimants to divert and use for irrigation the waters of the Laramie river, an innavigable stream which has its source in the mountains of Northern Colorado, flows northerly 27 miles in that state, crosses into Wyoming, and there flows northeasterly 150 miles to the North Platte river, of which it is an affluent. That suit was largely provoked by a proposed and threatened diversion in Colorado ( called the Laramie-Poudre tunnel project) of 50,000 acre feet or more from the Laramie river, which Wyoming alleged would not leave in the river sufficient water to satisfy older appropriations in that state.\n Shortly after the present suit was begun, the complainant's right to relief was challenged by a motion to dismiss, one ground of which was that the suit proceeds on the erroneous assumption that the earlier decree determined, as against Colorado and her water claimants, the full quantity of water which rightly may be diverted \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 576]\n\u00a0\n within that state from the stream, and likewise the quantity which Wyoming and her water claimants are entitled to receive and use within her borders. The motion was overruled (\n286 \nU.S. 494\n, 52 S.Ct. 621, 626); the scope of the ruling and the reasons for it being shown in the following excerpts from the opinion then delivered.\n'We are of opinion that the record, opinion, a d decree in the prior suit, here reviewed at length, show very plainly that the decree must be taken as determining the relative rights of the two states, including their respective citizens, to divert and use the waters of the Laramie and its tributaries. These rights were put in issue by the pleadings, displayed in the evidence, and considered and resolved in the opinion. Not only so, but the question of priority in time and right as between the appropriations in Colorado and those in Wyoming was directly presented by the pleadings and evidence and distinctly dealt with and resolved in the opinion.\n\n'As appears from the opinion, the court held that the doctrine, long recognized and enforced in both states, whereby priority of appropriation gives superiority of right, furnished the only equitable and right basis on which to determine the controversy between them shown in the pleadings and evidence.\n\n'And as further appears from the opinion, the court made specific findings showing the amount of water in the available supply, its insufficiency to satisfy all asserted appropriations, the date when the proposed tunnel appropriation in Colorado was initiated, the names and amounts of the appropriations in Colorado which were senior to that appropriation, the amount of water included in the Wyoming appropriations which were senior to it, and the amount which would remain in the supply and be subject to that appropriation after deducting what was required to satisfy the senior appropriations in both states. \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 577]\n\u00a0\n 'These findings were pertinent to the issues, and upon them the court pronounced its decree. Under a familiar rule the facts thus determined are not open to dispute in a subsequent suit between the same states.'\n\n And again:\n'Construing the decree in the light of the record and opinion, to which counsel for both states appeal, we think it was intended to and does define and limit the quantity of water which Colorado and her appropriators may divert from the interstate stream and its tributaries and thus withhold from Wyoming and her appropriators.\n\n'But it is said that water claims other than the tunnel appropriation could not be, and were not, affected by the decree, because the claimants were not parties to the suit or represented therein. In this the nature of the suit is misconceived. It was one between states, each acting as a quasi sovereign and representative of the interests and rights of her people in a controversy with the other. ... The water claimants in Colorado, and those in Wyoming, were represented by their respective states and are bound by the decree.'\n\n The earlier decree, so construed, confirms and establishes 'the right of the State of Colorado, or of any one ecognized by her as duly entitled thereto,' to divert and take wthin that state\n\n\n (1)\n 18,000 acre feet of water per annum from the Laramie river and its tributaries in virtue of the Skyline ditch appropriation;\n\n\n (2)\n 4,250 acre feet of water per annum from such stream and its tributaries in virtue of certain meadowland appropriations;\n\n\n (3)\n The relatively small amount of water appropriated prior to 1902 from the headwaters of Deadman creek, a tributary of the Laramie river, through the Wilson supply ditch; \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 578]\n\u00a0\n (4) 15,500 acre feet of water per annum from the Laramie river and its tributaries, in virtue of the Laramie-Poudre tunnel appropriation;-and that decree also confirms and establishes the right of the state of Wyoming and her water claimants to receive and divert within that state the remaining waters of the stream and its tributaries in virtue of appropriations prior in time and right to the tunnel appropriation in Colorado. A further provision in the decree enjoins the defendant state from diverting or taking from the river and its tributaries in virtue of the tunnel appropriation any water in excess of the confirmed right to 15, 500 acre feet per annum, the reason for limiting the injunction to that appropriation beign that there was no showing of an e igency requiring that it be broader.\n In this view of the earlier suit and decree, we further held, in overruling the motion to dismiss the present suit, that the bill contains allegations of such material departures by Colorado and her water claimants from the earlier decree that she should be called upon to answer. Colorado did answer; evidence was then taken and reported by commissioners; and the cause has since been submitted on briefs and oral argument.\n The departures from the decree which are charged against Colorado in the bill are of two classes-one comprising diversions under claims not confirmed or recognized in the decree, and the other consisting of diversions under each of the confirmed Colorado claims of more water than the decree accredits to the claim. In the answer Colorado denies that certain of the diversions have been excessive or otherwise contrary to the decree, and admits that other designated diversions have not been in accord with the decree as construed in our opinion overruling the motion to dismiss, but asserts that they have been made in good faith and in accord with what the state's officers have understood the decree to be. \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 579]\n\u00a0\n One complaint is of diversions through what are described in the bill and answer as Bob creek ditch, Bob creek extension ditch, Columbine ditch, and Lost Lake reservoir system. These diversions are admitted in the answer. They are made, not under claims recognized or confirmed in the decree, but quite independently of it. Under the decree, as is pointed out in our opinion overruling the motion to dismiss, the Colorado claims which the decree recognizes and confirms are the only ones in virtue of which diversions may be made as against Wyoming and her appropriators. Claims not so recognized and confirmed are excluded. It follows that the diversions just described contravene the decree and infringe Wyoming's rights under it. They were being practiced when the present suit was begun and for a time thereafter, but, when the motion to dismiss was overruled, they were discontinued pending further action by us. Counsel for Colorado now assure us in their brief that the state does not propose to permit a resumption of these diversions if we hold, as we now do, that they contravene the decree. Because of this assurance, which we accept, there is no present need for granting an injunction in respect of these diversions.\n Another complaint is of the diversion of water through the Wilson supply ditch from the headwaters of Deadman creek, a tributary of the Laramie. The substance of the complaint is (a) that there has been no appropriation under which this diversion may be made, and (b) that, even if there has been such an appropriation, the Wilson supply ditch recently has been enlarged and is now made the means of diverting more water from the headwaters of Deadman creek than was included in the appropriation. Neither phase of the complaint is tenable. The decree in the earlier suit ( \n260 \nU.S. 1\n, 43 S.Ct. 2) distinctly recognizes and confirms the existence of an appropriation enabling 'the state of Colorado, or ... any one recognized by \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 580]\n\u00a0\n her as duly entitled thereto,' to divert and take from the headwaters of Deadman creek 'the relatively small amount of water appropriated therefrom prior to the year 1902 by and through what is designated in the evidence as the Wilson Supply Ditch.' Wyoming is bound by this finding and adjudication. While the appropriation is there described as including a 'relatively small amount of water,' the record in that suit, to which the decree refers, shows that the appropriation is of 2,000 acre feet of water per annum-a relatively small amount when contrasted with the other appropriations of 18,000 and 4,250 acre feet which the decree recognizes in its next preceding parts. The decree is to be taken as if the exact amount of this appropriation were written into it.\n While the evidence bearing on the alleged enlargement of the Wilson supply ditch is conflicting, we are persuade by it that what was done was more in the nature of repair than of enlargement. But this is not very material; for the evidence convinces us that the water diverted from the headwaters of Deadman creek through the ditch has not been in excess of 2, 000 acre feet per annum, the amount of the recognized appropriation.\n It is well to state with some emphasis that what we have just said relates to the appropriation through the Wilson supply ditch from the headwaters of Deadman creek. The need for this statement arises out of the fact that other water which forms no part of this appropriation, but is part of the natural flow of Sand creek, is carried by the same ditch from Sand creek to Sheep creek. Sand creek lies between Deadman creek and Sheep creek, and for a part of its length is used as a section of the Wilson supply ditch. We are not here concerned with the diversion or appropriation of the water naturally flowing in Sand creek. \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 581]\n\u00a0\n It is further complained that the diversions made under the meadowland appropriations which are recognized and confirmed in the decree are excessive, in that, while the decree fixes the amount of these appropriations at 4,250 acre feet per annum, the actual diversions thereunder have ranged from 36,000 to 62,000 acre feet per year. In the answer Colorado does not deny that waters greatly in excess of the amount fixed in the decree are taken from the stream into ditches leading to the meadowlands where it is to be applied, but asserts that, after the water is applied, the greater part of it returns to the stream through surface drainage and percolation and that the part actually consumed does not exceed the amount fixed in the decree.\n It is apparent from the opinion in the earlier suit that 4,250 acre feet was fixed as the measure of these appropriations because the water is appropriated for the irrigation of 4,250 acres of native hay meadows, and one acre foot per acre is deemed sufficient for that purpose when the water is rightly and not wastefully applied.\n The evidence shows that the water is being applied to the native hay meadows by a process of continuous flooding, whereby 10 or more acre feet are put on each acre during the irrigating season of 50 or 60 days. That this is a distinctly wasteful process is obvious. It is true that, when water is so applied, a considerable portion ultimatley finds its way back into the stream, unless the place of application be remote from the stream or in another watershed, which is not the case in this instance. But it is also true that a material percentage of the water is lost by evaporation and other natural processes, and that there is no way of determining with even approximate certainty how much of the water returns to the stream.\n Colorado insists that the decree, in fixing the measure of these meadowland appropriations, refers to the \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 582]\n\u00a0\n amount of water consumptively used and not to the amount taken from the stream into the ditches leading to the place of use. The thing dealt with by the decree is described therein as the right 'to divert and take' from the stream and its tributaries a designated amount of water. We think these words refer to the water taken from the stream at the point of diversion, and not to the variable and uncertain part of it that is consumptively used.\n As it is plainly shown that diversions are being made under these meadowland appropriations in quantities largely in excess of the amount fixed in the decree, we think an injunction should issue forbidding further departures from the decree in this regard.\n Another complaint is that the diversions under the Skyline ditch appropriation and those under the Laramie-Poudre tunnel appropriation have been and are in excess of the quantities accredited to them by the decree. In the answer Colorado admits the charge in respect of the Skyline ditch appropriation; denies that the diversions under the Laramie-Poudre tunnel appropriation have been in excess of the quantity accredited to it; and assert that, with the possible exception of the year 1929, the total diversions under the recognized Colorado appropriations have been at all times within the aggregate of the quantities accredited to them severally, and that, consistently with the decree, she lawfully may permit diversions under any of the recognized appropriations in excess of its accredited quantity so long as the total diversions under all do not exceed the aggregate of the quantities accredited to them severally. It is a necessary conclusion from the answer that all of the actual diversions have been made with Colorado's permission express or implied.\n The evidence respecting diversions under the Skyline ditch appropriation and under the tunnel appropriation \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 583]\n\u00a0\n is conflicting; and this is true of the evidence respecting the total diversions under the recognized Colorado appropriations. After considering all of it and such admissions as are made in the answer, we reach the conclusion that the diversions under the Skyline ditch appropriation have exceeded the quantity named in the decree, the excess ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 acre feet per year; that the diversions under the tunnel appropriation have closely approached, but have not exceeded, the quantity fixed in the decree; that the total diversions under the recognized Colorado appropriations, including those for the meadowlands, have uniformly exceeded the aggregate of the quantities which the decree accredits to them severally; and that, if the appropriations and the diversions for the meadow-lands be put aside, the total diversions under the other appropriations have at times closely approached, but at no time have exceeded, the aggregate of the quantities accredited to them as distinct appropriations.\n We already have dealt with the excessive diversions under the meadowland appropriations and have said that an injunction will be granted forbidding any further departure from the decree in that regard. That injunction will eliminate the excess in those diversions; and when that is done, the total diversions under the several appropriations will be, as has just been pointed out, within the aggregate of the quantities which are accredited to them severally by the earlier decree-and this notwithstanding the diversions under the Skyline ditch appropriations are in excess of the quantity accredited to it.\n We therefore must consider the contention made by Colorado that, consistently with the decree, she lawfully may permit diversions under any of the recognized appropriations in excess of its accredited quantity, so long as the total diversions under all do not exceed the aggregate of the quantities accredited to them severally. \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 584]\n\u00a0\n In both Colorado and Wyoming water rights acquired by appropriation are transferable, in whole or in part, either permanently or temporarily; and the use of the water may be changed from the irrigation of one tract to the irrigation of another, if the change does not injure other appropriators. \n1\n The rules in this regard are but incidental to the doctrine of appropriation. That doctrine prevails in both states, and the decree in the earlier suit was based on it. It was not the purpose of that suit or of the decree to withdraw water claims dealt with therein from the operation of local laws relating to their transfer or to restrict their utilization in ways not affecting the rights of one state and her claimants as against the other state and her claimants.\n We perceive no reason for thinking that it is in any wise material to Wyoming and her water claimants whether the water in question is diverted and conveyed to the place of use through the Skyline ditc , the Wilson supply ditch, or the ditches of the Laramie-Poudre tunnel project. All are transmountain ditches and deliver the water in the Cache La Poudre Valley, which is in another watershed.\n The diversions through the transmountain ditches in the quantities here shown are made with the consent of the owners of the water rights and with the full sanction of Colorado. Therefore, as respects the present question, the situation is not different from what it would be had the owners of the other claims formally transferred parts of their water rights to the Skyline owners. The appropriations remain as they were when the decree was entered, and are still limited to the quantities which it \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 585]\n\u00a0\n accredits to them. But the Skyline owners are now permitted by the owners of the other claims and by Colorado to take and use part of the waters included in those claims. Wyoming and her claimants are in no way injured by this. No departure from the decree is involved. The thing which the decree recognizes and confirms is 'the right of the State of Colorado, or of any one recognized by her as duly entitled thereto, ... to divert and take' the water included in the designated appropriations.\n We are accordingly of opinion that in the circumstances here shown the Skyline ditch diversions do not constitute an infraction of the decree.\n In the brief for Wyoming we are asked to adjudicate the relative rights of the two states and of their respective citizens to divert and use the waters of Sand creek, a small interstate stream, which is not a tributary of the Laramie. \n259 \nU.S. 419, 490\n, 42 S.Ct. 552. The bill contains no showing in respect of these rights, there is no prayer in it for their adjudication, and they are not relevant to the controversy which it presents. We therefore must decline to consider them at this time.\n In the bill it is complained that Colorado, although requested so to do, has refused to permit Wyoming to install measuring devices at the places of diversion for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of water being diverted in Colorado from the river and its tributaries, and there is a prayer for a decretal order permitting such installation. The evidence bearing on this matter hardly can be regarded as establishing the propriety of such an order, and yet it tends to show a need for improving the means and methods of measuring the diversions, for keeping accurate and complete records thereof, and for according to the representatives of Wyoming full access to both the measuring devices and the records. Recognizing this need, Colorado in her brief assures us that \n\n[298 U.S. 573, 586]\n\u00a0\n through her officers she will accord to Wyoming's officers free access to the measuring devices and to the registering charts, records, and other available data, will co-operate freely with them in devising an appropriate plan for measuring the diversions, and will give full consideration to such suggestions as they may make respecting the improvement of the measuring equipment. In this situation the order which is asked would be inappropriate. While the problem of measuring and recording the diversions is a difficult one, we entertain the hope that the two states will by co-operative efforts accomplish a satisfactory solution of it. But we think Wyoming should have leave to apply to us for an appropriate order in the matter if the two states are unable to agree and it is found that there is real need for invoking action by us.\n For the reasons given in this opinion, we conclude that the only relief to which Wyoming is now entitled is an injunction forbidding further diversions under the meadowland appropriations of more than 4,250 acre feet per year measured at the headgates through which the water is diverted.\n Such an injunction will be granted. Wyoming will be given leave to apply later on for an appropriate order respecting the measurement and recording of all diversions in the event the two states are unable to agree and there is need for action by this Court jurisdiction of the cause will be retained for the purposes of such an application, and the costs will be taxed one-half to each of the two states.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sieber v.

Rice, of New York City, for appellee.\n\n\n[297 U.S. 553, 570]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought to dissolve the Sugar Institute, Inc., a trade association, and to restrain the sugar refining companies which composed it, and the individual defendants, from engaging in an alleged conspiracy in re- \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 571]\n\u00a0\n straint of interstate and foreign commerce in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.  1 (15 U.S.C.A.  1). Final decree was entered which, while it did not dissolve the Institute, permanently enjoined the defendants from engaging directly or indirectly in forty-five stated activities. Defendants bring a direct appeal to this court under the Act of February 11, 1903, 15 U.S.C.  29 (15 U.S.C.A.  29).\n The record is unusually voluminous. \n1\n The court rendered an exhaustive opinion and made detailed findings of fact (218 in number) with conclusions of law, describing and characterizing the transactions involved. Numerous assignments of error broadly challenge its rulings and the case has been presented here in extended oral arguments and elaborate briefs. We shall attempt to deal only with the salient and controlling points of the controversy. These involve (1) the special characteristics of the sugar industry and the practices which obtained before the organization of the Sugar Institute, (2) the purposes for which the Institute was founded, (3) the agreement and practices of the members of the Institute, and (4) the application of the Anti-Trust And and the provisions of the decree.\n First. The sugar industry and practices prior to the formation of the Sugar Institute.-Domestic refined sugar, best sugar, and foreign and insular refined sugar, known in the trade as 'off-shore' refined, constitute about 99 per cent. of the nation's supply. The remainder, consisting of domestic cane sugar, refined particularly in Louisiana, does not appear to be an important factor in the national markets. The fifteen defendant companies, members of the Institute, refine practically all the im- \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 572]\n\u00a0\n ported raw sugar processed in this country. Their product is known as 'domestic refined.' Prior to the organization of the Institute in 1927, they provided more than 80 per cent. of the sugar consumed in the United States, and they have since supplied from 70 to 80 per cent. Their proportion of the supply is even greater in the New England and Middle Atlantic States, being more than 90 per cent., while in all but a few states their share is more than 55 per cent. Each of the refiners is engaged extensively in interstate commerce. Their refineries are in the vicinity of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Savannah, New Orleans, Galveston, and San Francisco. The raw cane sugar which they use is imported principally from Cuba and to some extent from the insular possessions.\n Beet sugar for many years has been an important factor in the domestic market. It is produced and sold chiefly in the middle and far West, providing in some states over 75 per cent. of the supply, and it competes with other sugars in a number of Southern and Middle Atlantic States. Off-shore sugar is refined principally in Cuba and to some extent in the insular possessions. Its important trade areas have been the Middle, Atlantic, and Southern States; in some states it constitutes from 25 to 40 per cent. of the total supply. Both beet sugar and off-shore sugar are sold at a small differential below defendants' sugar. The trial court found that there was no agreement between defendants and the beet sugar manufacturers, or with the off-shore interests, to maintain any differential.\n The court found that the defendants' refined can sugar 'is a thoroughly standardized commodity in physical and chemical properties.' In exceptional cases and localities, certain of the defendants had built up a preference for brand names 'sufficient before and after the Institute was organized to enable such brands to command a higher \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 573]\n\u00a0\n price than the sugar of the other defendants in sales from sugar dealers to their trade.' In sales by refiners to manufacturers of products containing sugar-about one-third of the sugar consumed-'price, not brand, was always the vital consideration.' And in the other sales, 'one refiner could not ordinarily, by virtue of preference for his brand, obtain a higher price except insofar as another refiner might be giving a lower price by secret concessions.'\n The court further found that the 'basis prices,'2 quoted by the several refiners in any particular trade area, 'were generally uniform both before and after the Institute, because economically the defendants' sugar, save for exceptional instances was and is a thoroughly standardized product.'\n It is a fundamental and earnest contention of defendants that the occasion for the formation of the Institute was the existence of grossly unfair and uneconomical practices in the trade, and that a proper appraisal of the motives and transactions of defendants cannot be made without full appreciation of the sorry condition into which the industry had fallen.\n During the years 1917 to 1919, when the industry was under governmental control, prices were fixed and all forms of concessions and rebates were forbidden. The court found that, perhaps as early as 1921 and increasingly thereafter, the practice developed on the part of some, but not all, refiners of giving secret concessions. There were five refiners3 who never indulged in that prac- \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 574]\n\u00a0\n tice, but the others, called 'unethical' refiners, did so to such an extent that at least 30 per cent. of all the sugar sold by the refiners in 1927 carried secret concessions of some kind. The need of secrecy was urgent, for as soon as it was known that a specific concession was granted it would be generally demanded. That concessions were widely granted was generally known in the trade, and while each refiner was able to find out in a general way the approximate prices and terms of his competitors, it was impossible to know with any degree of accuracy the actual prices and terms granted in the innumerable transactions. The court also found that various causes contributed to the development of these selling methods on the part of the unethical refiners, chief among which was an overcapacity since the war of at least 50 per cent. Other probable causes were the lack of statistical information as to amount of production, deliveries and stocks on hand, leading to overproduction, the uncertainties prevailing in the market for raw sugar which made the refined sugar industry highly speculative, the fact that, since 1922, most sugar has been sold through brokers, and the standardization of defendants' products which made their sales almost entirely dependent upon prices, terms, and conditions. The concessions granted were largely, although not entirely, arbitrary. They were given principally to large buyers, but no system was followed in that respect. Even though there may not have been extensive resort to misrepresentations, 'defendants entertained genuine fears that purchasers were falsely representing prices which they said they could procure from competing sellers.'\n Consumption of sugar in the United States decreased in 1927. The public 'slimness c mpaign' of that year had substantial effect in discouraging the use of sugar. Certain distributors refrained from pushing sales because they could not sell profitably, but others were aggressive \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 575]\n\u00a0\n and sugar was generally available. While certain smaller distributors suffered because of the advantage enjoyed by some larger ones, that advantage was attributable in the greatest measure to efficiency, and the larger distributors did not obtain monopolies. The court found that there was 'no substantial evidence that the situation caused, or would cause, substantial injury to the 'ethical' refiners as a class,' although they may have been inconvenienced and probably believed that the sales methods of their competitors were harmful. The declining profits for the year 1927 were attributable at least in large part, the court found, to causes other than the secret concession system, such as the 'slimness campaign,' overproduction, and dumping.\n But whatever question there may be as to particulars, the evidence and findings leave no doubt that the industry was in a demoralized state which called for remedial measures. The court summed up the facts in the following finding:\n'29. The industry was characterized by highly unfair and otherwise uneconomic competitive conditions, arbitrary, secret rebates and concessions were extensively granted by the majority of the companies in most of the important market areas and the widespread knowledge of the market conditions necessary for intelligent, fair competition were lacking. The refiners were disturbed economically and morally over the then prevailing conditions. At least one refiner, American4 was concerned about the possibility of liability under the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730) because of the discriminations resulting from the various concessions.'\n\n Second. The purposes for which the Institute was founded.-Defendants emphasize the nature of the proceedings taken in the formation of the Institute. The \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 576]\n\u00a0\n court found that the refiners held a series of meetings, beginning in the summer of 1927, for a discussion of conditions 'with particular reference to undesirable practices and secret concessions.' In September of that year, there was submitted to the Department of Justice a proposed certificate of incorporation and by-laws for a trade association, together with a number of suggestions respecting trade practices. A 'Code of Ethics' was likewise submitted to the Department of Justice and discussed with its officials, with the result that some changes were made, and the Code as concertedly adopted in January, 1928, was substantially identical with that worked out when those discussions were held. The court found that 'with the exception of two minor changes, the Code has retained its original form.' It has been supplemented from time to time by 'Interpretations,' that is, rulings interpreting or amplifying the provisions of the Code. The Department of Justice made three investigations of the Institute in 1928, 1929, and 1930and had complete access to the files of the Institute. As new issues of the 'Code' and 'Interpretations' were printed, copies were forwarded to the Department.\n Defendants stress their dealings with the Department of Justice as evidence of their good faith and of the propriety and legality of their purposes. 'The functionings of the Institute,' they insist, 'were always under the eye of the Department.' The court, however, found that the Department 'was not notified of various important steps taken by the Institute in connection with illegal restraints,' nor was it notified 'as to those activities charged by the Government and denied by defendants in this case.' The Department did not conduct a comprehensive investigation of the restraints here involved until the end of 1930\n\n\n Defendants urge that the abolition of the vicious and discriminatory system of secret concessions, thr ugh the \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 577]\n\u00a0\n adoption of the principle of open prices publicly announced, without discrimination, was their dominant purpose in forming the Institute, and that other purposes were the supplying of accurate trade statistics, the elimination of wasteful practices, the creation of a credit bureau, and the institution of an advertising campaign. The court recognized the existence of these purposes in its finding:\n'35. Among the purposes of the defendants in organizing the Institute were: (a) the selling of sugar on open, publicly announced prices, terms, and conditions; (b) the gathering of trade statistics not previously available; (c) the elimination of practices which they deemed wasteful; and (d) the institution of an advertising campaign to increase consumption. But these purposes were for the most part only incidental to defendants' actual dominant purposes in forming and operating under the Institute.'\n\n The 'dominant purposes' were found to be as follows:\n'36. I find that defendants' dominant purposes in organizing the Institute were: to create and maintain a uniform price structure, thereby eliminating and suppressing price competition among themselves and other competitors; to maintain relatively high prices for refined, as compared with contemporary prices of raw sugar; to improve their own financial position by limiting and suppressing numerous contract terms and conditions; and to make as certain as possible that no secret concessions should be granted. In their efforts to accomplish these purposes, defendants have ignored the interests of distributors and consumers of sugar.'\n\n Defendants charge that the finding as to the illegality of their dominant purposes was 'wholly without foundation.' They charge that the finding was built upon an 'inherent suspicion' and not upon the evidence. The Government answers by pointing to the elaborate review \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 578]\n\u00a0\n of the evidence in the court's opinion and findings. We think that it is manifest that the findings as to dominant purposes was not based upon any assumption a priori, but was an inference of fact which the court drew from the facts it deemed to be established with respect to the scope of the agreement between the members of the Institute and the actual nature and effect of their concerted action. The court found that the defendants 'in most of their activities' had 'gone much further than was reasonably necessary to accomplish their professed aims of eliminating fraud, waste and secret, unfair or illegal discrimination.' The pith of the matter is in the following finding:\n'37. At the inception of the Institute, defendants adopted a general agreement ostensibly to abolish all discriminations between customers but which in general purpose and effect amounted to an agreement not to afford different treatment to different customers, regardless of the varying circumstances of particular transactions or classes of transactions and regardless of the varying situation of particular refiners, distributors or customers or classes thereof. Under the guise of performing the agreement, against discriminations, defendants limited and suppressed numerous important contract terms and conditions in the particulars herein set forth, chiefly for the purpose and with the effect of accomplishing the objectives described in finding 36.'\n\n We turn to the transactions from which the inference of purpose is drawn.\n Third. The agreement and practices of the members of the Institute.- The evidence consists of the 'Code of Ethics' and 'Interpretations,' oral testimony, the minutes of the Institute, and correspondence. Eliminating charges not sustained, the findings of restraints of trade rest upon the basic agreement of the refiners to \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 579]\n\u00a0\n sell only upon prices and terms openly announced, and upon certain supplementary restrictions.\n\n 1. \nThe 'basic agreement.'-The 'Code of Ethics' provided as follows: 'All discriminations between customers should be abolished. To that end, sugar should be sold only upo open prices and terms publicly announced.'\n There was nothing new in the mere advance announcement of prices. The court found that prior to the Institute, 'general price changes were listed on the Refiners' Bulletin Boards, and brokers, customers and news agencies were notified, and frequently, as a courtesy, competitors would be telephoned. Except for notifying the Institute, price changes during the post-Institute period have been announced in this way. ... Before the Institute, general price changes, including general changes in the selling bases of the 'unethical' refiners, were disseminated and became known to the entire trade very quickly.'\n These price announcements must be considered in the light of the trade practice known as 'moves.' The great bulk of sugar, as the court found, 'always was and is purchased on what is known in the trade as 'moves,' although very substantial quantities are sold from time to time apart from moves.' A 'move' takes place when the refiners make public announcements that at a fixed time they will advance their selling price to a named figure, either higher than the presently current selling price or higher than a reduced price which the announcements offer before the advance. Some period of grace was always allowed during which sugar could be bought at the price prevailing before the advance. And in order to obtain their sugar at the lower price, the trade, unless it was felt that the move occurred at too high a price, would then enter into contracts covering their needs for \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 580]\n\u00a0\n at least the next thirty days. Defendants point out that in actual practice the initial announcements might be made by any one of the refiners and that the move actually takes place only if all refiners follow a similar course. If any one fails to follow with a like announcement, the others must withdraw their advance, since sugar is a completely standardized commodity.\n Under the system of the Institute, there was no obligation to give the Institute the first notice of a change in price. The open announcements to the trade were to be made in the customary manner and notified to the Institute which would relay the announcements. Prior to the Institute, when an advance in price was announced, the period of grace allowed for purchasing at the old price was uncertain. Sometimes it was very short, a matter of hours; sometimes sugar buyers who did not learn of the move in time, sent their orders in too late to buy at the old price. By an 'interpretation,' the Institute recommended that the members 'announce changes in price not later than three o'clock.' In its earlier form, this hour was to be that 'of the day before the changed price becomes effective.' But these words were deleted in 1929, and thereafter the announced price advances could be made effective at once. In practice, however, price advances continued to be announced to become effective the following day or even later. The court found that the effect of the 'Three o'clock Rule,' in and of itself, 'seems to have been advantageous to the trade in case of a price advance in that the uncertain period of grace has been replaced by a definite one.'\n The court further found that the refiners 'did not consult with one another after an advance had been announced by one of them and that the grace period was not in fact used by them to persuade a reluctant member to follow the example set, despite the business necessity of withdrawing an advance unless it were followed by \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 581]\n\u00a0\n all.' The court found 'no agreement among defendants on basis prices in the sense of an agreement to adopt a certain basis price from time to time and to maintain it during any period. Frequently an announcement by one refiner of an advance would result in a series of announcements by others, ultimately leading to a decline. Often, too, the advance would be withdrawn because one refiner would refrain from following the announcement. Except in a few instances, a decline announcement was followed by all.' 'Data respecting price changes have be n circulated by the Institute without comment' and there appear to have been no 'price discussions' at Institute meetings.\n There had been a practice in the trade called 'repricing'-of 'making price declines retroactive to sales made at previous higher price.' That occurred usually when a decline was announced late in the day and was applied to all of that day's business. The court found that during the first few months of the Institute, defendants attempted to prevent repricing but the prohibition proved impracticable and was abandoned. By a ruling in November, 1928, it was provided that 'the custom of the trade permits the customer the benefit of the refiner's lowest price during the day, that is, a contract entered into or sugar delivered in the morning may be repriced at any lower price announced during the day.' The court in its finding on this point stated that the ruling was evidently intended to prevent repricing beyond the period stated and 'must have had some effect in discouraging it.' Defendants challenge this criticism in view of the fact also found that refiners occasionally have repriced beyond the stated period, a practice which defendants say 'had never prevailed in the pre- Institute period,' and defendants insist that what the Code actually did was 'to insure that repricing should be done publicly, with the benefit extended to all customers alike, \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 582]\n\u00a0\n and not done secretly for the benefit only of the concessionaries.'\n The distinctive feature of the 'basic agreement' was not the advance announcement of prices, or a concert to maintain any particular basis price for any period, but a requirement of adherence, without deviation, to the prices and terms publicly announced. Prior to the Institute, the list prices which many of the 'unethical' refiners announced, 'were merely nominal quotations and bore no relation to the actual 'selling bases' at which their sugar was sold. ... The selling price was the price at which they purported to sell; the secret concessions were from this basis.' And, in the case of some of the 'unethical' refiners, changes in selling bases were made from time to time without formal public announcement in advance. The Institute sought to prevent such departures. As defendants put it: 'Having adopted the principle of open prices and terms, without discrimination among customers, as the means of remedying the evils of the secret concession system, the defendants lived up to the principle.' The court found:\n'40. Under the Institute, defendants agreed to sell, and in general did sell sugar only upon open prices, terms and conditions publicly announced in advance of sales, and they agreed to adhere and in general did adhere without deviation, to such prices, terms and conditions until they publicly announced changes.'\n\n It was because of the range and effect of this restriction, and the consequent deprivation of opportunity to make special arrangements, that the court found that the agreement and the course of action under it constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade. The court deemed it to be reasonably certain that 'any unfair method of competition caused by the secret concession system' could have been prevented by 'immediate \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 583]\n\u00a0\n publicity given to the prices, terms and conditions in all closed transactions,' without an agreement to sell only on the basis 'of open public announcement in advance of sales.' A 'purpose and effect' of that agreement, the court found, was to aid defendants in preventing and limiting 'certain types of transactions in which private negotiations are essential.' Its operation 'tended in fact, as it naturally would tend, toward maintenance of price levels relatively high as compared with raws.'\n The court found that 'the number of price changes for refined as compared to raw sugar' had been relatively less since the Institute than before. This was 'too marked to be explained by the drop in raw prices.' There was 'a marked increase in margin and a substantial increase in profits despi e a concededly large excess capacity.' The relatively higher price level for the refined sugar, as compared with raw, was such 'as to negate the prevalence of free competition.' Factors 'largely responsible' for this relative stability of prices 'and for the maintenance of price levels regardless of supply and demand, observable since the Institute,' were the dissemination among the refiners of statistical information, 'while withholding it in large part from the buyers,' and the steps taken by defendants 'to eliminate the possibilities of price various to distributors or ultimate purchasers at any given time and thereby to deprive them of the opportunity, by underselling, to disturb the price structure.' Other factors were 'the friendly cooperative spirit which the Institute brought to the Industry' and the assurance to each refiner that he need meet only the prices, terms, and conditions announced by his competitors in advance of sales.\n The court also took note of the fact that the Institute, in connection with practically all of its activities, had \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 584]\n\u00a0\n obtained a high degree of cooperation' with the Domestic Sugar Bureau,' the trade association of the domestic beet sugar manufacturers. That association had its 'Code of Ethics,' substantially identical with that of the Institute. There was also co-operation with the 'offshore interests.' But in neither case was there any agreement as to prices or price differentials.\n Contending that the trial court fell into 'fundamental error,' defendants assert that the Institute made no change in the historic marketing system of the sugar industry. They say, first, that the code and its interpretations did not in terms call for price announcements in advance of sales. As to sales on 'moves,' they say that the code principle and price announcement interpretations 'of course worked out in actual practice into sales only on prices and terms announced in advance of sales, because of the very nature and conditions of a sugar move.' As to the 'small day-to-day sales between moves,' they say that while it was probably 'the general understanding' that strict observance of the principle required public announcements of a lowered price or better terms before sale, there was no evidence as to the actual practice in that regard. They explain that the Institute continued to operate 'under the move system' because it is 'a natural growth essential to the economical conduct of the sugar business.' The cost of raw sugar makes up about four- fifths of the cost of the refined sugar. Raw prices fluctuate widely from day to day and substantially control the price of refined. Wholesale and retail distributors sell on a narrow margin of 5 or 10 cents a bag. They cannot afford to stock large supplies because of storage costs, dangers of deterioration, and the hazardous nature of the business. But, on the other hand, distributors have to buy considerable quantities in order to take advantage of carload freight rates and handling costs. The result of all these forces is the system 'of buying on \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 585]\n\u00a0\n moves every month or two.' To this, both large and small dealers have adapted themselves. By reason of the general practice, they are all on an equal footing as to the periodic fluctuations in price. On each move they have laid in a supply for a month or more. Having bought their current supplies at the same general market level the distributors must 'sell out their current supplies with due regard to that level in order to avoid crippling losses from an intervening decline.' This, defendants say, is 'one of the greatest economic advantages of the move system.'\n Defendants concede the correctness of the statement of the trial court that if immediate publicity had been given to prices and terms in all 'closed transactions,' competitive pressure would have been so great that the refiners 'would either have had to abandon the discriminatory concessions or extend them to all.' They concede that it is 'publicity' that prevents such concessions and 'not the sequence in time between the sale and the publicity.' But they raise the fundamental objection that the proposal is not adaptable to the sugar industry. They say that in an industry which 'has traditionally, and for good reason, sold its products on 'moves,' through the mechanism of announcing price changes in advance of sales in order that buyers may have an opportunity to buy before the price rises, it is not helpful to suggest a system of announcing price changes after sales.'\n Defendants' argument on this point is a forcible one, but we need not follow it through in detail. For the question, as we have seen, is not really with respect to the practice of making price announcements in advance of sales, but as to defendants' requirement of adherence to such announcements without the deviations which open and fair competition might require or justify. The court below did not condemn mere open price announcements in advance of sales. The court was careful to say \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 586]\n\u00a0\n in its opinion that it found it 'unnecessary to pass upon the legality of the use of the Institute' for relaying such announcements, 'if each refiner entirely independently of the others voluntarily made his own announcements without obligation to adhere thereto.'\n Defendants also review at length the relative prices and profits in the periods before and during the Institute. They insist that it is unfair to include in the comparison the earnings for either 1927 or 1928, because each year was abnormal, and they contend that if a truly representative comparison of results were obtained by using the years 1925 and 1926 as the pre-Institute years, and those for 1929 and 1930as the post-Institute years, it would appear that the increase in the later period of the net earnings of the refiners was less than one-half of one per cent. Accordingly they reach the conclusion that their activities did not actually restrain, or tend to restrain, effective competition.\n But we are not left to inferences from trends of prices and profits. The 'basic agreement' cannot be divorced from the steps taken to make it effective, and the requirements of the Institute must be viewed in the light of the particular opportunities which they cut off or curtailed. The crucial question-whether, in the ostensible effort to prevent unfair competition, the resources of fair competition have been impaired-is presented not abstractly but in connection with various concrete restrictions to which the decree below was addressed.\n\n 2. \nSupplementary restrictions.-The requirements and practices designed to support the basic agreement, and which the trial court condemned, relate to the employment of brokers and warehousemen, transportation, consignment points, longterm contracts, quantity discounts, and other contract terms and conditions, and to the withholding of statistical information. \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 587]\n\u00a0\n [a] Brokers and warehousemen.-Most of defendants' sales are negotiated through brokers who receive their commissions from the refiners. The court found that prior to the Institute, a broker and a warehouseman 'were frequently one,' and might also be 'a merchant or other sugar user'; that concerns which thus combined distribution functions frequently performed a valuable service to the industry; that defendants required an election of but one of these activities and the complete cessation of each of the others; that defendants made and rigorously enforced an agreement that refiners should refuse to deal with a broker, warehouseman, or customer who acted directly or indirectly for any of them, or for any other sugar interest, 'in other than the one elected capacity'; that each refiner submitted to the Institute lists of its brokers and warehouses which were then circulated among the refiners, and those disqualified were dropped from the lists; that this policy was carried out in a harsh and arbitrary manner without regard to the effect upon third parties; that the commissions to be paid brokers were agreed upon, but there was no subs antial evidence that the commissions were not fair, the object being to prevent a growing competition in bidding for brokers' services; that defendants agreed that they would not deal with any broker or warehouseman who did not sign a contract according to a form recommended by the Institute; that the warehouse agreement provided that if the warehouseman granted any concession or rebate, secret or otherwise, to any customer without granting it to all, an equal amount should be forfeited to the employing refiner; that the brokers' agreement prohibited concessions and imposed an obligation to uphold the Institute's code and its interpretations. This course of dealing, the court held, unreasonably restrained trade.\n Defendants urge that the broker is the refiner's agent to sell to customers and the warehouseman is the refiner's \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 588]\n\u00a0\n agent for storage and delivery; that these agents act as a check on each other; that the refiners' concerted adoption of the principle against storing in customers' and brokers' warehouses was essential both to prevent discrimination among customers and to avoid impositions and frauds upon the refiners; that if the warehouseman is himself the purchaser of the sugar, the refiner is deprived of his independence and disinterestedness and the purchaser has control of the sugar with the power of withdrawing it at will and reporting that withdrawal at his pleasure; that similarly storage with brokers facilitated fraudulent practices; and that where the warehouseman and the broker were the same, neither was under any supervision and the broker-warehouseman could do practically what he pleased with the refiner's property and business.\n To a considerable degree the court recognized the force of these contentions. The court found that a combination of distribution functions facilitated secret concessions, difficult of detection, and created opportunities for double dealing. But, despite this, it had been common for refiners, before the Institute, to employ brokers and warehousemen engaged in other distribution functions, and that such arrangements from the refiners' viewpoint were not infrequently entirely successful; and that concerns in substantial numbers, which combined distribution functions, maintained entire good faith in their dealings with the refiners. The court concluded that there was a definite possibility of lower prices to ultimate consumers as a result of combination of functions, because the increased income thus made possible, even apart from advantages obtained through secret concessions and fraudulent practices, gave opportunity 'to outsell competitors who engage in only one occupation.' The most important purpose of defendants, the court found, in compelling the separation of occupations was to aid in preserving 'the uniformity of price structure,' which would \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 589]\n\u00a0\n otherwise be threatened. The court deemed it reasonably certain that defendants could have secured adequate protection against illicit practices by means far less drastic, that is, through investigations, inspections, and publicity for which the Institute had unlimited resources.\n The finding of purpose and of the adequacy of alternative measures is sharply contested. But, while the parties present their respective views as to the details of evidence, there is no room for doubt as to the nature and effect of the restrictions actually imposed through the Institute. The findings of the court as to agreement and practice are fully supported.\n\n\n (b)\n Transportation.-The custom of the trade was to quote sugar f.o.b. refinery. Since the price was usually the same or varied but slightly, individual refiners sold in areas enjoying lower freight rates from other refineries by paying or absorbing part of the transportation charges. That is, the refiner added to the refinery price the amount of his 'ruling freight basis' or 'freight application,' which was the amount the customer was to pay as distinguished from the actual cost of the transportation. The freight situati n was complicated by the existence of differential routes, involving all-water or a combination of water and rail transportation. Traditionally in the industry, refiners' freight applications on sugar delivered at Great Lakes ports openly broke down during the season of open navigation to the Philadelphia lake and rail rate, and during 1926 and 1927 the freight application on sugar sold in the Warrior River area (Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, and parts of Indiana) had openly broken down to New Orleans barge rates, regardless of the way in which the sugar actually moved. The areas affected by these breakdowns were of vital importance, as competition there was especially keen.\n In the effort to prevent the 'sale' of transportation below 'cost,' the Code of Ethics, paragraph 3(c), con- \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 590]\n\u00a0\n demned 'the use of differential rates on consignments, or otherwise than on direct shipments over differential routes at customers' request.' This policy was amplified by an interpretation. The trial court found that but 'slight effort was made to enforce Code 3(c) after the summer of 1928,' that it 'was abandoned at least by the fall of 1929 and probably much earlier,' and that the code interpretation was finally rescinded in September, 1930.\n The court found that the transportation problems in the Great Lakes and Warrior River areas were finally solved by a system of delivered prices, with denial of the privilege of purchasing f.o.b. refinery. The court did not find that there was an agreement in introducing the delivered prices, but did find that defendants 'agreed to maintain and concertedly maintained the system of delivered prices' in both the areas above mentioned; also that through the Institute defendants 'concertedly policed delivered prices and investigated alleged departures therefrom'; and that these prices were 'patently unreasonable.' Defendants vigorously deny that delivered prices were either introduced or maintained through any concert of action. They submit that the evidence not only does not warrant that finding, but shows affirmatively that delivered prices were introduced independently by individual refiners and resulted solely from unrestrained competition.\n As the court said in its opinion, the controversy was chiefly about what defendants had actually done during the Institute period, and the facts were frequently 'bitterly disputed.' We need not discuss the rival contentions. The court found that defendants' 'adoption of Code 3(c), their actions pursuant thereto, and their concerted maintenance of delivered prices constituted undue and unreasonable restraint of trade.' Defendants have waived their assignment of error as to this finding in \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 591]\n\u00a0\n order to reduce the issues presented on this appeal. And defendants have also waived their assignments of error as to the provisions in the decree enjoining concerted action in 'determining transportation charges or freight applications to be collected from customers, or limiting freight absorptions' and in 'selling only on delivered prices or on any system of delivered prices, including zone prices, or refusing to sell f.o.b. refinery.'\n Questions are presented with respect to miscellaneous 'transportation activities.' They relate to defendants' agreement to prevent transiting and diversion by customers when these would defeat freight applications; to concerted action in obtaining an agreement from transportation companies operating on the New York State Barge Canal that they would carry sugar only on the basis of openly announced rates and terms from which they would not deviate without open announcement; to recommendations of the Institute, concertedly observed, that none of the members should ship sugar on his own account by private charter except when the charter was arranged directly between refiner and carrier and refiner was satisfied that no broker, buyer, or warehouseman was participating in the rate, and that the terms of every such private charter should be submitted to the scrutiny of the exe utive secretary of the Institute; to defendants' concerted refusal to participate in pool shipments, with sugar shipped on their own account, in order to aid customers in making up the required minima for cargo or carload rates; and to defendants' agreement 'to use only trucking concerns not affiliated with any buyer, broker, or warehouse and then only under non-rebating contracts.' The court found that defendants' action went further than was necessary to prevent secret rebating and amounted to unreasonable restraints. We see no reason for disturbing the findings on these subjects.\n\n\n (c)\n Consignment points.-Prior to 1925, the refiners maintained, on their respective accounts, stocks at \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 592]\n\u00a0\n a few strategic points from which sugar was distributed to the surrounding areas. During the period 1925 to 1927, refiners placed stocks at numerous points solely for the local trade. Defendants regarded this increase as an outstanding evil and made a concerted effort to bring about reductions. To this end the Institute obtained the cooperation of the Domestic Sugar Bureau and other nonmembers. In recommending consignment points in the South, ports of entry like reconsignment points were separately classified, and Wilmington, N.C., was eliminated.\n Defendants insist that the expense involved in maintaining an excessive number of consignment points was an economic waste without any substantial compensating advantage to the consuming public, and that the effort at reduction was a legitimate function of the Institute. The economic questions were fully considered by the trial court which found that the refiners' consignment service 'was valuable and beneficial to substantial elements in the trade'; that limitation of ports of entry was more serious than elimination of ordinary consignment points in so far as it shut a competitor out of a particular territory; that while the cost of increased consignment points might well be reflected in a higher general basis price, there was no assurance that the savings through some reductions would be passed on to consumers generally; that the result in either case was 'largely speculative'; that communities eliminated as consignment points 'suffered as against neighboring ones' because of the advantage accruing to the latter; and that there were also eliminated from distributing agencies one type of jobber called the 'desk jobber' who was able to do business without any stock of his own. In summary, the court found that defendants' 'concerted conduct with respect to elimination and reduction of consignment points, reconsignment points and ports of entry' unreasonably re- \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 593]\n\u00a0\n strained trade. The controlling facts are established, and the question again is one of justification.\n\n\n (d)\n Various contract terms and conditions.-One question relates to 'long term contracts,' that is, those permitting the buyer to take delivery more than thirty days after date. Prior to the World War, thirty day contracts were customary for all except manufacturers who were granted sixty days. While there was no definite practice after the war, long term contracts were not infrequent. They were granted by California refiners to Pacific Coast canners. The court found that long term contracts had 'a real economic value to refiner and to consumer'; that some of them tend to bring about greater evenness of production through the year, thus effectuating economies and enabling manufacturers promptly to know the cost of this element of their finished products.\n Defendants contest the finding of the court that they engaged in concerted action 'in prohibiting all long term contracts,' and assert that 'they never have had and do not now have any desire to prohibit them.' Hence, they add, the court's injunction against such action 'does not disturb them.' But they object to the finding that concerted action in insisting upon open announcement in advance of entering into such contracts was without justification. This, as defendants say, is but a condemnation of a particular application of their basic principle that sugar should be sold only upon open prices and terms without discrimination. In the view of the trial court, this application is an illustration of its point that an obligation to adhere to such advance announcements 'would tend to prevent many entirely fair contracts.' Of similar import is the finding that defendants were not justified in acting concertedly to determine whether and to what extent 'the rigid enforcement of the thirty day contract' should be relaxed. \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 594]\n\u00a0\n Another question which has received extended consideration is that of 'quantity discounts.' Prior to the Institute, there was no systematic practice in this respect. The majority of discounts were given to the large buyer but they were often granted to the smaller buyer as well, and the amount of the discount 'bore little relation to the amount of the purchases or the method of taking delivery.' This, the court found, was the natural result of the 'secret concession system' which had prevailed. Carrying out its policy as to discriminations, the Institute condemned 'as unbusinesslike, uneconomic and unsound, concessions made to purchasers on the basis of quantity purchased.' The court found that this agreement and the practice under it prohibited not only 'unsystematic and secret quantity discounts,' but also discounts 'systematically graded according to quantity.' The court examined defendants' contention that quantity discounts would effect no economies. If, said the court, the facts were as defendants insisted, the question would arise whether such a concerted restraint was reasonable. But the court considered the actual facts to be 'entirely inconsistent with defendants' position.' As to direct costs, the court found that the refiners got no discount for quantity purchases of raws which constitute about 80 per cent. of the cost of refined; that quantity sales effected no appreciable direct savings is manufacturing costs and no savings in brokerage; but that in sales to those who could take deliveries in carload lots direct from the refinery, there were substantial savings 'in delivery, storage, bookkeeping and other incidental expenses.' And as to indirect costs, the court found that sales which distribute production more evenly through the year effect substantial savings to the refiners and that the demand for sugar is elastic, so that encouragement of large sales through quantity discounts might reasonably be expected to build up total production and thus effect economies. \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 595]\n\u00a0\n Also that a quantity discount to wholesalers selling to manufacturers as well as to manufacturers buying directly from refiners, might well result in a substantial increase in sugar consumption.\n Defendants contest these economic conclusions. But we are not convinced that the findings are contrary to the evidence. Moreover, the limited provision of the decree should be regarded. In this relation, the decree enjoins defendants from concerted action in 'preventing, restraining or refusing to grant quantity or other discounts where such discounts reflect, effect, or result in economies to refiners either in direct or indirect costs.'\n With a single exception, defendants do not ask the court to review the findings with respect to credit arrangements known as 'the four payment plan,' 'split billing,' and 'cash discount'; or as to 'price guarantee' and 'second hand sugar or resales.' They say that in each case questions of fact alone are raised and they disclaim having taken, or having any desire to take, any action with respect to these subjects which is enjoined by the decree. The exception refers to the practice of 'requiring buyers to elect and specify at the time of entering contract, without privilege of change, the prices and\/or terms in cases where the refiner had more than one price or different terms in different or the same territories.' This restriction is defended as a necessary corollary of the principle of open prices and terms without discrimination, and t e question is as to the legality of the restraint in the application of that principle.\n Other questions concern practices in relation to 'damaged sugar and frozen stocks,' 'tolling,' 'used bag allowances,' and 'private brands.' The court found that the restraints imposed in these matters were unreasonable. They appear to be of minor importance and we think it unnecessary to state the particular facts. \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 596]\n\u00a0\n [e] Statistical information.-Some statistical information collected by the Institute was supplied only to its members; some was supplied as well to representatives of off-shore refiners. The data disseminated by the Institute to the purchasing trade consisted of weekly statistics as to the total melt (production) and total deliveries, and monthly statistics of total deliveries, of all sugar, divided so as to show the amount of domestic cane, imported cane, and beet sugar delivered during the period. These statistics were widely distributed through newsagencies, banks and brokers. The total refined stocks on hand could be computed by subtracting from the total melt of each week the total deliveries. During recent years when refined stocks were greatly increasing, defendants continued to supply to the trade weekly statistics on melt and deliveries from which the trade could readily calculate the increase. Data as to the capacity of the several refiners were available to the public in substantially similar form to that obtained by the Institute. It also appeared that in May, 1931, after the present suit was begun, statistics were released to the trade showing the total consumption of cane, beet, foreign and insular refined sugar by States, for the years 1928, 1929, and 1930, together with figures showing the per capita consumption of each state during the same years.\n The trial court found that none of the other statistics supplied to members or offshore refiners were available except through the Institute and none were supplied or available to the trade. What the court considered to be 'vital data' relating to production and deliveries of individual refiners, to deliveries by states, to deliveries by states by all the important differential routes, to consigned and in-transit stocks for the several states, 'which would have illuminated the situation in the several trade areas where the competitive set-ups differed widely,' were withheld from purchasers. The court concluded \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 597]\n\u00a0\n that, by collecting and circulating only among themselves that information, defendants obtained an unfair advantage with respect to purchasers and effected an unreasonable restraint.\n The court took the view that the statistics relating to total production, total deliveries, and calculable stocks, which defendants did make available, could have had only limited significance for the individual purchaser and were even likely to mislead him. Such information reflected only the general situation for the country as a whole and for all refiners. Defendants challenge this criticism and emphasize the value of the information they gave. And with respect to the statistics not disseminated, they say that it did not appear how buyers were prejudiced and that the sole reason that the information was not published was 'because the refiners had no reason to believe that the buyers wanted it.' We cannot say, however, that the finding of the trial court, in connection with its exhaustive examination of conditions in the trade, is without adequate support. We shall presently consider the criticism from a legal standpoint of the breadth of the provision in the decree relating to the duty of dissemination.\n Fourth. The application of the Anti-Trust Act and the provisions of the decree.-The restrictions imposed by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 U.S. C.A.  1-7, 15 note) are not mechanical or artificial. We have repeatedly said that they set up the essential standard of reasonableness. Standard Oil Company v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L. R.A.(N.S.) 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734; United Stat  v. American Tobacco Company, \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S.Ct. 632. They are aimed at contractsand combinations which 'by reason of intent or the inherent nature of the contemplated acts, prejudice the public interests by unduly restricting competition or unduly obstructing the course of trade.' Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 376\n, 33 S.Ct. 780, 781; United States v. American Linseed Oil Company, \n262 \nU.S. 371, 388\n, 389 S., 43 S.Ct. 607. Designed to frustrate unreasonable \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 598]\n\u00a0\n restraints, they do not prevent the adoption of reasonable means to protect interstate commerce from destructive or injurious practices and to promote competition upon a sound basis. Voluntary action to end abuses and to foster fair competitive opportunities in the public interest may be more effective than legal processes. And co-operative endeavor may appropriately have wider objectives than merely the removal of evils which are infractions of positive law. Nor does the fact that the correction of abuses may tend to stabilize a business, or to produce fairer price levels, require that abuses should go uncorrected or that an effort to correct them should for that reason alone be stamped as an unreasonable restraint of trade. Accordingly we have held that a co-operative enterprise otherwise free from objection, which carries with it no monopolistic menace, is not to be condemned as an undue restraint merely because it may effect a change in market conditions where the change would be in mitigation of recognized evils and would not impair, but rather foster, fair competitive opportunities. Appalachian Coals v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344, 373\n, 374 S., 53 S.Ct. 471. Further, the dissemination of information is normally an aid to commerce. As free competition means a free and open market among both buyers and sellers, competition does not become less free merely because of the distribution of knowledge of the essential factors entering into commercial transactions. The natural effect of the acquisition of the wider and more scientific knowledge of business conditions on the minds of those engaged in commerce, and the consequent stabilizing of production and price, cannot be said to be an unreasonable restraint or in any respect unlawful. Maple Flooring Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 563, 582\n, 583 S., 45 S.Ct. 578. In that case, we decided that trade associations which openly and fairly gather and disseminate information as to the cost of their \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 599]\n\u00a0\n product, the volume of production, the actual price which the product has brought in past transactions, stocks of merchandise on hand, approximate costs of transportation, without reaching or attempting to reach an agreement or concerted action with respect to prices or production or restraining competition, do not fall under the interdiction of the Act. Id ., \n268 U.S. 563\n, at page 586, 45 S.Ct. 578. See, also, Cement Manufacturers' Protective Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 588, 604\n, 606 S., 45 S.Ct. 586.\n The freedom of concerted action to improve conditions has an obvious limitation. The end does not justify illegal means. The endeavor to put a stop to illicit practices must not itself become illicit. As the statute draws the line at unreasonable restraints, a co-operative endeavor which transgresses that line cannot justify itself by pointing to evils afflicting the industry or to a laudable purpose to remove them. The decisions on which defendants rely emphasize this limitation. In Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231\n, 38 S.Ct. 242, the Court found the assailed rule to be a reasonable regulation in a limited field. In the case of Appalachian Coals v. U.S., supra, \n288 U.S. 344\n, at page 375, 53 S.Ct. 471, the Court found that abundant competitive opportunities would exist in all markets where defendants' coal was sold, and that nothing had been shown to warrant the conclusion that defendants' plan w uld have an injurious effect upon competition in those markets. In Standard Oil Company v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 163\n, 51 S.Ct. 421, relating to contracts concerning patents for cracking processes in producing gasoline, an examination of the transactions involved led to the conclusion 'that no monopoly of any kind, or restraint of interstate commerce' had been effected 'either by means of the contractsor in some other way.' Id. \n283 U.S. 163\n, at page 179, 51 S.Ct. 421, 427. And, while the collection and dissemination of trade statistics are in themselves permissible and may be a useful adjunct of \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 600]\n\u00a0\n fair commerce, a combination to gather and supply information as a part of a plan to impose unwarrantable restrictions, as, for example, to curtail production and raise prices, has been condemned. American Column Company v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 377, 411\n, 412 S., 42 S.Ct. 114, 21 A.L. R. 1093; United States v. Linseed Oil Company, supra; Maple Flooring Association v. United States, supra, \n268 U.S. 563\n, at pages 584, 585, 45 S. Ct. 578.\n We have said that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, as a charter of freedom, has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions. It does not go into detailed definitions. Thus in applying its broad prohibitions, each case demands a close scrutiny of its own facts. Questions of reasonableness are necessarily questions of relation and degree. In the instant case, a fact of outstanding importance is the relative position of defendants in the sugar industry. We have noted that the fifteen refiners, represented in the Institute, refine practically all the imported raw sugar processed in this country. They supply from 70to 80 per cent. of the sugar consumed. Their refineries are in the East, South, and West, and their agreements and concerted action have a direct effect upon the entire sugar trade. While their product competes with beet sugar and 'offshore' sugar, the maintenance of fair competition between the defendants themselves in the sale of domestic refined sugar is manifestly of serious public concern. Another outstanding fact is that defendants' product is a thoroughly standarized commodity. In their competition, price, rather than brand, is generally the vital consideration. The question of unreasonable restraint of competition thus relates in the main to competition in prices, terms and conditions of sales. The fact that, because sugar is a standardized commodity, there is a strong tendency to uniformity of price, makes it the more important that such opportunities as may exist for fair competition should not be impaired. \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 601]\n\u00a0\n Defendants point to the abuses which existed before they formed the Institute, and to their remedial efforts. But the controversy that emerges is not as to the abuses which admittedly existed, but whether defendants' agreement and requirements went too far and imposed unreasonable restraints. After a hearing of extraordinary length, in which no pertinent fact was permitted to escape consideration, the trial court subjected the evidence to a thorough and acute analysis which has left but slight room for debate over matters of fact. Our examination of the record discloses no reason for overruling the court's findings in any matter essential to our decision.\n In determining the relief to be afforded, appropriate regard should be had to the special and historic practice of the sugar industry. The restraints, found to be unreasonable, were the offspring of the basic agreement. The vice in that agreement was not in the mere open announcement of prices and terms in accordance with the custom of the trade. That practice which had grown out of the special character of the industry did not restrain competition. The trial court did not hold that practice to be illegal and we see no reason for condemning it. The unreasonable restraints which defendants imposed lay not in advance announcements, but in the  eps taken to secure adherence, without deviation, to prices and terms thus announced. It was that concerted undertaking which cut off opportunities for variation in the course of competition however fair and appropriate they might be. But, in ending that restraint, the beneficial and curative agency of publicity should not be unnecessarily hampered. The trial court left defendants free to provide for immediate publicity as to prices and terms in all closed transactions. We think that a limitation to that sort of publicity fails to take proper account of the practice of the trade in selling on 'moves,' as already de- \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 602]\n\u00a0\n scribed, a practice in accordance with which the court found that 'the great bulk of sugar always was and is purchased.' That custom involves advance announcements, and it does not appear that arrangements merely to circulate or relay such announcements threaten competitive opportunities. On the other hand, such provision for publicity may be helpful in promoting fair competition. If the requirement that there must be adherence to prices and terms openly announced in advance is abrogated and the restraints which followed that requirement are removed, the just interests of competition will be sefeguarded and the trade will still be left with whatever advantage may be incidental to its established practice.\n The decree.-The court below did not dissolve the Institute. The practices which had been found to constitute unreasonable restraints were comprehensively enjoined. The injunction restrains defendants 'individually and collectively, in connection with the sale, marketing, shipment, transportation, storage, distribution or delivery of refined sugar,' from engaging with one another or with any competitor through any 'program' in any of the activities separately described. The decree defines 'program' as 'any agreement, understanding or concerted action, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any rule, policy or code provision or interpretation, concertedly adopted or maintained.'\n Then follow forty-five specifications of prohibited action. As to seventeen of these paragraphs, defendants have withdrawn their assignments of error.\n Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the specifications enjoin the carrying out of the open price plan so far as it seeks to compel uniform terms, regardless of circumstances, and \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 603]\n\u00a0\n an adherence to prices, terms, etc., announced in advance. These paragraphs cover any agreement or concerted action in\n'1. Effectuating any general plan to give the same terms, conditions, or freight applications to customers, regardless of the varying circumstances of particular transactions or classes of transactions or regardless of the varying situation of particular refiners, distributors or customers or classes thereof;\n\n'2. Selling only upon or adhering to prices, terms, conditions or freight applications announced, reported or relayed in advance of sale or refraining from deviating therefrom.'\n\n In view of those provisions, and of the other forty specified restrictions, we think that paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 with respect to the reporting or relaying of information as to current or future prices should be eliminated. These paragraphs are as follows:\n'3. Effectuating any system for or systematically reporting to or among one another or competitors or to a common agency, information as to current or future prices, terms, conditions, or freight applications, or lists or schedules of the same;\n\n'4. Relaying by or through The Sugar Institute, Inc., or any other common agency, information as to current or future prices, terms, conditions or freight applications or any list or schedule of the same;\n\n'5. Giving any prior notice of any change or contemplated change in prices, terms, conditions or freight applications, or relaying, reporting or announcing any such change in advance thereof.'\n\n Such reporting or relaying, as we have said, permits voluntary price announcements by individual refiners, in accordance ith trade usage, to be circulated, and sub- \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 604]\n\u00a0\n ject to the restrictions imposed by the decree does not appear to involve any unreasonable restraint of competition.\n Paragraph 7 relates to the collection and dissemination of statistical information, as follows:\n'7. Effectuating any system of gathering and\/or disseminating statistical information regarding melt, sales, deliveries, stocks on hand, stocks on consignment, stocks in transit, volume of sugar moved by differential or other particular routes or types of routes, new business or any other statistical information of a similar character, wherever and to the extent that said information is not made, or is not readily, fully and fairly available to the purchasing and distributing trade.'\n\n This provision was based upon the finding that 'perfect competition and defendants' professed policy of fostering such competition require that the purchasing trade as well as the sellers have the full, detailed information which defendants withheld.' That ruling has appropriate reference to the statistical data which are specified in paragraph 7 and to the withholding of which we have referred. In those data the purchasing and distributing trade have a legitimate interest. But it does not follow that the purchasing and distributing trade have such an interest in every detail of information which may be received by the Institute. Information may be received in relation to the affairs of refiners which may rightly be treated as having a confidential character and in which distributors and purchasers have no proper interest. To require, under the penalties of disobedience of the injunction, the dissemination of everything that the Institute may learn might well prejudice rather than serve the interests of fair competition and obstruct the useful and entirely lawful activities of the refiners.\n In this view we think that the clause in paragraph 7 'or any other statistical information of a similar \n\n[297 U.S. 553, 605]\n\u00a0\n character' should be eliminated. The preceding specifications as to melt, sales, deliveries, stocks on hand, on consignment, or in transit, and as to transportation and new business, appear to be adequate. The words 'of a similar character' have no clearly defined meaning and would place the defendants under an equivocal restriction which may do more harm than good. With the removal of that clause and the placing of the word 'and' before the words 'new business,' paragraph seven is approved.\n Following the provisions for injunction, the decree properly provides that jurisdiction is retained for the purpose of 'enforcing, enlarging or modifying' its terms. It is further provided that the injunction is without prejudice to application by any party for modification in order to permit the adoption of any 'program' that may be permissible under 'the National Industrial Recovery Act' of June 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 195), or the 'Emergency Farm Relief Act' of May 12, 1933 (48 Stat. 31) or 'any other present or future statutes of the United States.' This subdivision of the decree should be modified so as to refer simply to 'any applicable Act of Congress.'\n The decree is modified in the particulars above stated and, as thus modified, is affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration and decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The court states: 'The testimony is transcribed in over 10,000 typewritten pages; more than 900 exhibits covering many thousands of pages were introduced in evidence.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The 'basis price' is the price quoted at so much per pound per one hundred pound bag of 'fine granulated' or 'granulated' sugar. Contracts are closed with reference to this price but the purchaser has the option at stipulated differentials to specify for delivery an assortment of grades and packages. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] It appears that these five refiners accounted for 25.45 per cent. of all sugar produced by defendants; in 1931, for 28.54 per cent. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The American Sugar Refining Company, which, in 1927, had 25.06 per cent. of all sugar produced by defendants. \n\n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTENNESSEE PUB.

Answers and motions to dismiss were filed by bondholders. Three successive plans of reorganization were submitted and opposed. Several hearings were had. It appears that for more than two years prior to this proceeding, the affairs of the debtor had been in charge of a receiver appointed by the District Court upon a creditors' bill. An appraisal of the debtor's property showed assets worth about $295, 000. Outstanding bonds, secured by mortgage, were in default and amounted with interest to approximately $900,000. There were unsecured claims of about $300,000.\n We shall not attempt to state the many details of the various plans. It may be said in a general way that the first plan, and the second presented 'as a supplement to, or alternate of,' the first, contemplated an appraisal of the property, the determination of the value of the bonds, and the issue of new bonds and the distribution of the proceeds of their sale, after payment of costs, expenses and preferred claims, among the secured and unsecured creditors and stockholders. By an amendment the debtor offered to pay in cash the amount of the appraised value of the property as it might be judicially determined, or to pay the 'actual cash value of all valid interests, claims or liens' as fixed by the court. The third plan looked to \n\n[299 U.S. 18, 21]\n\u00a0\n the retention of the property by the debtor subject to the lien of the bonds scaled to 80 per cent. of their face value, or, in the absence of assent, to an amount found by the court to be due. Provision was also made for the issue of preferred stock.\n In his final opinion, upon the third plan, the District Judge said that it would 'manifestly be unjust to the bondholders' to undo what had been done in the equity case; that 'the validity and amount of the bonds outstanding' had been established in that case upon the report of the standing master, to which the debtor had not excepted; and that it was admitted that the debtor was 'notoriously insolvent.'\n The District Judge was unable to see how the bondholders could realize the value of their bonds, or how that value could be ascertained 'except by a public sale' of the mortgaged property. He thought that the effect of the last plan was to disregard what had been done in the equity suit and to delay a final administration of the debtor's estate indefinitely. He found that none of the bondholders were willing to adopt the plan, and that more than two- thirds of the bondholders and more than 50 per cent. of the unsecured creditors had affirmatively declined to accept it. He expressed the view that in such circumstances the adoption of the plan would deprive the secured creditors of their constitutional rights. While again ruling that the petition for reorganization was filed in 'good faith,' he saw no alternative 'except to dismiss the petition and let the property be sold in the equity case.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals considered that the District Judge, in passing upon the issue of good faith, was guided mainly by a consideration of the debtor's honesty of purpose. The court believed that more was required; that the statute had in view the submission of a practicable plan with a reasonable prospect for the rehabilita- \n\n[299 U.S. 18, 22]\n\u00a0\n tion of the debtor, and that hence in the finding of good faith by the District Judge there was an erroneous application of the law. Despite that, the court recognized that the decree of the District Court should still be affirmed if right, however erroneous might be any given conclusion of law.\n Although reaching the conclusion that the plan of reorganization was not a workable one and failed to meet the statutory test, the Court of Appeals proceeded to consider the constitutionality of subsection (b)(5) and held it invalid. This ruling was premature. The constitutional question was not necessarily presented, as with such a plan no case had been made for the application of subsection (b)(5). It is a familiar rule that the court will not anticipate the decision of a constitutional question upon a record which does not appropriately present it. Liverpool, N.Y. & P.S.S. Co. v. Commissioners, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 39\n, 5 S.Ct. 352; Cincinnati v. Vester, \n281 \nU.S. 439, 448\n, 449 S., 50 S.Ct. 360, 363; Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 463\n, 464 S., 51 S.Ct. 522, 529.\n Nor do we need to inquire as to the precise limits of the concept of 'good faith' as required by section 77B. Whatever these limits may be, the statute clearly contemplates the submission of a plan of reorganization which admits of being confirmed as 'fair and equitable' and as 'feasible.' However honest in its efforts the debtor may be, and however sincere its motives, the District Court is not bound to clog its docket with visionary or impracticable schemes for resuscitation. Subsection (f) of section 77B ( 11 U.S.C.A.  207(f) provides for the confirmation of a plan only if the District Judge is satisfied 'that (1) it is fair and equitable and does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class of creditors or stockholders, and is feasible.' These are prime conditions. Unless the District Judge finds that the plan has these qualities, he need go no further. Unless he so finds, he has no authority to proceed. There is no occasion for the District Judge to consider the con- \n\n[299 U.S. 18, 23]\n\u00a0\n stitutional validity of the application of the clauses of subsection (b)(5) if the debtor's proposal is not found to be 'fair' and 'feasible.' It was the duty of the District Judge in this instance to consider the debtor's proposal in that aspect. He did not find that proposal to be fair and feasible. On the contrary, he deemed it to be unjust to the bondholders to override what had been accomplished in the equity case. He found that it was impracticable to determine the value of their bonds except by a public sale, and, in view of the financial condition of the debtor, he deemed a sale of its property to be 'inevitable.' And along with these considerations, the proposal encountered what he described as the almost unanimous opposition of the secured creditors and the refusal of assent by a majority of the general creditors. Where the debtor's plan of reorganization is not confirmed, the District Judge is authorized to dismiss the proceeding. Subsection (c)(8)  77B (11 U.S.C.A.  207(c)(8).\n The question before the Circuit Court of Appeals was whether, upon the record, the District Court erred in refusing to confirm the plans and in dismissing the proceeding. The Court of Appeals examined the debtor's last proposal as its ultimate effort to repel attack upon the feasibility of reorganization. The court found that the plan was not understandable in all of its phases, even after diligent effort 'to separate argument from concrete proposals' and 'to reconcile apparently conflicting clauses.' The provisions for a bond issue and for classes of preferred stock, out of the proceeds of which unsecured creditors and preferred stockholders were to be compensated, the court found to be 'wholly incomprehensible.' Certainly the District Court was not bound to consider such a plan as fair and feasible, or, in view of the situation which the record disclosed, to continue the proceeding. \n\n[299 U.S. 18, 24]\n\u00a0\n That was an entirely adequate ground for sustaining the decree of the District Court without attempting to determine the constitutional validity of subsection (b)(5). Quite apart from that question, upon which we express no opinion, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming that of the District Court, should in turn be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provision is as follows:\n'(b) A plan of reorganization within the meaning of this section ... (5) shall provide in respect of each class of creditors of which less than two thirds in amount shall accept such plan (unless the claims of such class of creditors will not be affected by the plan, or the plan makes provision for the payment of their claims in cash in full), provide adequate protection for the realization by them of the value of their interests, claims, or liens, if the property affected by such interests, claims, or liens is dealt with by the plan, either as provided in the plan ( a) by the transfer or sale of such property subject to such interests, claims, or liens, or by the retention of such property by the debtor subject to such interests, claims, or liens, or (b) by a sale free of such interests, claims, or liens at not less than a fair upset price and the transfer of such interests, claims, or liens to the proceeds of such sale; or (c) by appraisal and payment either in cash of the value either of such interests, claims, or liens, or, at the objecting creditors' election, of the securities allotted to such interests, claims, or liens under the plan, if any shall be so allotted; or (d) by such method as will in the opinion of the judge, under and consistent with the circumstances of the particular case, equitably and fairly provide such protection.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTERMINAL WAREHOUSE CO. v. PENNSYLVANIA R. CO.(1936)\nNo. 351\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 500, 501]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas Raeburn White, of Philadelphia, Pa., and J. J. Hickey, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 500, 503]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Hamp on Barnes, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent Pennsylvania R. Co.\n Mr. Robert T. McCracken, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent, Merchants Warehouse Co.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this action under the Anti-Trust Acts (15 U.S.C.  1, 15 (15 U.S. C.A.  1, 15)) for the recovery of treble damages, the Terminal Warehouse Company, petitioner in this court, accuses a competitor, the Merchants Warehouse Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, an interstate com- \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 504]\n\u00a0\n mon carrier, of an unlawful combination in restraint of trade and commerce.\n The business of Merchants Warehouse Company, which for brevity will be spoken of as Merchants, began in January, 1887. Its site was the city of Philadelphia. At the beginning there were two warehouses, both in convenient proximity to the Pennsylvania's tracks and terminals. Other buildings were added from time to time by purchase or by lease to serve other sections of the city. From the outset Merchants had contracts with Pennsylvania for privileges and payments special to itself. These are the contracts of which Terminal complains. They were renewed as they ran out from 1887 to 1931; a separate contract being made with reference to each building. For present purposes a summary of one contract will serve as a summary of all, though they differ in particulars. For illustration we choose the contract of January 25, 1917, which has to do with the warehouse at Water and Chestnut streets. By this contract Pennsylvania agrees to maintain tracks adjacent to the warehouse and to make payments at stipulated rates for services rendered by the warehouse in the receipt and delivery of freight. While the contract is in force, there is to be no allowance for such services to any other warehouse company in the city of Philadelphia. In return Merchants agrees to give a preference to Pennsylvania over other lines in the use of its facilities; to load and unload freight promptly and efficiently; to collect charges due for incoming freight; and to be responsible to the railroad company therefor.\n No secret was made of the existence of this contract or of any of the others. On the contrary, the substance of the whole arrangement was set forth in the tariffs of the railroad filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and open to the public. Pennsylvania there showed that it had designated the warehouses of Merchants as stations for the receipt and delivery of freight. It also \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 505]\n\u00a0\n showed the amount of the payments and allowances to be made to Merchants for services in handling freight at the stations so designated. For many years the practice went unchallenged by any agency of government. The assumption was that the warehouses, though not owned by Pennsylvania, were, none the less, public freight stations supplied by a contractor (United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n231 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 34 S.Ct. 75), and that the railroad in making payments or allowances for the handling of the freight was paying for transportation services rendered by an agent. Decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission bring this out in clear relief. Keystone Warehouse Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 53 I.C.C. 335; Keystone Elevator & Warehouse Co. v. Director General, 73 I.C.C. 273, 274; McCormick Warehouse Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 95 I.C.C. 301. Those cases stood unquestioned until 1928, when one of them (McCormick Warehouse Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra) was reheard and overruled (148 I.C.C. 299); earlier decisions to the same effect falling along with it. The conclusion was then announced that a warehouse company doing business under such a contract was a consignor or consignee, acting on its own behalf and not as agent for the carrier. With this change in its relation, discriminatory payments or allowance became forbidden and unlawful. 49 U.S. C.  3(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  3(1).\n Terminal, a rival warehouse, organized in 1904, was quick to occupy the vantage ground left open by that ruling. It laid b fore the Interstate Commerce Commission a complaint charging Pennsylvania with unjust discrimination in the practices described. It asked that a restraining order protect it for the future, and that there be an award of reparation for losses suffered in the past. There were separate complaints as to the acts of other railroads (the Baltimore & Ohio and the Reading), which had terminal arrangements with warehouses of their own \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 506]\n\u00a0\n selection. Neither of these other roads had given a preference to Merchants, and none of the three was acting in concert with any other. The Commission, adhering to its ruling in the McCormick Warehouse Case, held that the designated warehouses were in truth not public freight stations, however the carriers might style them. From this it followed that allowances and special privileges accorded on the footing of an agency relation would have to be abandoned. Gallagher v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 160 I.C.C. 563. The railroads were required to cancel any tariff provisions whereby 'the facilities of the contract warehouses' were made 'a part of the respective station facilities' of the lines affected by the order. They were required to 'cease and desist' from publishing or making the discriminatory privileges and allowances growing out of the attempt to treat the warehouse companies as agents. On the other hand, the Commission refused an award of reparation. 'The evidence is far too vague and indefinite to warrant the canclusion that complainants have suffered actual pecuniary loss attributable directly to the alleged unlawful practices.'\n The carriers, together with Merchants and other warehouse companies interveners in the proceeding, brought suit in a federal court (three judges sitting) to vacate the order of the Commission. The bills of complaint were dismissed, one judge dissenting. Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. U.S. (D.C.) 44 F. (2d) 379. Upon appeal to this court the decree was affirmed. Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501\n, 51 S.Ct. 505. The opinion there rendered is so exact in its description of the nature and effect of the unlawful practices as to make elaboration useless now. In particular, the court points out that a warehouse designated as a station was in a position to receive package freight in less than carload lots, and ship it at carload rates without charge to the customer for assembling the packages and loading them, this by reason of the fact that the warehouse had been \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 507]\n\u00a0\n paid by the railroad for doing that very work. To that extent it could afford to underbid competitors. For the same reason it had a position of superiority over against its rivals in unloading carload lots, for it could distribute and reship in packages at the expense of the carrier. This advantage as to package freight, if permitted to continue, would have taken the life out of rules designed to limit the character of transportation services. By rule 23 of the Consolidated Freight Classification a carrier may not distribute carloads of freight in less than carload lots, nor assemble smaller lots into carloads. \n283 U.S. 501\n, at page 510, 51 S.Ct. 505. Thus the opinion makes it clear that the whole system of warehouse stations, with its payments and allowances, including the incidental saving of demurrage, had been built upon a false foundation. Adherence to the statute called for its suppression.\n We have seen that Terminal asked for reparation as well as for a restraining order at the hands of the Commission. There is no doubt that the Commission had jurisdiction in response to that request to make an award against the railroad for damages suffered by the complainant as a result of the unlawful practices. 49 U.S.C.  8, 9, 16(1, 2), 49 U.S.C.A .  8, 9, 16(1, 2); Interstate Commerce Commission v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 385\n, 53 S.Ct. 607; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Ohio Valley Tie Co., \n242 \nU.S. 288\n, 37 S.Ct. 120; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. W. F.

International Coal Mining Co., \n230 \nU.S. 184\n, 33 S.Ct. 893, Ann.Cas.1915A, 315. The Commission found, however, that no damages had been proved, and its ruling as to that was final, not subject to review by this court or any other. Interstate Commerce Commission v. United States, supra, \n289 U.S. 385\n, at page 388, 53 S.Ct. 607; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Brady, \n288 \nU.S. 448\n, 53 S.Ct. 411; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 235\n, 51 S.Ct. 429; Alton R. Co. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 229\n, 53 S.Ct. 124; Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S.Ct. 761. True, the complainant might have \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 508]\n\u00a0\n confined itself to a request for a restraining order, and after thus invalidating the preference have asked a court for reparation. 49 U.S.C.  9, 49 U.S.C.A.  9. It had a choice, in other words, between a remedy at the hands of the Commission and a remedy by suit, but by express provision of the statute it could not have them both. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Brady, supra. Reparation under the Commerce Act was thus permanently barred by the ruling of the Commission as against the offending carrier. The situation was altogether different, however, in respect of the liability of Merchants and other aiders and abettors. As to wrongdoers other than the carrier, the complainant had not asked the Commission to fix the quantum of the damages; thus relieving us of the duty to inquire whether jurisdiction would have existed if such relief had been demanded. 49 U.S.C.  9, 16(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  9, 16(1), and compare 49 U.S.C.  42, 49 U.S.C.A.  42. Merchants would not have been affected by an award of reparation if the Commission had found the evidence sufficient for that relief, and it gains nothing from the fact that reparation was refused. In saying this we are not unmindful that it intervened in the proceeding. It was interested in the event, for it would be harmed by a restraining order. 49 U.S.C.  42, 49 U.S.C.A.  42. Intervention, though permitted, did not broaden the complaint nor add to the range of enumerated powers. Accordingly, the framers of the statute were careful to provide that aiders and abettors should not go unwhipped of justice. In a suit under the Commerce Act, all persons soliciting or procuring the allowance of a forbidden preference were to be liable, jointly or severally, to make good the damage suffered. 49 U.S.C.  10(4), 49 U.S.C.A.  10(4).1 Cf. 49 U.S.C .  41(3), 49 U.S.C.A.  41(3). Here was \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 509]\n\u00a0\n an ample remedy to reach a guilty participant in an unlawful discrimination, whether reparation against the carrier had been granted or refused.\n Petitioner, not satisfied to proceed under the Commerce Act, put that remedy aside and brought suit under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A .  1-7, 15 note, and Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730) hoping by that maneuver to charge both carrier and warehouse, and to charge them with treble damages. Every act of wrongdoing proved in the new suit to have been committed by the defendants was proved against them also (with unsubstantial exceptions) in the case before the Commission. Now, as before, the head and front of their offending is the use of the warehouses as stations for the carrier with the allowances and privileges, such as exemption from demurrage, growing out of that relation. What is true of the offense is true also of its consequences. There has been no proof of any loss that would not be provable in equal measure in proceedings under the Commerce Act upon a claim for reparation. Interstate Commerce Commission v. United States, supra; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Ohio Valley Tie Co., supra. Terminal does not show that there was a conspiracy to establish a monopoly either \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 510]\n\u00a0\n of transportation by Pennsylvania or of storage by Merchants, much less that a monopoly was actually attained. There was no monopoly of transportation, for the statistics make it plain that the competing lines in Philadelphia had a large percentage of the business of carrying storage freight. Moreover, Terminal is not here as the representative of the railroads, and may not vindicate their grievances, if grievances there are. More important is the consideration whether there has been a monopoly of storage. There are many warehouses in Philadelphia for the storage of railroad freight. Neither Merchants nor any other company has been able to engross the business or has even attempted to engross it. During the years of the unlawful practices, Merchants' business declined proportionately to the whole, and Terminal's increased, as did also that of other warehouses, so far as the record supplies us with the relevant statistics. Indeed, petitioner does not even claim that, by reason of the defendants' acts, it failed to get business that would otherwise have come to it. If there was any claim for such damages at the beginning, it was explicitly renounced. What petitioner contends and has contended for is this and nothing more, that to hold and attract customers it had to keep its charges down below the normal rate, diminishing its profit to the extent of the reduction. In a word, its only damages are those resulting, in its view, from the allowances for loading and unloading or like discriminatory acts, and not from any conspiracy transcending these particulars, a conspiracy of which allowances and privileges are a symptom or an incident.\n Upon the basis of that evidence, the trial judge left it to the jury to say whether Terminal was a sufferer from an unlawful combination in restraint of trade and commerce. The jury found a verdict for $136,125 against both defendants. This verdict was trebled by the court, \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 511]\n\u00a0\n with the addition of a counsel fee ($27,000); the whole judgment thus amounting to $437,338.81. There was an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit where the judgment was reversed. The ground of the reversal was that the decision of the Commission refusing reparation was a bar to any claim for damages against either of the defendants in a suit under the antitrust laws as well as under the Commerce Act. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Terminal Warehouse Co., 78 F.(2d) 591. This court (\n296 \nU.S. 560\n, 56 S.Ct. 137) granted a writ of certiorari to determine the scope and operation of important acts of Congress.\n The order of the Commission denying reparation, though it be assumed to be conclusive evidence in favor of the carrier, is plainly not such evidence for the carrier's confederate. We think it better to rest our judgment on ground applicable to both defendants. Whether such grounds exist is the question next in order.\n First. Discriminatory privileges and payments given by a carrier to a consignor or consignee are unavailing without more to make out a combination in restraint of trade or commerce within the meaning of the anti-trust laws. To lead to that result, the privileges or payments must be the symptoms or incidents of an enveloping conspiracy with its own illegal ends. In the absence of such a showing, a sufferer from discriminatory charges and allowances has his remedy under the Commerce Act for any damage to his business, and that remedy is exclusive against all the parties to the wrong.\n Two cases in this court, though not indeed decisive, are apposite and helpful. The first, Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co., \n260 \nU.S. 156\n, 43 S.Ct. 47, was a suit under the anti-trust laws against railway companies and others who were charged to have combined in establishing uniform rates and thus destroying competition, all to the plaintiff's damage. True, the rates had been approved after complaint to the Commission, but this was not \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 512]\n\u00a0\n enough, or Keogh so contended. He was entitled in his view to the benefit of competitive rates, quite apart from any finding that the rates established by concerted action were reasonable in amount and without discriminatory effect. In upholding a dismissal of the suit, the court called attention to the provisions of the Commerce Act whereby a remedy in damages was given for rates illegally exacted. 'If the conspiracy here complained of had resulted in rates which the Commission found to be illegal because unreasonably high or discriminatory, the full amount of the damages sustained, whatever their nature, would have been recoverable in such proceedings. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Ohio Valley Tie Co., \n242 \nU.S. 288\n, 37 S.Ct. 120. Can it be that Congress intended to provide the shipper, from whom illegal rates have been exacted, with an additional remedy under the Anti-Trust Act? See Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co. (C.C.) 162 F. 354. And if no remedy under the anti-trust law is given where the injury results from the fixing of rates which are illegal, because too high or discriminatory, may it be assumed that Congress intended to give such a remedy where, as here, the rates complained of have been found by the Commission to be legal and while in force had to be collected by the carrier?' \n260 U.S. 156\n, at page 162, 43 S.Ct. 47, 49. These queries were coupled with a warning of the practical inconvenience attendant on any answer different from the one that they suggest. 'If a shipper could recover under section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act ( 15 U.S.C.A.  15 note) for damages resulting from the exaction of a rate higher than that which would otherwise have prevailed, the amount recovered might, like a rebate, operate to give him a preference over his trade competitors.' \n260 U.S. 156\n, at page 163, 43 S.Ct. 47, 50.\n A second case pointing the same way is United States Navigation Co., Inc. v. Cunard Steamship Co., Ltd., \n284 \nU.S. 474\n, 52 S.Ct. 247. The suit was for an injunction under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Clayton Act to restrain a group of \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 513]\n\u00a0\n steamship companies from continuing a conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce. The acts charged to be illegal fell within the express prohibitions of the Shipping Act of 1916 as amended, or were in effect, even if not in terms, a component part thereof. \n284 U.S. 474\n, at page 485, 52 S.Ct. 247; 46 U.S.C.  801, 812, 815, 816, 876 (46 U.S.C. A.  801, 812, 815, 816, 876). The decision was that the plaintiff must seek redress by application to the Shipping Board. True, the Anti-Trust Laws, since the enactment of the Clayton Act, have been explicit in providing that any one injured by an unlawful combination might have relief by injunction against threatened damage to his business. 15 U.S.C.  26 (15 U.S.C.A  26); Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, 41 S.Ct. 172, 16 A.L.R. 196; Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Association, \n274 \nU.S. 37\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 54 A.L.R. 791. To this there is an exception where the subject-matter of the complaint is a wrong within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, in which case an injunction, if granted, must be at the instance of the government. 15 U.S.C.  26 (15 U.S.C.A.  26); Central Transfer Co. v. Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, \n288 \nU.S. 469, 474\n, 53 S.Ct. 444. The exception does not apply, at all events in terms, to wrongs within the jurisdiction of any other board. Even so, the right to sue, however explicit on its face, was held to have been partially superseded in respect of private suitors by the adoption of the Shipping Act, which as to transactions within its range gave the only remedy available. The conclusion was reinforced by a reference to Keogh's Case and to the need for a uniformity difficult of attainment when jurisdiction is divided.\n What was said in these opinions is precisely applicable here. If a sufferer from the discriminatory acts of carriers by rail or by water may sue for an injunction under the Clayton Act without resort in the first instance to the regulatory commission, the unity of the system of regulation breaks down beyond repair.

On the other hand, if the regulatory commission has issued a 'cease and desist' order, an injunction under the Clayton Act is inappropriate and needless. 49 U.S.C.  16(7, 8, 12), 49 U.S.C.A.  16(7, 8, 12). The same considerations are applicable, and with undiminished force, where the suit under the Clayton Act is not for an injunction but for damages. There, too, a finding of undue discrimination by the regulatory board is a necessary preliminary to a suit against the carrier. See cases supra. Certain then it is that the Anti-Trust Laws are inapplicable in all their apparent breadth to carriers by rail or water. A consignor or consignee aggrieved by such a wrong must resort to the appropriate administrative agency, at least for many purposes. If he is remitted to the Commerce Act or the Shipping Act to cancel the illegal preference, may he pass over those acts and revert to the Clayton or the Sherman Act for the purpose of recovering damages? The Commerce Act like the Shipping Act embodies a remedial system that is complete and self- contained. It provides the means for ascertaining the existence of a preference, but it does not stop at that point. As already shown in this opinion, it gives a cause of action for damages not only against the carrier, but also against shippers and consignees who have incited or abetted. For the wrongs that it denounces it prescribes a fitting remedy which, we think, was meant to be exclusive. If another remedy is sought under cover of another statute, there must be a showing of another wrong, not canceled or redressed by the recovery of damages for the wrong explicitly denounced. The opinions of this court in their fair and \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 515]\n\u00a0\n natural extension point to that conclusion. Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co., supra; United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard Steamship Co., supra. The opinions of other federal courts point the same way with equal, if not greater, certainty. United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S.S. Co. (C.C.A.) 50 F.(2d) 83, 86, 89, r viewing the decisions; Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co. (C.C.) 162 F. 354, 363; United States v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co. (C.C.) 142 F. 176, 184, 185; Glenn Coal Co. v. Dickinson Fuel Co. (C.C.A.) 72 F.(2d) 885, 888. We follow these signposts to the goal they seem to mark.\n In thus holding, we do not intimate that never in any circumstances can a carrier become a party to a conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce with liability for treble damages. This has been made plain already. We enlarge on it for greater certainty. Wherein the case is now deficient will be made clearer by example. One may suppose a business of a manufacturer which has assumed the form and size of a monopoly, or, if not already at that stage, is well upon the road thereto. Cf. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 51\n, 61 S., 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A.( N.S.) 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734; United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S.Ct. 632; United States v. United States Steel Corp., \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 40 S.Ct. 293, 8 A.L.R. 1121; United States v. Swift & Co., \n286 \nU.S. 106, 116\n, 52 S.Ct. 460. One may add a situation in which a carrier has knowingly confederated with the owner to preserve such a business or foster it. Whatever liability grows out of that alliance is untouched by this decision. For present purposes we may assume that, if such a situation should develop, the carrier would make itself a participant in the monopoly which it had conspired to produce, though its only overt act was a discriminatory rate of carriage. Again, a group of manufacturers, whose business in combination would not amount to a monopoly, might unite among themselves to lay a burden upon commerce by concerted action as to prices. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S.Ct. 276; \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 516]\n\u00a0\n United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., \n262 \nU.S. 371\n, 43 S.Ct. 607; Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600\n, 34 S.Ct. 951, L.R.A.1915A, 788. If a carrier were to give a preference in furtherance of that conspiracy, it would become a participant therein, or so we may assume; the damages being measured, not merely by the consequences flowing from the preference, but by those flowing from the conspiracy in all its comprehensive unity.\n None of these assumptions affects the case at hand. For reasons already stated, there was no conspiracy to monopolize the storage business to the destruction of Terminal or of others similarly situated. There was no conspiracy to impose upon that business a burden of any kind, except to the extent that the enjoyment of a preference might increase the opportunities for profit of the warehouse so preferred. Of any combination more far-reaching, more inclusive in its aims, there is silence in the record after every reasonable inference has been drawn from its pages. On the contrary, the history of the relation between Pennsylvania and Merchants indicates strongly that the illegal discrimination, far from being a symptom of a larger combination, was the product of a mistake of law, which was shared for many years by the regulatory commission till the decision in McCormick's Case laid down another rule. The mistake does not relieve the carrier from liability for the concession of a privilege which has turned out to be forbidden. It serves, however, as a reminder that the liability must be kept within reasonable limits and that a preference innocent in purpose should not be magnified into a token of a circumambient conspiracy.\n We conclude that for Merchants as well as for Pennsylvania whatever liability was incurred through the forbidden discrimination was under the act to regulate commerce and not for treble damages.\n Second. The case having been submitted to the jury on the theory that, apart from the unlawful preference, \n\n[297 U.S. 500, 517]\n\u00a0\n there was evidence of a conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce, and the complaint having been framed on hat theory and no other, the suit should have been dismissed as to each of the defendants.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals reversing the judgment of the District Court is accordingly\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Inducing Unjust Discrimination; Penalty; Liability for Damages.

ANELICH(1936)\nNo. 667\nArgued: Decided: April 27, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 110, 111]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ralph S. Pierce, of Seattle, Wash., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 110, 115]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wilbur Zundel, of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case certiorari was granted, \n297 \nU.S. 701\n, 56 S.Ct. 573, because of the importance of the question, to review a determination of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington, 183 Wash. 467, 49 P.(2d) 3, that assumption of risk is not a defense to an action brought under the Jones Act (Merchant Marine Act, 1920,  33), 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C.  688 (46 U.S.C.A.  688), to recover damages for the injury and death of a seaman caused by a defective appliance, a part of the equipment of a fishing vessel on which he was employed.\n The injury occurred at sea, when respondent's intestate was engaged in hauling in, with a power winch, the purse line of a fishing net. During this operation the drums of the winch, as was customary, were kept in continuous revolution at a speed of about eighty revolutions per minute. The two ends of the purse line, whose function is to purse, or close, the net at the bottom, were reeved through blocks hanging from a davit at the side of the vessel, from which they ran respectively to the aft and forward drums of the winch. Decedent was stationed at the aft drum, where his duty, like that of the winchman at the forward drum, was to take several turns of his end of the purse line about the revolving drum and \n\n[298 U.S. 110, 116]\n\u00a0\n hold the line taut, so that the winch would haul it in, and to coil the line as it came off the drum. When the rings at the bottom of the net through which the purse line passes came to the surface of the water, a bridle, or strap, was passed around the net and rings and attached to block and tackle suspended from a boom of the vessel. The purse line is then customarily thrown off the drums, and the net is raised higher by taking several turns about the forward drum with the line from the block and tackle, which then carries a load of about a ton and a half, and hauling on it. It was at this stage of the operation that decedent was injured. The purse line had been removed from the forward drum, and several turns of the line from the block and tackle, which was supporting the net, had been taken around this drum, when, in some way which do  not clearly appear, the decedent's leg became entangled in the purse line, which was not clear of the aft drum. Before the winch could be stopped his leg was drawn onto the drum by the purse line, the bones were broken and the flesh lacerated. Septicemia ensued, from which he died.\n Power was transmitted to the winch by a countershaft connected by a chain gear drive with the main, or propeller, shaft. There were two methods for starting and stopping the winch. One was by the operation of a lever located between decks, near the engine, which controlled the clutch on the main shaft. The other was by a lever located above deck, on the starboard side of the winch frame, between the drums, by which the jaws of the clutch connecting with the chain drive of the winch could be engaged with the corresponding jaws of the clutch keyed onto the main shaft. Attached to the winch frame by a string was a forked piece of wood designed for use as a brace to hold the winch lever in a position which would cause the clutch to engage, and prevent is slipping \n\n[298 U.S. 110, 117]\n\u00a0\n or disengaging while the winch was in motion. When placed in position this brace extended from a cleat on the frame of the winch to the winch lever.\n It is respondent's contention that the clutch was so defective, through long wear, that it would not remain engaged without the use of the brace to hold it in position; that the presence of the brace in position at the moment of the accident so prevented or delayed use of the lever at the winch that it was necessary to use the lever below deck to disengage the clutch on the main shaft in order to stop the winch; and that the consequent delay, after the alarm was given, was the proximate cause of decedent's injury.\n The trial court refused petitioners' request to charge that voluntary assumption by decedent of the risk of injury by the unsafe appliance was a defense to the action, and denied their motion for a non-suit and for a directed verdict. It left it to the jury to say whether petitioners had negligently failed to provide decedent with a safe appliance with which to work, and whether such failure was the proximate cause of the injury and death. The state Supreme Court sustained the judgment of the trial court upon a verdict for respondent, holding that, in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, assumption of risk is not a defense in a suit under the Jones Act.\n We granted certiorari to review the ruling upon the assumption of risk, and not for the purpose of reexamining the evidence of negligence and probable cause. With respect to the latter, it suffices to say that, although the testimony was conflicting, there was evidence from which the jury could have found that the clutch controlled by the lever at the winch was negligently allowed to remain in a defective condition; that because of the defect it would not remain engaged and the winch drums would not turn continuously unless the lever controlling the clutch was \n\n[298 U.S. 110, 118]\n\u00a0\n held in position by the brace; that the use of the brace to prevent the worn clutch from slipping or disengaging rendered the winch defective, and unsafe to those required to work in its vicinity, and that the use of the brace, and the consequent delay in stopping the winch from the engine room, when the alarm was given, was the proximate cause of the injury and death. We do not discuss other questions of lesser moment including those growing out of the alleged negligent failure of petitioners to provide decedent with prompt and appropriate medical attention as a contributing cause of his death, but direct our attention to the question brought here for review, whether assumption of risk is a defense to suits under the Jones Act.\n Since the maritime law allowed no recovery for the wrongful death of a seaman, see Lindgren v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 38\n, 50 S.Ct. 207, respondent's asserted right of action is conferred by section 33 of the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C.  688 (46 U.S.C.A.  688), which gives to a seama injured in the course of his employment, at his election, a right of action for damages at law, with trial by jury, in which 'all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common- law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply.' In case of the death of the seaman, as a result of the injury, it similarly gives a right of action to his personal representatives in which 'all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable.'\n Section 1 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, 45 U. S.C.  51 (45 U.S.C.A.  51), thus incorporated in the Jones Act by reference, gives a right of recovery for the injury or death of an employee of a common carrier by rail, in interstate or foreign commerce, 'resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or \n\n[298 U.S. 110, 119]\n\u00a0\n insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its ... appliances, machinery ... or other equipment.' By section 3 of the Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  53 (45 U.S.C.A.  53), contributory negligence does not bar recovery, but is ground for apportionment of the damages between employer and employee, and by sections 3 and 4, 45 U.S.C.  53, 54 (45 U.S.C.A.  53, 54), it is provided that no employee shall be held to have been guilty of contributory negligence or 'to have assumed the risks of his employment in any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.'\n The Jones Act thus brings into the maritime law new rules of liability. The source from which these rules are drawn defines them but prescribes nothing as to their operation in the field to which they are transferred. 'In that field their strength and operation come altogether from their inclusion in the maritime law' by virtue of the Jones Act. The election for which it provides 'is between alternatives accorded by the maritime law as modified, and not between that law and some nonmaritime system.' Panama Railroad Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 388\n, 389 S., 44 S.Ct. 391, 394; and see Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372, 380\n, 381 S., 38 S.Ct. 501; Pacific S.S. Co. v. Peterson, \n278 \nU.S. 130\n, 49 S.Ct. 75, 76.\n In applying the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 U.S.C.A.  51- 59), in suits brought by railroad employees, it has been settled by numerous decisions of this court that assumption of risk is a defense in a suit brought to recover for injuries resulting from defective appliances, the use of which is not required by the Federal Safety Appliance Act (45 U. S.C.A.  1 et seq.), see Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492\n, 34 S.Ct. 635, L.R.A.1915C, 1, Ann.Cas.1915B, 475; Jacobs v. Southern R. Co., \n241 \nU.S. 229\n, 36 S.Ct. 588; Boldt v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n245 \nU.S. 441, 445\n, 38 S.Ct. 139. The fact that the statute deals with and extends a common-law form of liability, provides for its enforcement in common-law courts, and prescribes that certain common-law defenses, including assumption \n\n[298 U.S. 110, 120]\n\u00a0\n of risk, shall not be available in specified cases, led to the conclusion that such defenses, when not excluded by the terms of the statute, are impliedly authorized.\n But the Jones Act does not, by its own terms, or by those adopted by reference from the Employers' Liability Act, prescribe that assumption of risk shall be a defense to the liability imposed for injuries to seamen on navigable waters, or, apart from the specific references to the fellow servant and contributory negligence rules, purport to enlarge or modify the defenses available in maritime law to suits brought to recover for such injuries. In the absence of such a definite command the scope of the new rules of liability and the nature of the defenses to them must be ascertained by refe ence to their new setting in the admiralty system.\n While the maritime law before the enactment of the Jones Act permitted no recovery for injuries resulting in the death of a seaman, or generally for injuries resulting from the negligence of a fellow servant or the master,1 a seaman who fell sick or was injured in the course of his employment was entitled to 'maintenance and cure,' 'at least so long as the voyage was continued,' see Pacific Steamship Co. v. Peterson, supra, and to recover from vessel or owner indemnity for injuries due to unseaworthiness of the vessel or 'failure to supply and to keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship.' These propositions were laid down in answering certified questions in The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n, 23 S.Ct. 483, and they have often been cited with approval by this Court. See Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., supra, \n247 U.S. 372\n, 379, \n\n[298 U.S. 110, 121]\n\u00a0\n 380, 38 S.Ct. 501; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, \n259 \nU.S. 255, 259\n, 42 S.Ct. 475; Pacific Steamship Co. v. Peterson, supra, \n278 \nU.S. 130, 134\n, 49 S.Ct. 75; Lindgren v. United States, supra.\n In declaring in The Osceola, without qualification as to the assumption of risk, that the owner and vessel were liable to indemnify seamen for injuries caused by unseaworthiness of the vessel, and that unseaworthiness embraced defective appliances appurtenant to the ship, this Court adopted the pronouncements of many earlier cases in admiralty in which the rule was applied or recognized. \n2\n It was definitely applied by this Court in Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra; cf. Plamals v. S. S. Pinar Del Rio, \n277 \nU.S. 151, 155\n, 48 S.Ct. 457. \n\n[298 U.S. 110, 122]\n\u00a0\n Before the Jones Act contributory negligence was ground for mitigation of damages in suits brought by seamen to recover for injuries attributable to defective equipment. See The Wanderer (C.C.) 20 F. 140; Olson v. Flavel (D.C.) 34 F. 477, overruling Peterson v. The Chandos (D.C.) 4 F. 645; The Frank and Willie (D.C.) 45 F. 494; The Julia Fowler (D.C.) 49 F. 277; John A. Roebling's Sons Co. v. Erickson (C.C.A.) 261 F. 986, 987; Cricket S.S. Co. v.

But no American case appears to have recognized assumption of risk as a defense to such a suit. In numerous cases this defense was either denied or ignored in circumstances plainly calling for its application had it been available. Halverson v. Nisen, Fed.Cas.No.5,970, 3 Sawy. 562; The Edith Godden (D.C.) 23 F. 43; The Julia Fowler, supra; The Noddleburn (D.C.) 28 F. 855; Olson v. Flavel, supra; The A.

Parry, supra.\n The seaman assumes the risk normally incident to his perilous calling, see The Iroquois, \n194 \nU.S. 240, 243\n, 24 S.Ct. 640; Cricket S. S. Co. v. Parry, supra; but it has often been pointed out that the nature of his calling, the rigid discipline to which he is subject, and the practical difficulties of his avoiding exposure to risks of unseaworthiness and \n\n[298 U.S. 110, 123]\n\u00a0\n defective appliances, make such a defense, as distinguished from contributory negligence, see Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, supra, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 503\n, 34 S.Ct. 635, L.R.A.1915C, 1, Ann.Cas.1915B, 475, peculiarly inapplicable to suits by seamen to recover for the negligent failure to provide a seaworthy ship and safe appliances. See The Colusa, supra, 248 F. 21, 24, 25; Cricket S.S. Co. v. Parry, supra, 263 F. 523, 526; Grimberg v. Admiral Oriental S.S. Line (D.C.) 300 F. 619, 621; United States S.B.E.F. Corp. v. O'Shea, 55 App.D.C. 300, 5 F.(2d) 123, 125; States S.S. Co. v. Berglann (C.C.A.) 41 F.(2d) 456, 457.\n Like considerations, and others to be mentioned, require a like conclusion with respect to the modified and in some respects enlarged liability imported into the maritime law by the Jones Act. The legislation was remedial, for the benefit and protection of seamen who are peculiarly the wards of admiralty. Its purpose was to enlarge that protection, not to narrow it. Cf. Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., supra. Its provisions, like others of the Merchant Marine Act (41 Stat. 988), of which it is a part, are to be liberally construed to attain that end, see Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, \n287 \nU.S. 367, 375\n, 53 S.Ct. 173; Jamison v. Encarnacion, \n281 \nU.S. 635, 639\n, 50 S.Ct. 440; Alpha S.S. Corp. v. Cain, \n281 \nU.S. 642\n, 50 S.Ct. 443; Warner v. Goltra, \n293 \nU.S. 155, 157\n, 160 S., 55 S.Ct. 46, and are to be interpreted in harmony with the established doctrine of maritime law of which it is an integral part. The denial in the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 U.S.C.A.  51-59) of the defense of assumption of risk refers only to suits founded on the Federal Safety Appliance Act (45 U.S.C. A.  1 et seq.), applicable alone to railroads. It can raise no inference as to the availability of the defense in suits brought to recover for injuries to seamen. No provision of the Jones Act is inconsistent with the admiralty rule as to assumption of risk. The purpose and terms of the Act, and the nature of the juristic field in which it is to be applied, preclude the assumption that Congress intended, by its adoption, to modify that rule by implication. Such has been the conclusion \n\n[298 U.S. 110, 124]\n\u00a0\n reached generally by the lower federal courts, although not with entire unanimity. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158\n, 23 S.Ct. 483, the Court did not answer the certified question, whether the master is a fellow servant, since it concluded that in any event the owners were not liable generally for injuries resulting from negligence unless they were occasioned by unseaworthiness or defect in appliances appurtenant to the ship. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The seaman's right of indemnity for injuries caused by defective appliances or unseaworthiness seems to have been a development from his privilege to abandon a vessel improperly fitted out. The privilege was recognized in Dixon v. The Cyrus, Fed.Cas.No.3,930, 2 Pet.Adm. 407 (D.C.Pa ., 1789), where it was held that the law will imply an engagement to the mariners that 'the ship shall be furnished with all the necessary and customary requisites for navigation, or, as the term is, shall be found seaworthy.' This case was relied on in several early cases recognizing the seaman's right to consequential damages for injuries resulting from faulty equipment. Halverson v. Nisen, Fed.Cas.No.5,970, 3 Sawy. 562; The Noddleburn (D.C.) 28 F. 855, 856; The Lizzie Frank (D.C.) 31 F. 477; and see The Wenonah, Fed.Cas.No.17,412, 1 Hask. 606. The rule that unseaworthiness releases the seaman from his contract is of uncertain origin, but it is closely related to the master's obligation to owner and shipper that the vessel be well equipped and ballasted. See Marine Ordinances of Louis XIV, Book II, art. VIII, Moloy, De Jure Maritimo et Navali (7th Ed. 1722) p. 223. The seaman's right of indemnity was sustained in The City of Alexandria (D.C.) 17 F. 390; The Edith Godden (D. C.) 23 F. 43; Olson v. Flavel (D.C.) 34 F. 477; The A. Heaton (C.C.) 43 F. 592; The Frank and Willie (D.C.) 45 F. 494; The Julia Fowler (D.C.) 49 F. 277. A seaman was denied recovery for injuries in Couch v. Steele (1853) 3 El. & Bl. 402, on the ground that the owner owed to seamen no duty to make the vessel seaworthy. This case was disapproved in The Noddleburn, supra, 28 F. 855, 857, which allowed recovery for an injury due to defective rigging. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, 39-40 Vict. ch. 80,  5, provided that there should be imported into every contract of service between the owner of the vessel and the seamen on board an implied obligation 'that the owner of the ship and the master, and every agent charged with the loading of the ship or the preparing thereof for sea or the sending thereof to sea shall use all reasonable means to insure the seaworthiness of the ship for the voyage at the time when the voyage commences and to keep her in a seaworthy condition for the voyage during the same.'

Bachrack, of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.[ Tipton v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co. \n298 U.S. 141\n (1936) ]\n\n\n[298 U.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Leo E. Sievert, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, a citizen of California, brought an action against the respondent in the superior court of the state to recover for injuries sustained in the course of his employment as a switchman. The complaint recites that the respondent, a Kansas corporation, is a common carrier by railroad in interstate commerce, authorized to transact business in California, and that the line on which the accident occurred is a highway of interstate commerce. The cause of petitioner's injury is alleged to have been a defective coupling apparatus upon a freight car, used in violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Acts. \n1\n The complaint does not state that, at the time of the accident, petitioner was engaged in interstate commerce. After removal to the federal court, a demurrer was filed challenging the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The demurrer was sustained and leave to amend refused. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that as the petitioner, when injured, was not engaged in interstate commerce, he may seek redress only \n\n[298 U.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n under the California Workmen's Compensation Act (Gen.Laws Cal.1931, Act 4749).2 The petitioner sought review by this court on the ground that the decision conflicts with adjudications of the California courts sustaining the right to maintain an action for damages in like circumstances. We granted certiorari.\n The Safety Appliance Acts impose an absolute duty upon an employer and prescribe penal sanctions for breach. The earliest, that of 1893, affected only cars which were being used in interstate commerce. By the Act of 1903, the duty was extended to all cars used upon any railroad which is a highway of interstate commerce. \n3\n The absolute duty imposed necessarily supersedes the common-law duty of the employer. But, unlike the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 U.S.C.A.  51-59), which gives a right of action for negligence, the Safety Appliance Acts leave the nature and the incidents of the remedy to the law of the states. \n4\n The Safety Appliance Acts modify the enforcement, by civil action, of the employee's common-law right in only one aspect; namely, by withdrawing the defense of assumption of risk. \n5\n They do not touch the common or statute law of a state governing venue, limitations, contributory negligence, or recovery for death by wrongful act. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[298 U.S. 141, 147]\n\u00a0\n In Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33\n, 36 S.Ct. 482, it was decided that, as the first Safety Appliance Act had been extended by later legislation to equipment used in intrastate transportation upon a railroad which is a highway of interstate commerce, an employee injured as the result of a violation of the act, in respect of a car so used, is entitled to recover for breach of the duty imposed on the carrier. Nothing more was there adjudicated. While the opinion discussed the power of Congress, in connection with such regulation of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, not only to enlarge the common- law duty of the employer and thus alter substantive rights of the empoloyee, but also to afford a correlative remedy, the construction put upon the Safety Appliance Acts was that they remit the person injured to such remedy as the state law affords.\n As respects an injury occurring during the course of employment in intrastate activities on a highway of interstate commerce, the question has arisen whether a state may substitute workmen's compensation for the common-law or statutory action whereby damages could have been recovered for violation of the Safety Appliance Acts. A number of courts have interpreted the discussion in the Rigsby Case as a denial of the power of the states to make the substitution. \n 7\n\u00a0\n\n This court has recently reaffirmed the principle that the Safety Appliance Acts do not give a right of action \n\n[298 U.S. 141, 148]\n\u00a0\n for their breach, but leave the genesis and regulation of such action to the law of the states. In Moore v. C. & O. Ry. Co., \n291 \nU.S. 205\n, 54 S.Ct. 402, it was held competent for a state to embody the provisions of the Federal Safety Appliance Acts in its own statute and to provide that an employee, injured by violation of the federal acts, should have a cause of action under the local statute. In Gilvary v. Cuyahoga Valley Railway Co., \n292 U.S. 578\n 54 S.Ct. 573, it was decided that an elective Compensation Act afforded appropriate redress to an employee injured in intrastate transportation as a result of violation of the Safety Appliance Acts; and it was said that those acts do not dictate or prescribe the method of the enforcement of the liability arising from the breach of the duty they impose, or extend to the field occupied by a state Compensation Act. In Fairport, etc., R. Co. v. Meredith, \n292 \nU.S. 589\n, 54 S.Ct. 826, an action in a state court, based upon a violation of the Safety Appliance Acts, this court held that application of the doctrines of contributory negligence and last clear chance by the state court raised no federal questions reviewable here.\n In McMahon v. Montour R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 628\n, 46 S.Ct. 207, cited by the petitioner, the judgment of the state court was reversed, not because that court had held that remedy for breach of the duty imposed by the Safety Appliance Acts was afforded by the state Workmen's Compensation Law, but because of its erroneous decision that the federal acts were inapplicable to the cars used in intrastate operations of the railroad, although it was a highway of interstate commerce. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n California is at liberty to afford any appropriate remedy for breach of the duty imposed by the Safety Appliance Acts. Her choice in the matter raises no federal question, and the federal courts are as much bound as those of \n\n[298 U.S. 141, 149]\n\u00a0\n California to conform to the remedial procedure she has adopted. There is nothing to prevent her prescribing workmen's compensation, elective or compulsory, in lieu of a common-law or statutory action for disability or death arising from a breach of the duty imposed. The question is: Has California, as the petitioner insists, excepted from the scope of yer Workmen's Compensation Act injuries sustained by an employee engaged in intrastate transportation? The Circuit Court of Appeals thought she had not. Whether this conclusion is right depends upon the force and effect of two District Court of Appeal decisions, which the Supreme Court of the state refused to review.\n Ballard v. Sacramento Northern Railway Company, 126 Cal.App. 486, 14 P.(2d) 1045, 15 P.(2d) 793, was an action by the administratrix of a brakeman who was killed as a result of a violation of the Safety Appliance Acts. The defendant's railroad was a highway of interstate commerce, but the decedent was not engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the accident. The complaint contained no count based upon the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Nevertheless, the court, in affirming a judgment for the plaintiff, dealt with the trial court's charge as to contributory negligence as if the action were one brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act,9 and referred to the amending Act of 1910,10 conferring on state and federal courts concurrent jurisdiction of actions for damages under the Liability Act, which has no bearing upon actions brought under the Safety Appliance Acts. The railway company insisted that the state Workmen's Compensation Act afforded the only redress for the dece ent's death. In overruling the contention, the court cited Smithson v. A., T. & S.F. Ry. Co., 174 Cal. \n\n[298 U.S. 141, 150]\n\u00a0\n 148, 162 P. 111, a case dealing not with the Safety Appliance Acts, but with the Federal Employers' Liability Act, saying that the two statutes correspond in force and effect. The court added (126 Cal.App. 486, at page 495, 14 P.(2d) 1045, 1049, 15 P.(2d) 793): 'By subdivision (c) of section 69 of the Workmen's Compensation Act (St.1917, p. 877), it is expressly provided that where interstate commerce questions are presented, resort to the courts is not prohibited.'\n In Walton v. So. Pac. Co. (Cal.App.) 48 P.(2d) 108, 115, plaintiff, as administratrix, sued for the death of her husband, an employee of the defendant. The first and third counts were based upon the Federal Employers' Liability Act; alleged the decedent and the defendant were engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the accident; and described the negligence alleged to have caused the decedent's death. The second count was founded upon the Federal Boiler Inspection Act. \n11\n A trial resulted in a judgment for the plaintiff. Holding that the decedent was not engaged in interstate transportation, the court proceeded to discuss the count framed under the Boiler Inspection Act. It overruled the defendant's contention that the cause of action was barred, basing its decision upon the section of the state Code of Civil Procedure limiting the time within which to bring an action for death. In this connection the court referred to Moore v. C. & O. Ry. Co., supra, as deciding that the Safety Appliance Acts do not affect the time of bringing suit or govern the right to recover for death; and also noted the statement in Gilvary v. Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co., supra, that the right to recover damages sustained by the injured employee 'sprang from the principle of the common law' and was left to be enforced accordingly or, in the case of death, 'according to the applicable statute,' \n\n[298 U.S. 141, 151]\n\u00a0\n and that the safety acts 'do not extend to the field occupied by the State Compensation Act.' Correctly holding that the same principles apply in an action under the Boiler Inspection Act as in one under the Safety Appliance Acts, the court said that the former does not purport to provide remedial procedure where it is invoked as a ground of recovery for death caused in an intrastate operation, and added: 'Hence, in an intrastate case such as this, the state law applies.' Dealing with the defendant's contention respecting the Workmen's Compensation Act, the court said (48 P.( 2d) 108, at page 115):\n'The appellant's contentions that the sole remedy of an employee of a common carrier, engaged in interstate transportation, or, in this case, of his personal representative, where, at the time of the injury, the employee was not engaged in interstate transportation, but under circumstances where there has been a violation of duty imposed by the Boiler Inspection Act, is under the State Workmen's Compensation Act are untenable (St.1917, p. 831, as amended). The evidence here shows that the accident happened on a highway of interstate commerce. ...\n\n'Under the authority of Ballard v. Sacramento Northern Railway Co., 126 Cal.App. 486, 14 P.(2d) 1045, 15 P.(2d) 793, the instant suit is maintainable.'\n\n If these decisions of intermediate Courts of Appeal, and the refusal of the Supreme Court of California to review them, amount to no more than a judicial construction of the Compensation Act as having, by its terms, no application in the circumstances, they are binding authority in federal courts. \n12\n If, on the other hand, the state courts excluded railroad employees injured in intrastate operations from the benefits of the Compensation Act, not as a matter of construction of the statute, but because they thought the Safety Appliance Acts required the state to \n\n[298 U.S. 141, 152]\n\u00a0\n afford a remedy in the nature of an action for damages, then the court below was right in disregarding that erroneous construction of the federal acts. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n In the Ballard Case, the court thought the Safety Appliance Acts, in addition to imposing a duty, afforded a remedy, and to deny that remedy would be to disregard the mandate of the federal statutes. It was proper, in this view, to construe the language of the Compensation Act accordingly. In the Walton Case, while holding the Boiler Inspection Act irrelevant upon the question of the appropriate remedy, the court denied the application of the Workmen's Compensation Law, upon the authority of the Ballard Case.\n The Supreme Court of the state refused to review either of the cases, although this court had recently defined the scope of the Safety Appliance Acts in the Moore and Gilvary Cases. If we were convinced that the court acted solely upon a construction of the Workmen's Compensation Law, uninfluenced by the decisions following the supposed authority of the Rigsby Case, we should not hesitate to hold United States courts bound by such construction of the state statute. But the terms of the state Compensation Law, and the California decisions construing it, lead us to doubt that this is so.\n The act, in section 6, provides:14\n'(a) Liability for the compensation provided by this act, in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person, shall, without regard to negligence, exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his employees arising out of and in the course of the employment. ...\n\n'(b) Where such conditions of compensation exist, the right to recover such compensation, pursuant to the provisions of this act, shall be the exclusive remedy against the employer for the injury or death.' \n\n[298 U.S. 141, 153]\n\u00a0\n Section 69 provides:15 '(c) Employers engaged in interstate commerce. This act shall not be construed to apply to employers or employments which, according to law, are so engaged in interstate commerce as not to be subject to the legislative power of the state, or to employees injured while they are so engaged, except in so far as this act may be permitted to apply under the provisions of the constitution of the United States or the acts of congress.'\n\n Thus, by its plain terms, the Compensation Law embraces injuries to an employee circumstanced as was the petitioner in this case. Employers or employments in interstate commerce (the phrase used) obviously signifies situations covered by the Federal Employers' Liability Act which gives a right of action for breach. The phrase does not exclude injuries consequent upon violation of the Safety Appliance Acts in intrastate commerce, and the remainder of the section evidences a determination that the Compensation Act shall govern the rights of employees in interstate commerce so far as permissible under the federal laws. \n16\n As has been shown, these laws do not forbid its application in the instant case.\n The Supreme Court of California has repeatedly declared the purpose and effect of the Compensation Act.\n'The enactment substitutes a new system of rights and obligations for the common-law rules governing the liability of employers for injuries to their workmen. The change thus made is radical, not to say revolutionary. In place of the old action, in which the employer was liable only if he, or some one representing him, had been guilty of negligence or misconduct, the new law imposes upon the employer a liability for any accidental injuries to his employees aris ng out of the employment-a liability not \n\n[298 U.S. 141, 154]\n\u00a0\n conditioned upon any negligence of the employer, or any want of negligence on the part of the employee.'17\n\n'The California Workmen's Compensation Act provides the only means by which an injured employee can recover compensation from his employer for injuries received in the course of and arising out of his employment, and it abrogates the common-law liability of the master for such injuries in the cases to which it is applicable. Netherlands American Steam Nav. Co. v. Gallagher (C.C.A.) 282 F. 171, 183. The obvious intent of the act was to substitute its procedure for the former method of settling disputes arising between those occupying the strict relationship of master and servant, or employer and employee, by means of actions for damages. Cooper v. Industrial Acc. Comm., 177 Cal. 685, 687, 171 P. 684. It substitutes a new system of rights and obligations for the common-law rules governing the liability of employers for injuries to their employees. Western Indemnity Co. v. Pillsbury, 170 Cal. 686, 692, 151 P. 398. When the specified conditions exist, the remedy provided by the act is exclusive of all other statutory or common-law remedies. De Carli v. Associated Oil Co., 57 Cal.App. 310, 207 P. 282.'18\n\n We are not persuaded that if the state courts had thought that California was free to ordain a plan of workmen's compensation in lieu of an action for damages for breach of the duty imposed by the Safety Appliance Acts they would have restricted the scope of the Workmen's \n\n[298 U.S. 141, 155]\n\u00a0\n Compensation Act as was done in the Ballard and Walton Cases. A definite and authoritiative decision that its scope is so limited, and that the appropriate remedy under state law is an action for damages, will, of course, be binding upon federal courts. In the absence of such a pronouncement, we are of opinion the Circuit Court of Appeals committed no error in construing the Workmen's Compensation Act as affording the only remedy available to the petitioner.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO concurs in the result upon the authority of Gilvary v. Cuyahoga Valley Railway Co., \n292 \nU.S. 57\n, 54 S.Ct. 573. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] March 2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531, U.S.C., tit. 45,  1-7, 45 U.

Giffen Levy, both of New Orleans, La., for appellant.\n Mr. Delvaille H. Theard, of New Orleans, La., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 189, 191]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is one of five appeals1 from a decision of the Supreme Court of Louisiana,2 presenting the question whether certain provisions of Act No. 140, adopted by the Legislature of that state on July 12, 1932,3 are consistent with article 1,  10, and section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the Constitution of the United States.\n Prior to the adoption of Act No. 140 the laws of Louisiana provided that every stockholder of a domestic building and loan association should have the right to withdraw as a member upon filing a written notice of intention so to do; and thereupon to receive the amount of his investment and a share of the profits. Every association was required to keep a register, in which notices of withdrawal were to be entered in the order of presentation; and to pay withdrawals in that order. If the proportion of the association's income ordinarily made applicable to the demands of withdrawing members was insufficient to pay all such demands within sixty days from date of notice, one-half of the association's receipts was to be set apart to liquidate such members' claims, until all deferred claims were paid. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[297 U.S. 189, 192]\n\u00a0\n On May 19, 1932, appellant, as owner of fifty shares of full-paid stock of appellee, a building and loan association incorporated and domiciled in Louisiana, gave a written withdrawal notice. Thereafter the Legislature adopted Act No. 140 of 1932. By section 53 the directors of any association are authorized, before making any appropriation of receipts which may be applied to the liquidation of claims of withdrawing members, to use its receipts and funds for operating expenses, maintenance, and improvement of repossessed property, payment of obligations, and creation of cash reserves for future dividends. Section 54 provides that whenever, subsequent to the passage of the act, the proportion of receipts ordinarily made applicable to the demands of withdrawing members is insufficient to pay all such demands within sixty days from date of application for withdrawal, the applicant first on the list shall receive 25 per cent. of the amount due him; not less, however, than $500. As to any balance his claim is to be transferred to the end of the list and, except as hereafter noted, he is to receive no further payments until his name shall have reached the head of the list. Each pending application is to be similarly treated. New applications are to be placed at the foot of the list. The association may, however, in its discretion, pay in full any demand which amounts to less than $100 and may also pay not more than $100 per month to any applicant if the directors find his necessities call for such payment.\n Section 55 gives the directors discretionary power to authorize an allowance on the amount of unpaid withdrawals under such terms and conditions as to the amount of individual withdrawals in view of the time the application has been on the list, or otherwise, as the board may decide; but the amount of such allowance is not to exceed 60 per cent. of the rate of dividend currently paid in cash on continuing members' shares. The allowance may be withdrawn at any time without affecting the \n\n[297 U.S. 189, 193]\n\u00a0\n association's right to continue to pay dividends on the shares of continuing members.\n Section 56 empowers the directors to allocate, from receipts or other assets, sums to be paid withdrawing members; and supersedes the earlier provision for setting aside 50 per cent. of all receipts for this purpose. The section further provides that 25 per cent. of the gross receipts may be used for making loans notwithstanding the existence of a withdrawal list and that all, or any part, of the funds and current receipts may be expended for payment of debts, operating expenses, or dividends to continuing members.\n The appellant brought suit in the civil district court for the parish of Orleans to restrain the appellee from complying with the foregoing provisions of Act No. 140. In his petition he recited his ownership of full-paid shares; his rights under the association's charter and by-laws and the statutes in force prior to the adoption of that act; his application on May 19, 1932, for withdrawal of his shares. He alleged that, subsequent to the date of his notice, other similar applications had been paid in full but that his had not been reached for payment; that, in violation of the Contract Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, Act No. 140 purports to destroy and materially change his vested rights as a withdrawing shareholder. A rule nisi issued, the appellee answered, and also excepted to the petition and demand for failure to state a right of action or a cause of action. Judgment awarding an injunction was reversed by the Supreme Court of Louisiana and the suit was dismissed.\n The statute, in section 76, provides: 'Any person holding shares in an association ... who attacks the constitutionality ... of any ... provision of this statute, must file suit to that effect against the association within ninety days from the time when the \n\n[297 U.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n present Statute goes into effect; and said period of ninety days is now fixed as the term of prescription within which any remedy in that behalf must be instituted in the courts by any member or other person; and the failure to file such suit within that delay shall be deemed and held by all courts at all times thereafter as an acquiescence in ... any ... provision of the present statute and after such ninety-day period no further attack on the constitutionality of ... any ... provision of the present statute can be presented.'\n The appellant instituted his suit within the ninety-day period. In his petition he alleged that he had no adequate remedy at law, and that he would suffer irreparable injury if the appellee's officers acted as permitted or required by the statute. The Supreme Court said: 'There is no doubt, however, that the Act of 1932 did prevent some of the many withdrawing shareholders in building and loan associations throughout the state from collecting the amount of their shares in full at the time when payment would have been made if this statute had not been adopted. We shall rest this decision, therefore, upon the proposition that the Act of 1932 did deprive the plaintiff of an advantage, and of a valuable right, which he enjoyed by virtue of having his name on the withdrawal list more than sixty days before the statute was adopted. The question, therefore, is whether the Legislature could deprive the plaintiff of the advantage and right which he enjoyed, without violating the constitutional limitation forbidding the passing of a law impairing the obligation of contracts, or divesting vested rights.'\n The statute impairs the obligation of the appellant's contract and destroys his vested rights in contravention of article 1,  10, and Amendment 14,  1, of the Constitution.\n The court below held the challenged sections of the act proper exertions of the state's police power, upon \n\n[297 U.S. 189, 195]\n\u00a0\n the view that state legislation to promote health, safety, morals, or welfare cannot be defeated by private contracts between citizens, or nullified because i interferes with vested rights; and, since building and loan associations are creatures of the state, the power to alter and amend their charters inheres in the sovereign. The appellant, conceding the correctness of these propositions, insists that the statute is not in fact a valid exercise of the police power and cannot be sustained as an amendment of the association's charter.\n The appellee asserts the act was adopted to meet the existing economic emergency; members of, and borrowers from, building and loan associations found themselves unable to keep up their dues and interest payments; those whose savings were invested in the shares of such associations were compelled by their necessities to seek withdrawal of the investment; these conditions imperiled the usefulness, if not the existence, of many building and loan associations; the state had a vital interest in their preservation and the equitable administration of their assets in the interest of all concerned. The appellant replies that the sections under attack are neither intended nor adapted to conserve the assets of building associations, but, on the contrary, affect merely the rights of members inter sese, and are unreasonable and arbitrary interferences with vested contract rights.\n The act is a revision and codification of the statutory law governing building and loan associations, including their incorporation, management, supervision by state administrative authority, winding up, and dissolution. It does not purport to deal with any existing emergency and the provisions respecting the rights of withdrawing members are neither temporary nor conditional. Compare W. B. Worthen Co. v. Thomas, \n292 \nU.S. 426, 433\n, 434 S., 54 S.Ct. 816, 93 A.L.R. 173. The sections in question do not contemplate the liquidation of associations, the conservation of their assets, or \n\n[297 U.S. 189, 196]\n\u00a0\n the distribution thereof amongst creditors and members. Other sections deal with these matters. \n5\n Section 54 merely changes the order of payment of those entitled to withdraw their investments. The section effects no reduction in the amount of the debt, no postponement of payment of the total, but a redistribution of the proportions to be paid to individuals. The provision is comparable to a statute declaring that whereas preferred stockholders heretofore have enjoyed a priority in the distribution of assets, in that respect they shall hereafter stand pari passu with common stockholders. Such an interference with the right of contract cannot be justified by saying that in the public interest the operations of building associations may be controlled and regulated, or that in the same interest their charters may be amended. The statute merely attempts, for no discernible public purpose, the abrogation of contracts between members and the association lawful when made. This cannot be done under the guise of amending the charter powers of the corporation. Compare Bedford v. Eastern Building & Loan Association, \n181 \nU.S. 227\n, 21 S.Ct. 597.\n Under existing law, and the appellant's contract, 50 per cent. of the receipts of the association had to be set apart to pay withdrawing members. By the new legislation this requirement is abolished and the amount to be set aside is left to the sole discretion of the directors. They are authorized to apply the association's receipts to the making of loans, to payment of old or new debts, to dividends to continuing members, or to the creation of a cash reserve for future dividends. The sections permitting such use of the amounts collected do not tend to conserve the assets of the association, to render it more solvent, or to insure that its affairs will be administered so as to protect the investments of the continuing and \n\n[297 U.S. 189, 197]\n\u00a0\n withdrawing members. They do alter the rights of the withdrawing members as between themselves and as against continuing members.\n The appellee bases its entire argument in support of the challenged enactment upon the proposition that, as building and loan associations are incorporated for a quasi-public purpose, the state has a peculiar interest and a concomitant power of supervision and regulation to prevent injury and loss to their members; and it is said that this court affirmed the principle in Hopkins Federal Savings & Loan Association v. Cleary, \n296 \nU.S. 315\n, 56 S.Ct. 235. We have no disposition to qualify what was there said. We recognize that these associations, like banks and public service companies, are subject to a degree of regulation which would be unnecessary and unreasonable in the case of a purely private corporation. But laws touching building and loan associations, like those affecting banks or utility companies, must be confined to purposes reasonably connected with the public interest as distinguished from purely private rights. The Legislature has no greater power to interfere with the private contracts of such corporations, or the vested rights of their stockholders as such, under the pretext of public necessity, than it would have to attempt the same ends in a case of a private corporation. Though the obligations of contracts must yield to a proper exercise of the police power,6 and vested rights cannot inhibit the proper exertion of the power, 7 it must be exercised for an end which is in fact public and the means adopted must be reasonably adapted to the accomplishment of that end and must not be arbitrary or oppressive.\n As we have pointed out, the questioned sections deal only with private rights, and are not adapted to the legitimate end of conserving or equitably administering the \n\n[297 U.S. 189, 198]\n\u00a0\n assets in the interest of all members. They deprive withdrawing members of a solvent association of existing contract rights, for the benefit of those who remain. We hold the challenged provisions impair the obligation of the appellant's contract and arbitrarily deprive him of vested property rights without due process of law.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana must be reversed. As Nos. 288, 289, 290, and 316 involve the same question as the instant case, a like judgment will be entered in each.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The companion cases are: No. 288, Treigle v.

Each claim was held invalid by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Radio Corporation v. Du- \n\n[297 U.S. 638, 640]\n\u00a0\n bilier Condenser Corporation, 59 F.(2d) 305, 309, and petitions to this Court for certiorari were denied, \n287 \nU.S. 648, 650\n, 53 S.Ct. 96. More than eight months after the denial of certiorari respondents filed, in the Patent Office, purported disclaimers of each of the claims thus held invalid, and more than a month later began the present suit in the District Court for Maryland to restrain infringement of the same claims and other claims of the same patents not previously adjudicated. A motion to dismiss the suits as to both patents for unreasonable delay in filing disclaimers of the claims previously held invalid, and because the disclaimers were inadequate, was granted by the District Court upon the latter ground.\n The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial, 77 F.(2d) 556, holding that respondents were not barred from maintaining the second suit, against different defendants, for infringement of the claims previously held invalid, and that the disclaimer of those claims was not prerequisite to maintenance of the suit upon the claims not previously adjudicated. It intimated that the second suit could not be maintained unless brought without unreasonable delay, but it concluded that it could not say that there had been unreasonable delay in the present case.\n Whether the respondents' disclaimers are merely an attempted formal alteration of the claims so as to conform them more precisely to the specifications without changing their substance or conceding their invalidity, see Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., \n185 \nU.S. 403, 435\n, 22 S.Ct. 698, or whether they are in effect such alterations of the substance of the claims as to bring them within the requirements and limitations of the reissue statute, Rev.St.  4916, as amended May 24, 1928, 35 U.S.C.  64 (35 U.S.C.A.  64) so as to render both the old and the new claims invalid, see Altoona Public Theatres, Inc., v. American Tri- Ergon Corporation, \n294 U.S. 477\n, 490-492, 55 S.Ct. 455, \n\n[297 U.S. 638, 641]\n\u00a0\n are questions which have been much argued here and below. In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeals assumed, as we shall assume without deciding, that the disclaimers were inadequate because they failed to concede invalidity of the adjudicated claims. It concluded that if the same decision were reached, as to the validity of the claims previously adjudicated, as in the Third Circuit, the respondents' suit must fail both as to them and as to all the other claims, 'even though some of them may be good; for it would then be established that the owner of the patent had failed to file disclaimers within a reasonable time after notice of the invalidity of some of the claims had been brought home to him.' 77 F.(2d) 556, 561.\n Revised Statutes,  4917 (35 U.S.C.A.  65) provides that 'Whenever, through inadvertence, accident, or mistake, ... a patentee has claimed more tha that of which he was the original or first inventor, ... his patent shall be valid for all that part which is truly and justly his own,' and authorizes him to file in the Patent Office a written disclaimer of 'such parts of the thing patented as he shall not choose to claim.' Revised Statutes,  4922 (35 U.S.C.A.  71) authorizes a patentee who has claimed more than that of which he was the inventor, to maintain a suit for the infringement of 'any part' of the patent 'which was bona fide his own, if it is a material and substantial part of the thing patented, and definitely distinguishable from the parts claimed without right, notwithstanding the specifications may embrace more than that of which the patentee was the first inventor or discoverer,' but with the proviso that 'no patentee shall be entitled to the benefits of this section if he has unreasonably neglected or delayed to enter a disclaimer.'\n Petitioners contend that if any claim of a patent is adjudged invalid no further suit can be maintained upon it, or upon other claims of the patent without disclaimer \n\n[297 U.S. 638, 642]\n\u00a0\n of the claims previously held invalid. This contention is predicated upon the rule that, save for the disclaimer statute, adjudication of invalidity of any claim of a patent renders the entire patent void, and upon the assumption that by force of the statute, if not without it, an adverse decision on any claim is final and conclusive as to its invalidity, in any court, except as modified upon an appellate review. If this view be accepted, it follows that the right to maintain suit for infringement of the separable claims of a patent which already have been held valid, or have not been adjudicated, may alone be saved by disclaimer of all claims held invalid, within a reasonable time after their adjudication; the patentee may not contest again the validity of the claims held invalid, and only by abandoning them by timely disclaimer may he litigate other claims.\n Neither reason nor authority supports the contention that an adjudication adverse to any or all the claims of a patent precludes another suit upon the same claims against a different defendant. While the earlier decision may by comity be given great weight in a later litigation and thus persuade the court to render a like decree, it is not res adjudicate and may not be pleaded as a defense. See Mast, Foos & Co. v. Stover Mfg. Co., \n177 \nU.S. 485\n, 20 S.Ct. 708; Sanitary Refrigerator Co. v. Winters, \n280 \nU.S. 30, 35\n, 50 S.Ct. 9. The disclaimer statute was enacted to mitigate the harsh rule1 that the entire patent was destroyed if any claim \n\n[297 U.S. 638, 643]\n\u00a0\n were held invalid. See Altoona Public Theatres, Inc., v. American Tri- Ergon Corporation, supra, \n294 \nU.S. 477, 490\n, 55 S.Ct. 455; Ensten v. Simon, Ascher & Co., \n282 \nU.S. 445, 452\n, 51 S.Ct. 207; Hailes v. Albany Stove Co., \n123 \nU.S. 582, 589\n, 8 S.Ct. 262; Moody v. Fiske (C.C.) Fed.Cas. No. 9,745, 2 Mason, 112, 118. The statute permits the patentee to abandon by disclaimer parts of the patent which he does not choose to claim, and if the disclaimer is timely and adequate it authorizes him to maintain suit for infringement of the separable parts which he does choose to claim. But neither in terms nor by implication does it deny to a patentee the right to bring a second suit for the infringement of a claim already held to be invalid. If such were its construction, it would deny to a patentee the right to relitigate claims held invalid when others are held valid or are not in issue, but would leave that right unaffected when the entire patent is held invalid, since in that case there would be nothing to disclaim. See Winans v. New York & Erie R. Co., 21 How. 88, 103. Only a plain legislative command would justify a construction leading to such incongruous results.\n While the contention now made is apparently for the first time seriously argued here, this Court has several times held valid the claims of a patent which had been held invalid by a Circuit Court of Appeals in an earlier suit brought by the same plaintiff against another defendant. Expanded Metal Co. v. Bradford, \n214 \nU.S. 366\n, 29 S.Ct. 652; Diamond Rubber Co. v. Consolidated Rubber Tire Co., \n220 \nU.S. 428\n, 31 S.Ct. 444; Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Baldwin, \n\n[297 U.S. 638, 644]\n\u00a0\n \n245 \nU.S. 198\n, 38 S.Ct. 104. 2 Before the establishment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, an adverse decision as to the validity of a patent in one circuit appears not to have foreclosed litigation of the same issue in another, see Barbed Wire Patent, \n143 \nU.S. 275\n, 12 S.Ct. 443, 450; compare United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., \n128 \nU.S. 315, 372\n, 9 S.Ct. 90. That it does not now is implicitly recognized by the practice established under section 240(a) of the Judicial Code 28 U.S.C.A.  347(a) and Rule 38(5) of this Court (28 U. S.C.A. following section 354), that certiorari will not usually be granted in patent cases unless there is a conflict in the decisions of Circuit Courts of Appeals. We conclude that neither the rules of the common law applicable to successive litigations concerning the same subject-matter, nor the disclaimer statute, precludes relitigation of the validity of a patent claim previously held invalid in a suit against a different defendant.\n It follows that want of disclaimer of claims previously held invalid can never be set up as a bar in limine to the maintenance of a second suit upon those claims, and any others of the patent, since the patentee is entitled to invoke in that suit the independent judgment of the court upon the validity of the claims which have been held invalid. In advance of its decision as to validity, that court cannot consistently hold that there is necessity for disclaiming claims which, although previously adjudged invalid, it may hold to be valid. The statute does not command that a court authorized to pass upon the validity of a claim shall accept as conclusive a pre- \n\n[297 U.S. 638, 645]\n\u00a0\n vious adjudication of invalidity of the same claim for the purpose of ascertaining whether the disclaimer statute applies. On the contrary, section 4922 in terms permits the patentee to 'maintain a suit ... for the infringement of any part' of the patent 'which was bona fide his own.'\n The court whose jurisdiction is invoked by such a suit must determine for itself validity and ownership of the claims asserted, notwithstanding a prior adjudication of invalidity of some of them, unless those issues have become res adjudicate, by reason of the fact that both suits are between the same parties or their privies. If it determines that the claims previously adjudicated are valid, there is no occasion for disclaimer. In such a case the intimation of the court below that the second suit must be brought within a reasonable time is without support, for if in that court the claims are upheld, there is nothing to disclaim, and the statute does not apply. Only if it holds that the claims are invalid may it be called upon to apply the disclaimer statute and to decide whether the patentee, under all the circumstances presented, has unreasonably neglected or delayed to enter a disclaimer of the claim of whose invalidity he had notice in the prior suit. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The disclaimer statute is remedial, and intended for the protection of both the patentee and the public. See O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 121. Both are protected by the construction which we adopt and which we think is the only admissible one. The patentee is free to preserve some of the claims of his patent by disclaiming \n\n[297 U.S. 638, 646]\n\u00a0\n others which have been held invalid, but the statute does not force him to pay that price in order to save them. He may relinquish the privilege of disclaimer, and proceed to relitigate, in another court, the claims which have been declared to be invalid, but at the risk of loss in that court of the other claims of the patent even though valid, if it likewise holds invalid the previously adjudicated claims.\n A different question is presented where the claims adjudged invalid are abandoned, whether by a tardy disclaimer or otherwise, and a second suit is brought to restrain infringement of other claims, see Ensten v. Simon, Ascher & Co., supra , or where in the same suit in which some claims are held invalid the plaintiff seeks to secure without disclaimer the benefits of a favorable decision on other claims. See R. Hoe & Co. v. Goss Printing Press Co. (C.C.A.) 31 F.(2d) 565; Higgin Mfg. Co. v. Watson ( C.C.A.) 263 F. 378; Liquid Carbonic Co. v. Gilchrist Co. (C.C.A.) 253 F. 54; Herman v. Youngstown Car Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.) 191 F. 579.\n We do not decide whether the purported disclaimers operate to enlarge the claims in such fashion as to render both the old and the new claims invalid by virtue of the reissue statute. See Altoona Public Theatres, Inc ., v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation, supra, \n294 U.S. 477\n, 490-492, 55 S. Ct. 455. That question is not presented by the petition for certiorari. The courts below do not appear to have passed upon it, and it may be unnecessary to decide it on the new trial. The decree will be affirmed.\n No. 590.\n In No. 590 the questions certified are as follows:\n\n 1. \nWhere certain but not all of the claims of a patent are in suit, and all of the claims in suit are held and decreed to be invalid pursuant to a finding and judgment to that effect of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the cir- \n\n[297 U.S. 638, 647]\n\u00a0\n cuit, may the owner of the patent maintain a suit afterward brought thereon in the same judicial circuit as that in which the first cause was decided, and against a different defendant not involved in the first suit- the second suit being based on the claims held in the prior suit to be invalid and on othe claims of the same patent not previously adjudicated- where the owner of the patent wholly failed and omitted to file any disclaimer of the claims held in the first suit to be invalid, and where, between entry of decree of invalidity of the claims in the first suit and the bringing of the second suit in the same circuit, reasonable time had elapsed for filing such disclaimer?\n\n 2. \nIf question 1 is answered in the affirmative, does the intervention of a period of approximately five years between the final judgment in the first suit and the institution in the same circuit of the second suit constitute delay so unreasonable as to bar the second suit for want of disclaimer of the claims which had been held to be invalid?\n\n 3. \nIf question 2 is answered affirmatively, may the institution or pendency of other suits in another judicial circuit or circuits after entry of final decree in the first suit, based on claims of the patent so held invalid and on other claims thereof not previously adjudicated to be invalid, excuse the failure to file disclaimer of the claims held invalid prior to instituting the later suit in the same circuit?\n From the facts stated in the certificate, it appears that the District Court below, upon hearing the cause, decreed the several claims, on which the plaintiff relied, to be invalid 'for various reasons, among them for neglect to file within reasonable time disclaimers' of the claims previously held invalid by the Court of Appeals for the same circuit. It does not appear whether the District \n\n[297 U.S. 638, 648]\n\u00a0\n Court, independently of the defense of want of disclaimer, passed upon the validity of the claims previously adjudicated and decided that they were invalid upon the evidence presented, or whether it held that all inquiry as to their validity was foreclosed by the prior adjudication.\n From what we have said in our opinion in No. 388, it is manifest that the effect rightly to be given to the failure to disclaim may turn upon the disposition which the trial court makes of the claims previously held invalid, and that there is no occasion for the application of the disclaimer statute until the trial court has itself passed on the validity of the previously adjudicated claims. The fact that the suit was brought in the same circuit where the Court of Appeals had previously held some of the claims invalid is immaterial, for the court must decide whether the issues of law and fact in the two cases are the same, and if they are not it is not bound by the earlier decision.\n This Court cannot be required, by certificate, to answer, and it should not answer, questions which cover unstated matter 'lurking in the record,' see United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 66\n, 35 S.Ct. 16; Chicago, B.& Q.R. Co. v. Williams, \n205 \nU.S. 444, 454\n, 27 S.Ct. 559; Cross v. Evans, \n167 \nU.S. 60\n, 17 S.Ct. 733; United States v. Hall, \n131 \nU.S. 50, 52\n, 9 S.Ct. 663; or questions which admit of one answer under one set of circumstances and a different answer under another, neither of which is stated to be the basis of the questions certified. See White v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 51 S. Ct. 115; Hallowell v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 101, 107\n, 28 S. Ct. 498; Jewell v. Knight, \n123 \nU.S. 426, 435\n, 8 S.Ct. 193; Enfield v. Jordan, \n119 \nU.S. 680\n, 7 S.Ct. 358.\n Moreover, it does not appear that the claims not previously adjudicated constitute 'a material and substantial part of the thing patented, and definitely distinguishable' from the claims held invalid, so as to admit of the \n\n[297 U.S. 638, 649]\n\u00a0\n application of section 4922. We are not required to answer academic questions, or questions which may not arise in the pending controversy. See White v. Johnson, supra, \n282 \nU.S. 367, 373\n, 51 S.Ct. 115; United States v. Hall, supra; Webster v. Cooper, 10 How. 54, 55. For these reasons the first question is not answered.\n The second and third questions, by their term , require an answer only if the first is answered. In addition, the answers to both turn upon the question whether the patentee has 'unreasonably neglected or delayed to enter a disclaimer' within the meaning of section 4922, which can be answered only in the light of all relevant circumstances and the inferences to be drawn from them. Such questions are not properly the subject of a certificate, especially where, as here, it fails to disclose whether all the relevant facts and circumstances have been certified. Jewell v. Knight, supra; Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n215 \nU.S. 216, 221\n, 30 S.s.Ct. 86; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Williams, supra, \n205 \nU.S. 444, 452\n, 27 S.Ct. 559; United States v. City Bank of Columbus, 19 How. 385; United States v. Bailey, 9 Pet. 267, 274.\n Such aid as we are able to give in answering questions as to the scope and effect of the disclaimer statute which may be involved in the pending cause is afforded by our opinion in No. 388.\n The decree in No. 388 is affirmed.\n The certificate in No. 590is dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] By section 3 of the Patent Act of 1793, 1 Stat. 318, and section 6 of the Patent Act of 1836, 5 Stat. 117, an accurate description in writing of the invention in the patent application was prerequisite to the award of a patent. Section 6 of the Act of 1793, and section 15 of the Act of 1836, authorized the defendant in a patent suit, by way of defense, to prove that the specification of the patent 'contains more than is necessary to produce the described effect, ... or that the thing, thus secured by patent, was not originally discovered by the patentee.' By the Act of 1832. 4 Stat. 559, it was provided that whenever any patent shall be invalid by reason of failure to comply with the requirements of section 3 of the Act of 1793, it should be lawful to grant a new patent to the patentee for his invention, upon surrender of the old patent and compliance with section 3 of the Act of 1793. Section 13 of the Act of 1836 similarly authorized the new patent to issue 'in accordance with the patentee's corrected description and specification.' Section 7 of the Act of 1837, 5 Stat. 191, 193, carried into R.S.  4917 (35 U.S.C.A.  65) first permitted the patentee to preserve the valid part of his original patent by disclaimer. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In other cases this Court has held invalid, upon examination of the merits, a patent which had been upheld by one court of appeals after being held invalid by another. Railroad Supply Co. v. Elyria Iron Co., \n244 \nU.S. 285\n, 37 S.Ct. 502; Meccano, Ltd., v. John Wanamaker, \n253 \nU.S. 136\n, 40 S.Ct. 463; New York Scaffolding Co. v.

Whether the claims previously held invalid should be deemed abandoned and properly subject to disclaimer would depend upon special circumstances and involve questions not presented in the present suit. \n\n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTUTTLE v.

Evans, \n297 \nU.S. 216\n, 56 S.Ct. 412, decided at the same time, is one as to the meaning of the words 'equity receiverships' in the statute for the reorganization of debtor corporations. Bankruptcy Act  77B(a); 11 U.S. C.  207(a), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(a).\n A mortgagee brought suit against Granada Hotel Corporation in the superior court of Cook county, Ill., to foreclose a second mortgage upon real property of the corporation located in that state. A receiver was appointed to collect the rents and profits. Thereafter a prior mortgagee, the trustee under a deed of trust to \n\n[297 U.S. 225, 226]\n\u00a0\n secure an issue of bonds, brought suit to foreclose the prior mortgage, and in accordance with the law of Illinois laid claim to the possession of the property as owner after condition broken. In response to that claim the state court made an order discharging the receiver, and directing that the prior mortgagee be let into possession.\n While possession was so held, respondents brought a proceeding under Bankruptcy Act,  77B, contending that the possession of the mortgagee was that of an equity receiver or at least equivalent thereto. The District Court upheld that contention, denying a motion by petitioners, who had intervened in the proceeding to dismiss the application (In re Granada Hotel Corporation, 9 F.Supp. 909); and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. Id., 78 F.(2d) 409. A writ of certiorari issued from this court.\n An equity receivership within the meaning of the statute does not result from the appointment of a receiver for the collection of the rents in a suit to foreclose a mortgage. Duparquet, Huot & Moneuse Co. v. Evans, \n297 \nU.S. 216\n, 56 S.Ct. 412. But here there was no receiver either for the collection of rents or for any other purpose. A mortgagee after condition broken under the law of Illinois is the owner of a legal estate, and as such entitled as of right to the possession of the mortgaged premises. Wolkenstein v. Slonim, 355 Ill. 306, 189 N.E. 312. The grantee under the deed of trust was in possession not as receiver, but as owner.\n The decree should be reversed, and it is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTYSON v.

The petition, filed November 17, 1932, alleged that disability had existed ever since the claimant's discharge from the Army, December 18, 1918\n\n\n The trial court dismissed the cause for want of jurisdiction, being of opinion that it was not instituted within the prescribed time. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment.\n July 3, 1931, Tyson filed his claim with the Veterans' Administration. November 16, 1932, he received from it a letter, dated November 12, 1932, and mailed at Washington November 14, 1932, which stated that this had been denied. Also: 'You may consider such denial final for the purposes of instituting suit under section 19 of the World War Veterans' Act, 1924, as amended. If you accept the denial of the claim by the Council as final, the suspension of the statute of limitations provided by section 19 shall cease from and after the date of this letter plus the number of days usually required by the Post Office Department for the transmission of regular mail from Washington, D.C., to your last address of record.'\n The question for decision is whether the petitioner brought suit within the time permitted by section 19, Act of 1924, as amended, section 445, title 38, United States Code, c. 849,  4, c. 863,  1, 2, 46 Stat. 992, 1016, approved July 3, 1930 (38 U.S.C.A.  445).\n'No suit on yearly renewable term insurance shall be allowed under this section unless the same shall have been brought within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made or within one year after the date of approval of this amendatory Act (July 3, 1930), whichever is the later date; ...

Permission to sue had expired unless the limitation was suspended between the filing on July 3, 1931, and November 17, 1932, when proceedings began in the trial court.\n Whether the denial occurred November 12th, the date given the letter of advice, or November 14th, when this was mailed, or November 1 th, when the claimant actually received it, although much debated by counsel, we need not consider.\n The statute (38 U.S.C.A.  445) provides: 'No suit ... shall be allowed ... unless ... brought within six years after the right accrued ... or within one year after July 3, 1930, whichever is the later date.' But this limitation was suspended by the proviso for the period between the filing and denial of the claim.\n In any view, the denial occurred not later than November 16, 1932. And, with that day, the suspension of the statute ended-certainly the period between July 3, 1931, and November 16, 1932, did not extend beyond the latter day.

The petitioner in one of the cases (No. 75) is the United States, a defendant in the court below. The petitioner in the other ( No. 76) is the Collector of Internal Revenue for the Fifth District of New Jersey.\n Since 1907, the taxpayer, respondent, has been the owner of the Creveling patent for an improvement in the electric lighting equipment of railway passenger cars. It brought suit in 1912 against the United States Light & Heating Company to restrain an infringement of the patent, and for an accounting of damages and profits. The suit was pending on February 25, 1913, the effective date of the Sixteenth Amendment, and on March 1, 1913, the effective date of the first statute enacted thereunder.

Not till 1915 was the capital fact of an infringement determined. On February 15, 1915, there was entered in the District Court an interlocutory decree (Safety Car Heating & Lighting Co. v. U.S. Light & Heating Co., 222 F. 310) for an injunction, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (223 F. 1023) in July of the same year. An accounting followed before a master and continued for eight years. On that accounting the complainant waived any recovery for damages, and confined its claim to the profits received by the infringer. On May 26, 1923, the master filed his report in which he found that there was due to the complainant for profits received by the infringer between January 1, 1909, and April 30, 1914, the sum o $501,180. 32. Of this award, a large part ($436,137.41) was for profits applicable to the period before March 1, 1913. The report was confirmed by the District Court on October 10, 1923 (2 F.(2d) 384), at which time the infringing defendant was in the hands of receivers. A final decree followed in October, 1924, the award being adjudged to constitute a superior lien upon the assets of the infringer then held by a successor. Cross-appeals were carried to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the complainant contending that the award was too small, the infringer and its successor contending that the award was too large and that error had been committed also in the declaration of the lien. While the appeals were undetermined, the complainant accepted a settlement in May, 1925, after thirteen years of litigation, whereby it received from the infringer the sum of $200,000 in satisfaction of the judgment. After deducting the expenses incurred in connection with the suit ($23,468.05), the net amount collected was $176,531.95, of which part ($153,621.72) is attributable to acts of infringement before March 1, 1913, and part to such acts thereafter.\n In May, 1926, the taxpayer filed its income tax return for 1925, showing a net income for that year of $1,473, \n\n[297 U.S. 88, 92]\n\u00a0\n 187.13, and a tax due thereon of $172,610.19, which has been paid. It did not include in the return any part of the proceeds of the patent litigation ($176,531.95), nor did it claim any deduction for loss resulting from the settlement. Thereupon the Commissioner made a deficiency determination of $22,162.07, plus interest, the additional tax due after adding the net proceeds of the settlement to the income of the year. Two claims for refund followed. The first, filed in March, 1929, was for $69,729.18. The taxpayer took the ground that as a result of the settlement it had sustained a loss of $536,378.28, which through error it had failed to deduct in making its return and in paying the tax thereunder. Its books were kept on the accrual basis. The second of the two claims, filed in July, 1930, was for an additional refund in the amount of $19,970. 82. In this the taxpayer took the ground that in determining the gross income for 1925 the Commissioner had erred by including that part of the proceeds of the settlement attributable to acts of infringement before March, 1913. Both claims were rejected by the Commissioner. The taxpayer then sued, making the United States the defendant with reference to the first claim and the collector the defendant with reference to the second.\n In the suit against the United States the District Court found that the taxpayer's claim for damages on account of so much of the infringement as had occurred before March 1, 1913, had a 'market value' on that date of $ 436,137.41, the profits of the infringer up to that time as reported by the master. From this the court concluded that in the year 1925 there had been a deductible loss of the difference between $436,137.41 and the sum of $174,040.62, a like proportion of the $200,000 actually recovered. The tax upon this difference ($262,096.79) was $34,072.58. The taxpayer received an award of judgment for that amount with interest. 5 F.Supp. 276. In the suit against the collector, the District Court held that \n\n[297 U.S. 88, 93]\n\u00a0\n such portion of the net settlement as was allocable to acts of infringement before March 1, 1913 ($153,621.72), had accrued to the taxpayer i advance of that date, and was therefore to be treated as capital, not taxable as income for the year when the settlement was made. The taxpayer received an award of judgment for the tax on that amount (i.e ., for $24,732.90) with interest.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the judgments in both suits. 76 F.(2d) 133. To fix more precisely the taxable quality of contested and contingent choses in action belonging to a taxpayer before March 1, 1913, writs of certiorari issued from this court. \n296 \nU.S. 555\n, 56 S.Ct. 91.\n First. Congress intended, with exceptions not now important, to lay a tax upon the proceeds of claims or choses in action for the recovery of profits, unless the right to such recovery existed unconditionally on March 1, 1913, the effective date of the first statute under the Sixteenth Amendment.\n The tax imposed on the respondent was laid under the Revenue Act of 1926 (c. 27, 44 Stat. 9), which includes in gross income (section 213(a), 44 Stat. 23) gains on profits 'from any source whatever.' We have said of that act that it reveals in its provisions an intention on the part of Congress to reach 'pretty much every sort of income subject to the federal power.' Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, \n293 \nU.S. 84, 89\n, 55 S.Ct. 50, 52. There is no denial that profits owing to a patentee by the infringer of a patent are income within the meaning of the statute, unless withdrawn from that category by the date of the infringement. Cf.T. R. 45, Art. 52; T.R. 62, Art. 51; T.R. 65, Art. 50; T.R. 69, Art. 50; Commissioner v. S. A. Woods Machine Co. (C.C.A.) 57 F.(2d) 635.\n Until July, 1915, the existence of any liability was contested and uncertain. The amount remained contested and uncertain until May, 1925, when there was a \n\n[297 U.S. 88, 94]\n\u00a0\n settlement of the liability reported by the master. Then for the first time the profits flowing from the infringement became taxable as income. North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet, \n286 \nU.S. 417, 423\n, 52 S.Ct. 613; Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 451\n, 452 S., 50 S.Ct. 202, 67 A.L.R. 1010; Lucas v. North Texas Lumber Co., \n281 \nU.S. 11\n, 50 S.Ct. 184; Burnet v. Huff, \n288 \nU.S. 156\n, 53 S.Ct. 330. The respondent admits this to be true to the extent that the acts of infringement were later than February, 1913. The argument seems to be, however, that accrual has a different meaning when applied to income generated by acts committed earlier. But plainly the respondent's exemption, if it exists, will have to rest upon some other basis. A claim for profits so contingent and indefinite as to lack the quality of accrued income in March, 1913, cannot have had the quality of such income before that time, its existence and extent being then equally uncertain. Only an arbitrary dichotomy could bring us to the conclusion that part of the recovery was income to the taxpayer as of the date of payment or collection and part as of the date of the underlying wrong. The respondent, to prevail, must be able to make out that though the profits were income in their entirety as of May, 1925, there was an intention of the Congress that part of this income, the part attributable to acts before March, 1913, should be excluded from the reckoning.\n We find no disclosure of that intention in the provisions of the statute, and none in the history of other acts before it. The first statute following the Sixteenth Amendment laid a tax, as we have seen, on the entire net income 'accrued' within each calendar year; the impost being coupled with a proviso that for the year 1913 what was to be taxed should be the entire net income 'accrued' within that portion of the year from March 1 to the end. Definiteness of meaning was given to that and later acts by Treasury Regulations. Article 90 of Regulations 62, \n\n[297 U.S. 88, 95]\n\u00a0\n adopted in 1922, provides: 'Any claim existing unconditionally on March 1, 1913, whether presently payable or not, and held by a taxpayer prior to March 1, 1913, whether evidence by writing or not' does 'not constitute taxable income, although actually recovered or received subsequent to such date.' This provision appears without change of form in all Treasury Regulations adopted since that time. T.R. 65, Art. 90; T.R. 69, Art. 90; T. R. 74, Art. 91; T.R. 77, Art. 90. It appears with unimportant verbal differences in earlier regulations. T.R. 45, Art. 87, as amended by T.D. 3206, 5 Cum.Bul. 116. A claim existing 'unconditionally' would include a claim for interest on a bond or for rent under a lease. A claim existing conditionally can have no better illustration than is found in a claim to recover an infringer's profits. Cf.O.D. 917, 4 Cum.Bul. 142; O.D. 1141, 5 Cum.Bul. 134; S.M. 2285, III-2 Cum.Bul. 87, 89, 90, disapproving I.T. 1294, I-1 Cum.Bul. 111. Nor does the case for the government stand upon the regulations alone without confirmatory evidence. By clear implication the regulations have been ratified by Congress, which has passed revenue acts at frequent intervals thereafter without a sign of disapproval. 'Congress must be taken to have been familiar with the existing administrative interpretation.' McFeely v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 102\n, 56 S.Ct. 54, 57, Nov. 11, 1935; Zellerbach Paper Co. v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 172, 179\n, 180 S., 55 S.Ct. 127. Claims existing unconditionally before March 1, 1913, being thus excluded from the tax, the plain meaning of the regulation is that conditional or contingent claims, though they may have had an inchoate existence before March 1, 1913, are to be taxed when they are shorn of their conditional or contingent quality and become unconditional or absolute. So far as the problem to be solved depends upon the intention of the Congress in the enactment of the statute, the result is hardly doubtful. \n\n[297 U.S. 88, 96]\n\u00a0\n Whatever obscurity exists has its origin, one may believe, in a not uncommon confusion of the rule with the exception. There is a tendency now and again to look upon March 1, 1913 as fixing a point of time when claims of every kind, no matter how contingent, became transmuted into capital, at least for taxing purposes. This is far from the truth, as the acceptance by Congress of the foregoing regulations sufficiently attests. The intention has rather been that, with exceptions specially declared or dependent upon considerations of established methods of accounting, every form of income accruing fully or unconditionally after February, 1913, shall contribute to the Treasury, though it had a potential existence for years before its capacity to fructify. As already suggested, perception of this intention has been clouded by exceptions, actual or seeming, which have been so insulated and emphasized as to be taken for the rule itself. Thus, Congress has now provided (see, e.g., Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463,  2(a), 39 Stat. 756, 757; Revenue Act of 1921, c. 135,  201, 42 Stat. 224, 228; Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27,  201, 44 Stat. 9, 10, 26 U.S.C.A.  115 note) that dividends may be distributed exempt from the tax to the extent that they are made out of earnings or profits accumulated before March 1, 1913. The exemption is 'a concession to the equity of stockholders' (Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339, 346\n, 38 S.Ct. 543, 546; Helvering v. Canfield, \n291 \nU.S. 163, 167\n, 54 S.Ct. 368), and had no existence under the pioneer statute, the Act of 1913, a dividend, irrespective of its source, being then taxable altogether. Lynch v. Hornby, supra. So Congress has now provided (see, e.g., Revenue Act of 1924, c. 232, 43 Stat. 253, 259,  204(b), 26 U.S.C.A.  113 note; Revenue Act of 1926, supra,  204(b), 44 Stat. 16, 26 U.S.C.A.  113 note) that in computing gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property acquired before March 1, 1913, the base shall be the cost or the value on that day, whichever is the greater. See, also, Revenue Act of 1916, supra ,  2(c), 39 Stat. 758; Revenue Act of 1921, supra, \n\n[297 U.S. 88, 97]\n\u00a0\n s 202(b)(1), 42 Stat. 229. Cf. Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 \nU.S. 509\n, 41 S.Ct. 386, 15 A.L.R. 1305; Goodrich v. Edwards, \n255 \nU.S. 527\n, 41 S.Ct. 390. We are not unmindful of cases in which a like formula was applied without the aid of statute. Lynch v. Turrish, \n247 \nU.S. 221\n, 38 S.Ct. 537; Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179\n, 38 S.Ct. 467; Hays v. Gauley Mt. Coal Co ., \n247 \nU.S. 189\n, 38 S.Ct. 470, and cf. MacLaughlin v. Alliance Insurance Co., \n286 \nU.S. 244, 251\n, 52 S.Ct. 538. They do not rule the case at hand. In those cases and others like them assets that were capital in February, 1913, had been converted into cash thereafter. Coal lands and timber lands and timber had been sold by an owner in the ordinary course of business. By the practice of merchants a stock in trade is capital according to its inventory value. Hays v. Gauley Mt. Coal Co., supra, \n247 U.S. 189\n, at page 193, 38 S.Ct. 470. Nothing of the kind is here. The case is not helped by speaking of the claim as 'property.' The question is whether it is property that has been transmuted into capital. In February, 1913, the chose in action now assessed was not a part of the respondent's capital as merchants or other business men would understand the term. Cf. North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet, supra. At best, it was contingent income, the income of the future. It had no inventory value, much less a value quoted in the market. Whether it would ever be worth anything was still unknown and unknowable. The answer was not given for many years thereafter.\n The argument is pressed upon us that the claim collected by the respondent is to be viewed as one for damages rather than as one for profits, and that in the aspect of a claim for damages it had a 'market value' ascertainable at the commencement of the suit and later. There are two reasons, if not more, why the argument must fail. In the first place, the respondent made an election to abandon any claim for damages and to confine itself to the profits received by the infringer. The amount of these profits was unknown at the commencement of the \n\n[297 U.S. 88, 98]\n\u00a0\n suit and must needs have remained unknown in advance of an accounting. To determine what the respondent got, we are to consider what it did, and not what it could have had if it had made another choice. In the second place, a claim for damages like one for an infringer's profits is too contingent and uncertain to have a determinable market value when the validity of the patent is unsettled, and contested and the factors making up the damage are arrived at by conjecture. Sinclair Refining Co. v. Jenkins Petroleum Process Co., \n289 \nU.S. 689, 697\n, 53 S.Ct. 736, 88 A.L.R. 496; Cf. Heiner v. Crosby (C.C.A.) 24 F.(2d) 191; Walter v. Duffy (C.C.A.) 287 F. 41. There is significance in the fact that the estimate of the damage in the claim filed with the Commissioner exceeded by nearly $300,000 the estimate of the damage accepted at the trial.\n The case comes down to this: On February 28, 1913, the respondent had a contested claim for profits which if prosecuted effectively would ripen into income. That claim would not have been capital if it had been acquired for the first time on March 1, 1913. It was not turned into capital because it had been acquired earlier. Edwards v. Keith (D.C.) 224 F. 585; Id. (D.C.A.) 231 F. 110; Workman v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 41 F.(2d) 139. Before March 1, 1913, and afterwards, it was continuously the same thing until reduced to judgment and collected. The case is not to be confused with one where the basis of the suit is an injury to capital, with the result that the recovery is never income, no matter when collected. Examples of such a claim are Saunders v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 29 F.(2d) 834, and Heiner v. Hewes (C.C.A) 30 F.(2d) 787, cited by the taxpayer. Buffalo Union Furnace Co. v. Helvering (C.C.A.) 72 F.(2d) 399, is perhaps upon the border line, the claim being not for profits, but for r covery of out of pocket expenses. Confining it to its peculiar facts, we do not read it as inconsistent with the views herein expressed.\n Second. Congress was not restrained by express or implied restrictions of the Federal Constitution from giving \n\n[297 U.S. 88, 99]\n\u00a0\n effect to its intention and levying a tax upon the proceeds of the settlement.\n In February, 1913, if our analysis of the facts is accurate, there was a contested and contingent claim for profits, not fairly to be characterized as income for that year or earlier. In 1925, this inchoate and disputed claim became consummate and established. It was now something more than a claim. It was income fully accrued, and taxable as such. Till then the patentee had its capital, the patent, and an expectancy of income, or income, more accurately, in the process of becoming. Thereafter it had something different. No doubt the income thus accrued derived sustenance and value from the soil of past events. We do not identify the seed with the fruit that it will yield.\n Income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment is the fruit that is born of capital, not the potency of fruition. With few exceptions, if any, it is income as the word is known in the common speech of men. Lynch v. Hornby, supra, \n247 U.S. 339\n, page 344, 38 S.Ct. 543. When it is that, it may be taxed, though it was in the making long before. MacLaughlin v. Alliance Ins. Co., supra, \n286 U.S. 244\n, at pages 249, 250, 52 S.Ct. 538; Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470\n, 49 S. Ct. 199, 64 A.L.R. 362; Helvering v. Canfield, supra. Cf. Lucas v. Alexander, \n279 \nU.S. 573, 577\n, 578 S., 49 S.Ct. 426, 61 A.L.R. 906; Towne v. Eisner, \n245 \nU.S. 418\n, 38 S.Ct. 158, L.R. A.1918D, 254; Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 206\n, 207 S., 40 S.Ct. 189, 9 A.L.R. 1570. If exceptions are to be allowed in exceptional conditions, they are inapplicable here.\n Third. The taxpayer is not entitled to a deduction on the basis of a difference between the value of the chose in action on March 1, 1913, or at any other time and the proceeds of collection.\n\n\n (a)\n At the time of the settlement, the amount of the infringer's liability was contested as it had been before, the outcome of the contest being uncertain as long as the appeal was pending. The respondent chose to forego a large portion of the judgment in the belief that com- \n\n[297 U.S. 88, 100]\n\u00a0\n promise was prudent. For all that appears, if compromise had been rejected, the judgment would have been so reduced as to make the recovery even less. True the respondent insists that the fear of a reduction was not the motive for the settlement. The motive is said to have been the fear that the judgment, even if not reduced, might not be susceptible of collection. On the other hand, the infringer may have viewed the prospects differently. We have no means of ascertaining whose forecast was the better. What we know is that there was a compromise through which patentee and infringer surrendered rights and opportunities.\n\n\n (b)\n The value of the chose in action, uncertain at the time of settlement, was even more uncertain in February, 1913. Unpredictable vicissitudes might reduce it to a nullity. The patent might be adjudged invalid. The infringer might become insolvent. In the earlier years, as in the later ones, the supposed profits of the business might have evaporated as the result of neglect or incapacity. Not till the report by the master and its confirmation by the court could the recovery be estimated with even approximate correctness. There is no contention by the respondent that the value of the judgment was greater at that time than it was a few months later at the date of the settlement in the face of an appeal.\n The conclusion is inescapable that the acceptance of the settlement did not involve a loss of income, still less a loss of capital.\n Fourth. The taxpayer is not entitled to a refund of the proportion of the settlement attributable to the profits of the infringer before the effective date of the Sixteenth Amendment.\n This conclusion follows without need for elaboration from what has been said in this opinion as to the distinction between capital and income.\n The judgments are reversed. \n\n[297 U.S. 88, 101]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and Mr. Justice ROBERTS are of opinion that the judgments should be affirmed. The claim or respondent was a valid one, constituting property prior to March 1, 1913. It not only had an ascertainable value at that time, but a value which was actually ascertained and found as a fact by the trial judge and affirmed by the court below. Since there is evidence in the record to support these concurrent findings, we are not at liberty to set them aside. The case clearly falls within the principle of Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179\n, 38 S.Ct. 467; Lucas v. Alexander, \n279 \nU.S. 573\n, 49 S.Ct. 426, 61 A.L.R. 906, and other cases which might be cited. Certainly promissory notes, bonds, shares of stock, and valid claims arising upon contract or in tort may be capital as distinguished from income, quite as much as a stock of goods or other tangible property. And quite as certainly, it is not necessary that these intangibles should have a market value or an inventory value. It is enough that they have an ascertainable value at the statutory time fixed. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

United States, \n294 \nU.S. 435\n, 55 S.Ct. 440. The challenged holding is that there is statutory authority for including in contracts of United States government insurance (converted war risk insurance) covering death or total permanent disability a provision that 'the permanent loss of hearing of both ears ... shall be deemed to be total disability.' The case was tried in the District Court to a jury which rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, respondent here. Judgment in his favor was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 76 F.(2d) 564, which held that the insertion in the policy of the quoted definition of total disability, pursuant to Veterans' Administration Regulation,  3122, was authorized by 43 Stat. 624, 1309, 38 U.S.C.  512 (38 U.S.C.A.  512).1\n The government, by its assignment of errors here, assails, as it did in the court below, the correctness of \n\n[297 U.S. 157, 159]\n\u00a0\n this ruling, but examination of the record discloses that no such objection was presented to the trial court. In consequence the government is precluded from raising the question on appeal.\n The trial judge instructed the jury that respondent might recover either on the theory that his loss of hearing constituted in fact a permanent disability preventing his pursuit of any substantially gainful occupation, or that his loss of hearing of both ears, if permanent, was a permanent disability as defined by the policy. The jury was thus left free to return a verdict for respondent if it found that he had suffered permanent loss of hearing of both ears, regardless of its effect upon his ability to earn his livelihood. The government failed to question the correctness of these instructions either by exception or request to charge, and its motion for a directed verdict was upon other grounds not now material.\n The verdict of a jury will not ordinarily be set aside for error not brought to the attention of the trial court. This practice is founded upon considerations of fairness to the court and to the parties and of the public interest in bringing litigation to an end after fair opportunity has been afforded to present all issues of law and fact.

Section 1 (7 U.S.C.A.  601) recites that an economic emergency has arisen, due to disparity between the prices of agricultural and other commodities, with consequent destruction of farmers' purchasing power and breakdown in orderly exchange, which, in turn, have affected transactions in agricultural commodities with a national public interest and burdened and obstructed the normal currents of commerce, calling for the enactment of legislation. \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 54]\n\u00a0\n Section 2 (7 U.S.C.A.  602) declares it to be the policy of Congress:\n'To establish and maintain such balance between the production and consumption of agricultural commodities, and such marketing conditions therefor, as will reestablish prices to farmers at a level that will give agricultural commodities2 a purchasing power with respect to articles that farmers buy, equivalent to the purchasing power of agricultural commodities in the base period.'\n\n The base period, in the case of cotton, and all other commodities except tobacco, is designated as that between August, 1909, and July, 1914\n\n\n The further policies announced are an approach to the desired equality by gradual correction of present inequalities 'at as rapid a rate as is deemed feasible in view of the current consumptive demand in domestic and foreign markets,' and the protection of consumers' interest by readjusting farm production at such level as will not increase the percentage of the consumers' retail expenditures for agricultural commodities or products derived therefrom, which is returned to the farmer, above the percentage returned to him in the base period.\n Section 8 (48 Stat. 34) provides, amongst other things, that, 'In order to effectuate the declared policy,' the Secretary of Agriculture shall have power\n'(1) To provide for reduction in the acreage or reduction in the production for market, or both, of any basic agricultural commodity, through agreements with producers or by other voluntary methods, and to provide for rental or benefit payments in connection therewith or upon that part of the production of any basic agricultural commodity required for domestic consumption, in such amounts as the Secretary deems fair and reasonable, to \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 55]\n\u00a0\n be paid out of any moneys available for such payments. ...\n\n'(2) To enter into marketing agreements with processors, associations of producers, and others engaged in the handling, in the current of interstate or foreign commerce of any agricultural commodity or product thereof, after due notice and opportunity for hearing to interested parties. ...\n\n'(3) To issue licenses permitting processors, associations of producers, and others to engage in the handling, in the current of interstate or foreign commerce, of any agricultural commodity or product thereof, or any competing commodity or product thereof.'\n\n It will be observed that the Secretary is not required, but is permitted, if, in his uncontrolled judgment, the policy of the act will so be promoted, to make agreements with individual farmers for a reduction of acreage or production upon such terms as he may think fair and reasonable.\n Section 9(a), 48 Stat. 35 enacts:\n'To obtain revenue for extraordinary expenses incurred by reason of the national economic emergency, there shall be levied processing taxes as hereinafter provided. When the Secretary of Agriculture determines that rental or benefit payments are to be made with respect to any basic agricultural commodity, he shall proclaim such determination, and a processing tax shall be in effect with respect to such commodity from the beginning of the marketing year therefor next following the date of such proclamation. The processing tax shall be levied, assessed, and collected upon the first domestic proc ssing of the commodity, whether of domestic production or imported, and shall be paid by the processor.'\n\n The Secretary may from time to time, if he finds it necessary for the effectuation of the policy of the act, readjust the amount of the exaction to meet the require- \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 56]\n\u00a0\n ments of subsection (b). The tax is to terminate at the end of any marketing year if the rental or benefit payments are discontinued by the Secretary with the expiration of that year.\n Section 9(b), 7 U.S.C.A.  609(b), fixes the tax 'at such rate as equals the difference between the current average farm price for the commodity and the fair exchange value,' with power in the Secretary, after investigation, notice, and hearing, to readjust the tax so as to prevent the accumulation of surplus stocks and depression of farm prices.\n Section 9(c), 7 U.S.C.A.  609(c), directs that the fair exchange value of a commodity shall be such a price as will give that commodity the same purchasing power with respect to articles farmers buy as it had during the base period, and that the fair exchange value and the current average farm price of a commodity shall be ascertained by the Secretary from available statistics in his department.\n Section 12(a), 7 U.S.C.A.  612(a), appropriates $100,000,000 'to be available to the Secretary of Agriculture for administrative expenses under this title (chapter) and for rental and benefit payments;' and Section 12(b), 7 U.S.C.A.  612(b), appropriates the proceeds derived from all taxes imposed under the act 'to be available to the Secretary of Agriculture for expansion of markets and removal of surplus agricultural products. ... Administrative expenses, rental and benefit payments, and refunds on taxes.'\n Section 15(d), 7 U.S.C.A.  615(d), permits the Secretary, upon certain conditions, to impose compensating taxes on commodities in competition with those subject to the processing tax.\n By section 16 (see 7 U.S.C.A.  616) a floor tax is imposed upon the sale or other disposition of any article processed wholly or in chief value from any commodity with respect to which a processing tax is to be levied in amount equivalent to that of the processing tax which would be payable with respect to the commodity from which the article is processed if the processing had occurred on the date when the processing tax becomes effective. \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 57]\n\u00a0\n On July 14, 1933, the Secretary of Agriculture, with the approval of the President, proclaimed that he had determined rental and benefit payments should be made with respect to cotton; that the marketing year for that commodity was to begin August 1, 1933; and calculated and fixed the rates of processing and floor taxes on cotton in accordance with the terms of the act.\n The United States presented a claim to the respondents as receivers of the Hoosac Mills Corporation for processing and floor taxes on cotton levied under sections 9 and 16 of the act. The receivers recommended that the claim be disallowed. The District Court found the taxes valid and ordered them paid. 3 Upon appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order. \n4\n The judgment under review was entered prior to the adoption of the amending act of August 24, 1935,5 and we are therefore concerned only with the original act.\n First. At the outset the United States contends that the respondents have no standing to question the validity of the tax. The position is that the act is merely a revenue measure levying an excise upon the activity of processing cotton-a proper subject for the imposition of such a tax-the proceeds of which go into the federal Treasury and thus become available for appropriation for any purpose. It is said that what the respondents are endeavoring to do is to challenge the intended use of the money pursuant to Congressional appropriation when, by con ession, that money will have become the property of the government and the taxpayer will no longer have any interest in it. Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447\n, 43 S.Ct. 597, is claimed to foreclose litigation by the respondents or other taxpayers, as such, looking to restraint of the expenditure of government funds. That case might be an authority \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 58]\n\u00a0\n in the petitioners' favor if we were here concerned merely with a suit by a taxpayer to restrain the expenditure of the public moneys. It was there held that a taxpayer of the United States may not question expenditures from its treasury on the ground that the alleged unlawful diversion will deplete the public funds and thus increase the burden of future taxation. Obviously the asserted interest of a taxpayer in the federal government's funds and the supposed increase of the future burden of taxation is minute and indeterminable. But here the respondents who are called upon to pay moneys as taxes, resist the exaction as a step in an unauthorized plan. This circumstance clearly distinguishes the case. The government in substance and effect asks us to separate the Agricultural Adjustment Act into two statutes, the one levying an excise on processors of certain commodities; the other appropriating the public moneys independently of the first. Passing the novel suggestion that two statutes enacted as parts of a single scheme should be tested as if they were distinct and unrelated, we think the legislation now before us is not susceptible of such separation and treatment.\n The tax can only be sustained by ignoring the avowed purpose and operation of the act, and holding it a measure merely laying an excise upon processors to raise revenue for the support of government. Beyond cavil the sole object of the legislation is to restore the purchasing power of agricultural products to a parity with that prevailing in an earlier day; to take money from the processor and bestow it upon farmers6 who will reduce their acreage for \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 59]\n\u00a0\n the accomplishment of the proposed end, and, meanwhile, to aid these farmers during the period required to bring the prices of their crops to the desired level.\n The tax plays an indispensable part in the plan of regulation. As stated by the Agricultural Adjustment Administrator, it is 'the heart of the law'; a means of 'accomplishing one or both of two things intended to help farmers attain parity prices and purchasing power.' \n7\n A tax automatically goes into effect for a commodity when the Secretary of Agriculture determines that rental or benefit payments are to be made for reduction of production of that commodity. The tax is to cease when rental or benefit payments cease. The rate is fixed with the purpose of bringing about crop reduction and price raising. It is to equal the difference between the 'current average farm price' and 'fair exchange value.' It may be altered to such amount as will prevent accumulation of surplus stocks. If the Secretary finds the policy of the act will not be promoted by the levy of the tax for a given commodity, he may exempt it. Section 11. The whole revenue from the levy is appropriated in aid of crop control; none of it is made available for general governmental use. The entire agricultural adjustment program embodied in title 1 of the act is to become inoperative when, in the judgment of the President, the national economic emergency ends; and as to any commodity he may terminate the provisions of the law, if he finds them no longer requisite to carrying out the declared policy with re pect to such commodity. Section 13, see 7 U.S.C.A.  613.\n The statute not only avows an aim foreign to the procurement of revenue for the support of government, but by its operation shows the exaction laid upon processors to be the necessary means for the intended control of agricultural production. \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 60]\n\u00a0\n In these aspects the tax, co-called, closely resembles that laid by the Act of August 3, 1882 (22 Stat. 314), entitled 'An Act to Regulate Immigration,' which came before this court in the Head Money Cases, \n112 \nU.S. 580\n, 5 S.Ct. 247. The statute directed that there should be levied, collected, and paid a duty of 50 cents for each alien passenger who should come by vessel from a foreign port to one in the United States. Payment was to be made to the collector of the port by the master, owner, consignee, or agent of the ship; the money was to be paid into the Treasury, was to be called the immigrant fund, and to be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to defray the expense of regulating immigration, for the care of immigrants, and relieving those in distress, and for the expenses of effectuating the act.\n Various objections to the act were presented. In answering them the court said (\n112 U.S. 580\n, page 595, 5 S.Ct. 247, 252):\n'But the true answer to all these objections is that the power exercised in this instance is not the taxing power. The burden imposed on the ship-owner by this statute is the mere incident of the regulation of commerce-of that branch of foreign commerce which is involved in immigration. ...\n\n'It is true, not much is said about protecting the ship-owner. But he is the man who reaps the profit from the transaction. ... The sum demanded of him is not, therefore, strictly speaking, a tax or duty within the meaning of the constitution. The money thus raised, though paid into the treasury, is appropriated in advance to the uses of the statute, and does not go to the general support of the government.'\n\n While there the exaction was sustained as an appropriate element in a plan within the power of Congress 'to regulate commerce with foreign nations,' no question was made of the standing of the shipowner to raise the ques- \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 61]\n\u00a0\n tion of the validity of the scheme, and consequently of the exaction which was an incident of it.\n It is inaccurate and misleading to speak of the exaction from processors prescribed by the challenged act as a tax, or to say that as a tax it is subject to no infirmity. A tax, in the general understanding of the term, and as used in the Constitution, signifies an exaction for the support of the government. The word has never been thought to connote the expropriation of money from one group for the benefit of another. We may concede that the latter sort of imposition is constitutional when imposed to effectuate regulation of a matter in which both groups are interested and in respect of which there is a power of legislative regulation. But manifestly no justification for it can be found unless as an integral part of such regulation. The exaction cannot be wrested out of its setting, denominated an excise for raising revenue, and legalized by ignoring its purpose as a mere instrumentality for bringing about a desired end. To do this would be to shut our eyes to what all others than we can see and understand. Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20, 37\n, 42 S.Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432.\n We conclude that the act is one regulating agricultural production; that the tax is a mere incident of such regulation; and that the respondents have standing to challenge the legality of the exaction.\n It does not follow that, as the act is not an exertion of the taxing power and the exaction not a true tax, the statute is void or the exaction uncollectible. For, to paraphrase what was said in the Head Money Cases, supra, \n112 U.S. 580\n, page 596, 5 S.Ct. 247, 252, if this is an expedient regulation by Congress, f a subject within one of its granted powers, 'and the end to be attained powers, within that power, the act is not void because, within a loose and more extended sense than was used in the constitution,' the exaction is called a tax. \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 62]\n\u00a0\n Second. The government asserts that even if the respondents may question the propriety of the appropriation embodied in the statute, their attack must fail because article 1,  8 of the Constitution, authorizes the contemplated expenditure of the funds raised by the tax. This contention presents the great and the controlling question in the case. \n8\n We approach its decision with a sense of our grave responsibility to render judgment in accordance with the principles established for the governance of all three branches of the government.\n There should be no misunderstanding as to the function of this court in such a case. It is sometimes said that the court assumes a power to overrule or control the action of the people's representatives. This is a misconception. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land ordained and established by the people. All legislation must conform to the principles it lays down. When an act of Congress is appropriately challenged in the courts as not conforming to the constitutional mandate, the judicial branch of the government has only one duty; to lay the article of the Constitution which is invoked beside the statute which is challenged and to decide whether the latter squares with the former. All the court does, or can do, is to announce its considered judgment upon the ques- \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 63]\n\u00a0\n tion. The only power it has, if such it may be called, is the power of judgment. This court neither approves nor condemns any legislative policy. Its delicate and difficult office is to ascertain and declare whether the legislation is in accordance with, or in contravention of, the provisions of the Constitution; and, having done that, its duty ends. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The question is not what power the federal government ought to have, but what powers in fact have been given by the people. It hardly seems necessary to reiterate that ours is a dual form of government; that in every state there are two governments; the state and the United States. Each state has all governmental powers save such as the people, by their Constitution, have conferred upon the United States, denied to the states, or reserved to themselves. The federal union is a government of delegated powers. It has only such as are expressly conferred upon it and such as are reasonably to be implied from those granted. In this respect we differ radically from nations where all legislative power, without restriction or limitation, is vested in a parliament or other legislative body subject to no restrictions except the discretion of its members.\n Article 1,  8, of the Constitution, vests sundry powers in the Congress. But two of its clauses have any bea ing upon the validity of the statute under review.\n The third clause endows the Congress with power 'to regulate Commerce ... among the several States.' Despite a reference in its first section to a burden upon, and an obstruction of the normal currents of, commerce, the act under review does not purport to regulate transactions in interstate or foreign10 commerce. Its stated pur- \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 64]\n\u00a0\n pose is the control of agricultural production, a purely local activity, in an effort to raise the prices paid the farmer. Indeed, the government does not attempt to uphold the validity of the act on the basis of the commerce clause, which, for the purpose of the present case, may be put aside as irrelevant.\n The clause thought to authorize the legislation, the first, confers upon the Congress power 'to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States. ...' It is not contended that this provision grants power to regulate agricultural production upon the theory that such legislation would promote the general welfare. The government concedes that the phrase 'to provide for the general welfare' qualifies the power 'to lay and collect taxes.' The view that the clause grants power to provide for the general welfare, independently of the taxing power, has never been authoritatively accepted. Mr. Justice Story points out that, if it were adopted, 'it is obvious that under color of the generality of the words, to 'provide for the common defence and general welfare', the government of the United States is, in reality, a government of general and unlimited powers, notwithstanding the subsequent enumeration of specific powers.' \n11\n The true construction undoubtedly is that the only thing granted is the power to tax for the purpose of providing funds for payment of the nation's debts and making provision for the general welfare.\n Nevertheless, the government asserts that warrant is found in this clause for the adoption of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The argument is that Congress may appropriate and authorize the spending of moneys for the 'general welfare'; that the phrase should be liberally \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 65]\n\u00a0\n construed to cover anything conducive to national welfare; that decision as to what will promote such welfare rests with Congress alone, and the courts may not review its determination; and, finally, that the appropriation under attack was in fact for the general welfare of the United States.\n The Congress is expressly empowered to lay taxes to provide for the general welfare. Funds in the Treasury as a result of taxation may be expended only through appropriation. Article 1,  9, cl. 7. They can never accomplish the objects for which they were collected, unless the power to appropriate is as broad as the power to tax. The necessary implication from the terms of the grant is that the public funds may be appropriated 'to provide for the general welfare of the United States.' These words cannot be meaningless, else they would not have been used. The conclusion must be that they were intended to limit and define the granted power to raise and to expend money. How shall they be construed to effectuate the intent of the instrument?\n Since the foundation of the nation, sharp differences of opinion have persisted as to the true interpretation of the phrase. Madison asserted it amounted to no more than a reference to the other powers enumerated in the subsequent clauses of the same section; that, as the United States is a government of limited and enumerated powers, the grant of power to tax and spend for the general national welfare must be confined to the enumerated legislative fields committed to the Congress. In this view the phrase is mere tautology, for taxation and appropriation are or may be necessary incidents of the exercise of any of the enumerated legislative powers. Hamilton, on the other hand, maintained the clause confers a power separate and distinct from those later enumerated is not restricted in meaning by the grant of them, and Congress consequently has a substantive power to tax and to ap- \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 66]\n\u00a0\n propriate, limited only by the requirement that it shall be exercised to provide for the general welfare of the United States. Each contention has had the support of those whose views are entitled to weight. This court has noticed the question, but has never found it necessary to decide which is the true construction. Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries, espouses the Hamiltonian position. \n12\n We shall not review the writings of public men and commentators or discuss the legislative practice. Study of all these leads us to conclude that the reading advocated by Mr. Justice Story is the correct one. While, therefore, the power to tax is not unlimited, its confines are set in the clause which confers it, and not in those of section 8 which bestow and define the legislative powers of the Congress. It results that the power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution.\n But the adoption of the broader construction leaves the power to spend subject to limitations.\n As Story says: 'The Constitution was, from its very origin, contemplated to be the frame of a national government, of special and enumerated powers, and not of general and unlimited powers.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Again he says: 'A power to lay taxes for the common defence and general welfare of the United States is not in common sense a general power. It is limited to those objects. It cannot constitutionally transcend them.' \n14\n\u00a0\n\n That the qualifying phrase must be given effect all advocates of broad construction admit. Hamilton, in his \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 67]\n\u00a0\n well known Report on Manufactures, states that the purpose must be 'general, and not local.' \n15\n Monroe, an advocate of Hamilton's doctrine, wrote: 'Have Congress a right to raise and appropriate the money to any and to every purpose according to their will and pleasure? They certainly have not.' \n16\n Story says that if the tax be not proposed for the common defense or general welfare, but for other objects wholly extraneous, it would be wholly indefensible upon constitutional principles. \n17\n And he makes it clear that the powers of taxation and appropriation extend only to matters of national, as distinguished from local, welfare.\n As elsewhere throughout the Constitution the section in question lays down principles which control the use of the power, and does not attempt meticulous or detailed directions. Every presumption is to be indulged in favor of faithful compliance by Congress with the mandates of the fundamental law. Courts are reluctant to adjudge any statute in contravention of them. But, under our frame of government, no other place is provided where the citizen may be heard to urge that the law fails to conform to the limits set upon the use of a granted power. When such a contention comes here we naturally require a showing that by no reasonable possibility can the challenged legislation fall within the wide range of discretion permitted to the Congress. How great is the extent of that range, when the subject is the promotion of the general welfare of the United States, we need hardly remark. But, despite the breadth of the legislative discretion, our duty to hear and to render judgment remains. If the statute plainly violates the stated principle of the Constitution we must so declare. \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 68]\n\u00a0\n We are not now required to ascertain the scope of the phrase 'general welfare of the United States' or to determine whether an appropriation in aid of agriculture falls within it. Wholly apart from that question, another principle embedded in our Constitution prohibits the enforcement of the Agricultural adjustment Act. The act invades the reserved rights of the states. It is a statutory plan to regulate and control agricultural production, a matter beyond the powers delegated to the federal government. The tax, the appropriation of the funds raised, and the direction for their disbursement, are but parts of the plan. They are but means to an unconstitutional end.\n From the accepted doctrine that the United States is a government of delegated powers, it follows that those not expressly granted, or reasonably to be implied from such as are conferred, are reserved to the states or to the people. To forestall any suggestion to the contrary, the Tenth Amendment was adopted. \n18\n The same proposition, otherwise stated, is that powers not granted are prohibited. None to regulate agricultural production is given, and therefore legislation by Congress for that purpose is forbidden.\n It is an established principle that the attainment of a prohibited end may not be accomplished under the pretext of the exertion of powers which are granted.\n'Should congress, in the execution of its powers, adopt measures which are prohibited by the constitution; or should congress, under the pretext of executing its powers, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the government; it would become the painful duty of this tribunal, should a case requiring such a de- \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 69]\n\u00a0\n cision come before it, to say, that such an act was not the law of the land.' McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 423.\n\n'Congress cannot, under the pretext of executing delegated power, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the federal government. And we accept as established doctrine that any provision of an act of Congress ostensibly enacted under power granted by the Constitution, not naturally and reasonably adapted to the effective exercise of such power, but solely to the achievement of something plainly within power reserved to the states, is invalid and cannot be enforced.' Linder v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 5, 17\n, 45 S.Ct. 446, 449, 39 A.L.R. 229.\n\n These principles are as applicable to the power to lay taxes as to any other federal power. Said the court, in McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 4 Wheat. 316, 421: 'Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.'\n The power of taxation, which is expressly granted, may, of course, be adopted as a means to carry into operation another power also expressly granted. But resort to the taxing power to effectuate an end which is not legitimate, not within the scope of the Constitution, is obviously inadmissible.\n'Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the states.' Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 199.\n\n'There are, indeed, certain virtual limitations, arising from the principles of the Constitution itself. It would undoubtedly be an abuse of the (taxing) power if so exercised as to impair the separate existence and independent self-government of the States, or if exercised for ends \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 70]\n\u00a0\n inconsistent with the limited grants of power in the Constitution.' Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 541.\n\n In the Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S.Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432, and in Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44\n, 42 S.Ct. 453, this court had before it statutes which purported to be taxing measures. But their purpose was found to be to regulate the conduct of manufacturing and trading, not in interstate commerce, but in the states- matters not within any power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution- and the levy of the tax a means to force compliance. The court held this was not a constitutional use, but an unconstitutional abuse of the power to tax. In Linder v. United States, supra, we held that the power to tax could not justify the regulation of the practice of a profession, under the pretext of raising revenue. In United States v. Constantine, \n296 \nU.S. 287\n, 56 S.Ct. 223, we declared that Congress could not, in the guise of a tax, impose sanctions for violation of state law respecting the local sale of liquor. These decisions demonstrate that Congress could not, under the pretext of raising revenue, lay a tax on processors who refuse to pay a certain price for cotton and exempt those who agree so to do, with the purpose of benefiting producers.\n Third. If the taxing power may not be used as the instrument to enforce a regulation of matters of state concern with respect to which the Congress has no authority to interfere, may it, as in the present case, be employed to raise the money necessary to purchase a compliance which the Congress is powerless to command? The government asserts that whatever might be said against the validity of the plan, if compulsory, it is constitutionally sound because the end is accomplished by voluntary co- operation. There are two sufficient answers to the contention. The regulation is not in fact voluntary. The farmer, of course, may refuse to comply, but the price of such refusal is the loss of benefits. The amount offered is intended to be sufficient to exert pressure on him to \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 71]\n\u00a0\n agree to the proposed regulation. \n19\n The power to confer or withhold unlimited benefits is the power to coerce or destroy. If the cotton grower elects not to accept the benefits, he will receive less for his crops; those who receive payments will be able to undersell him. The result may well to financial ruin. The coercive purpose and intent of the statute is not obscured by the fact that it has not been perfectly successful. It is pointed out that, because there still remained a minority whom the rental and benefit payments were insufficient to induce to surrender their independence of action, the Congress has gone further, and, in the Bankhead Cotton Act, used the taxing power in a more directly minatory fashion to compel submission. This progression only serves more fully to expose the coercive purpose of the so-called tax imposed by the present act. It is clear that the Department of Agriculture has properly described the plan as one to keep a nonco-operating minority in line. This is coercion by economic pressure. The asserted power of choice is illusory.\n In Frost & Frost Trucking Company v. R.R. Commission, \n271 \nU.S. 583\n, 46 S.Ct. 605, 47 A.L.R. 457, a state act was considered which provided for supervision and regulation of transportation for hire by automobile on the public highways. Certificates of convenience and necessity were to be obtained by persons desiring to use the highways for this purpose. The regulatory \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 72]\n\u00a0\n commission required that a private contract carrier should secure such a certificate as a condition of its operation. The effect of the commission's action was to transmute the private carrier into a public carrier. In other words, the privilege of using the highways as a private carrier for compensation was conditioned upon his dedicating his property to the quasi public use of public transportation. While holding that the private carrier was not obliged to submit himself to the condition, the commission denied him the privilege of using the highways if he did not do so. The argument was, as here, that the carrier had a free choice. This court said, in holding the act as construed unconstitutional: 'If so, constitutional guaranties, so carefully safeguarded against direct assault, are open to destruction by the indirect, but no less effective, process of requiring a surrender, which, though in form voluntary, in fact lacks none of the elements of compulsion. Having regard to form alone, the act here is an offer to the private carrier of a privilege, which the state may grant or deny, upon a condition which the carrier is free to accept or reject. In reality, the carrier is given no choice, except a choice between the rock and the whirlpool-an option to forego a privilege which may be vital to his livelihood or submit to a requirement which may constitute an intolerable burden.' \n271 U.S. 583\n, page 593, 46 S.Ct. 605, 607, 47 A.L.R. 457.\n But if the plan were one for purely voluntary co-operation it would stand no better so far as federal power is concerned. At best, it is a scheme for purchasing with federal funds submission to federal regulation of a subject reserved to the states.\n It is said that Congress has the undoubted right to appropriate money to executive officers for expenditure under contracts between the government and individuals; that much of the total expenditures is so made. But appropriations and expenditures under contracts for proper \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 73]\n\u00a0\n governmental purposes cannot justify contracts which are not within federal power. And contracts for the reduction of acreage and the control of production are outside the range of that power. An appropriation to be expended by the United States under contracts calling for violation of a state law clearly would offend the Constitution. Is a statute less objectionable which authorizes expenditure of federal moneys to induce action in a field in which the United States has no power to intermeddle? The Congress cannot invade state jurisdiction to compel individual action; no more can it purchase such action.\n We are referred to numerous types of federal appropriation which have been made in the past, and it is asserted no question has been raised as to their validity. We need not stop to examine or consider them. As was said in Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Mellon, supra (\n262 U.S. 447\n, page 487, 43 S.Ct. 597, 601): 'As an examination of the acts of Congress will disclose, a large number of statutes appropriating or involving the expenditure of moneys for nonfederal purposes have been enacted and carried into effect.'\n As the opinion points out, such expenditures have not been challenged because no remedy was open for testing their constitutionality in the courts.\n We are not here concerned with a conditional appropriation of money, nor with a provision that if certain conditions are not complied with the appropriation shall no longer be available. By the Agricultural Adjustment Act the amount of the tax is appropriated to be expended only in payment under contracts whereby the parties bind themselves to regulation by the federal government. There is an obvious difference between a statute stating the conditions upon which moneys shall be expended and one effective only upon assumption of a contractual obligation to submit to a regulation which otherwise could not be enforced. Many examples pointing the distinction might be cited. We are ref rred to appropriations in aid \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 74]\n\u00a0\n of education, and it is said that no one has doubted the power of Congress to stipulate the sort of education for which money shall be expended. But an appropriation to an educational institution which by its terms is to become available only if the beneficiary enters into a contract to teach doctrines subversive of the Constitution is clearly bad. An affirmance of the authority of Congress so to condition the expenditure of an appropriation would tend to nullify all constitutional limitations upon legislative power.\n But it is said that there is a wide difference in another respect, between compulsory regulation of the local affairs of a state's citizens and the mere making of a contract relating to their conduct; that, if any state objects, it may declare the contract void and thus prevent those under the state's jurisdiction from complying with its terms. The argument is plainly fallacious. The United States can make the contract only if the federal power to tax and to appropriate reaches the subject-matter of the contract. If this does reach the subject-matter, its exertion cannot be displaced by state action. To say otherwise is to deny the supremacy of the laws of the United States; to make them subordinate to those of a state. This would reverse the cardinal principle embodied in the Constitution and substitute one which declares that Congress may only effectively legislate as to matters within federal competence when the states do not dissent.\n Congress has no power to enforce its commands on the farmer to the ends sought by the Agricultural Adjustment Act. It must follow that it may not indirectly accomplish those ends by taxing and spending to purchase compliance. The Constitution and the entire plan of our government negative any such use of the power to tax and to spend as the act undertakes to authorize. It does not help to declare that local conditions throughout the nation have created a situation of national concern; for this \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 75]\n\u00a0\n is but to say that whenever there is a widespread similarity of local conditions, Congress may ignore constitutional limitations upon its own powers and usurp those reserved to the states. If, in lieu of compulsory regulation of subjects within the states' reserved jurisdiction, which is prohibited, the Congress could invoke the taxing and spending power as a means to accomplish the same end, clause 1 of section 8 of article 1 would become the instrument for total subversion of the governmental powers reserved to the individual states.\n If the act before us is a proper exercise of the federal taxing power, evidently the regulation of all industry throughout the United States may be accomplished by similar exercises of the same power. It would be possible to exact money from one branch of an industry and pay it to another branch in every field of activity which lies within the province of the states. The mere threat of such a procedure might well induce the surrender of rights and the compliance with federal regulation as the price of continuance in business. A few instances will illustrate the thought.\n Let us suppose Congress should determine that the farmer, the miner, or some other producer of raw materials is receiving too much for his products, with consequent depression of the processing industry and idleness of its employees. Though, by confession, there is no power vested in Congress to compel by statute a lowering of the prices of the raw material, the same result might be accomplished, if the questioned act be valid, by taxing the producer upon his output and appropriating the proceeds to the processors, either with or without conditions imposed as the consideration for payment of the subsidy.\n We have held in A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947, that Congress has no power to regulate wages and hours of labor in a local business. If the petitioner is right, this very end may be accomplished by \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 76]\n\u00a0\n a propriating money to be paid to employers from the federal treasury under contracts whereby they agree to comply with certain standards fixed by federal law or by contract.\n Should Congress ascertain that sugar refiners are not receiving a fair profit, and that this is detrimental to the entire industry, and in turn has its repercussions in trade and commerce generally, it might, in analogy to the present law, impose an excise of 2 cents a pound on every sale of the commodity and pass the funds collected to such refiners, and such only, as will agree to maintain a certain price.\n Assume that too many shoes are being manufactured throughout the nation; that the market is saturated, the price depressed, the factories running half time, the employees suffering. Upon the principle of the statute in question, Congress might authorize the Secretary of Commerce to enter into contracts with shoe manufacturers providing that each shall reduce his output, and that the United States will pay him a fixed sum proportioned to such reduction, the money to make the payments to be raised by a tax on all retail shoe dealers on their customers.\n Suppose that there are too many garment workers in the large cities; that this results in dislocation of the economic balance. Upon the principle contended for, an excise might be laid on the manufacture of all garments manufactured and the proceeds paid to those manufacturers who agree to remove their plants to cities having not more than a hundred thousand population. Thus, through the asserted power of taxation, the federal government, against the will of individual states, might completely redistribute the industrial population.\n A possible result of sustaining the claimed federal power would be that every business group which thought itself underprivileged might demand that a tax be laid on its vendors or vendees, the proceeds to be appropriated to the redress of its deficiency of income. \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 77]\n\u00a0\n These illustrations are given, not to suggest that any of the purposes mentioned are unworthy, but to demonstrate the scope of the principle for which the government contends; to test the principle by its applications; to point out that, by the exercise of the asserted power, Congress would, in effect, under the pretext of exercising the taxing power, in reality accomplish prohibited ends. It cannot be said that they envisage improbable legislation. The supposed cases are no more improbable than would the present act have been deemed a few years ago.\n Until recently no suggestion of the existence of any such power in the federal government has been advanced. The expressions of the framers of the Constitution, the decisions of this court interpreting that instrument and the writings of great commentators will be searched in vain for any suggestion that there exists in the clause under discussion or elsewhere in the Constitution, the authority whereby every provision and every fair, implication from that instrument may be subverted, the independence of the individual states obliterated, and the United States converted into a central government exercising uncontrolled police power in every state of the Union, superseding all local control or regulation of the affairs or concerns of the states.\n Hamilton himself, the leading advocate of broad interpretation of the power to tax and to appropriate for the general welfare, never suggested that any power granted by the Constitution could be used for the destruction of local self-government in the states. Story countenances no such doctrine. It seems never to have occurred to them, or to those who have agreed with them, that the general welfare of the United States ( which has aptly been termed 'an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States,') might be served by obliterating the constituent members of the Union. But to this fatal conclu- \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 78]\n\u00a0\n sion the doctrine contended for would inevitably lead. And its sole premise is that, though the makers of the Constitution, in erecting the ederal government, intended sedulously to limit and define its powers, so as to reserve to the states and the people sovereign power, to be wielded by the states and their citizens and not to be invaded by the United States, they nevertheless by a single clause gave power to the Congress to tear down the barriers, to invade the states' jurisdiction, and to become a parliament of the whole people, subject to no restrictions save such as are self-imposed. The argument, when seen in its true character and in the light of its inevitable results, must be rejected.\n Since, as we have pointed out, there was no power in the Congress to impose the contested exaction, it could not lawfully ratify or confirm what an executive officer had done in that regard. Consequently the Act of 1935,  30, adding section 21(b) to Act of May 12, 1933 (7 U.S.C.A.  623( b), does not affect the rights of the parties.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I think the judgment should be reversed.\n The present stress of widely held and strongly expressed differences of opinion of the wisdom of the Agricultural Adjustment Act makes it important, in the interest of clear thinking and sound result, to emphasize at the outset certain propositions which should have controlling influence in determining the validity of the act. They are:\n\n 1. \nThe power of courts to declare a statute unconstitutional is subject to two guiding principles of decision which ought never to be absent from judicial consciousness. One is that courts are concerned only with the power to enact statutes, not with their wisdom. The other is that while unconstitutional exercise of power \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 79]\n\u00a0\n by the executive and legislative branches of the government is subject to judicial restraint, the only check upon our own exercise of power is our own sense of self-restraint. For the removal of unwise laws from the statute books appeal lies, not to the courts, but to the ballot and to the processes of democratic government.\n\n 2. \nThe constitutional power of Congress to levy an excise tax upon the processing of agricultural products is not questioned. The present levy is held invalid, not for any want of power in Congress to lay such a tax to defray public expenditures, including those for the general welfare, but because the use to which its proceeds are put is disapproved.\n\n 3. \nAs the present depressed state of agriculture is nation wide in its extent and effects, there is no basis for saying that the expenditure of public money in aid of farmers is not within the specifically granted power of Congress to levy taxes to 'provide for the ... general welfare.' The opinion of the Court does not declare otherwise.\n\n 4. \nNo question of a variable tax fixed from time to time by fiat of the Secretary of Agriculture, or of unauthorized delegation of legislative power, is now presented. The schedule of rates imposed by the secretary in accordance with the original command of Congress has since been specifically adopted and confirmed by act of Congress, which has declared that it shall be the lawful tax. Act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 750, 7 U. S.C.A.  602 et seq. That is the tax which the government now seeks to collect. Any defects there may have been in the manner of laying the tax by the secretary have now been removed by the exercise of the power of Congress to pass a curative statute validating an intended, though defective, tax. United States v. Heinszen & Co., \n206 \nU.S. 370\n, 27 S.Ct. 742, 11 Ann.Cas. 688; Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409\n, 51 S.Ct. 186; cf. Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15\n, 51 S.Ct. 324. The Agricultural Adjustment Act as thus amended de- \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 80]\n\u00a0\n clares that none of its provisions shall fail because others are pronounced invalid.\n It is with these preliminary and hardly controverted matters in mind that we should direct our attention to the pivot on which the decision of the Court is made to turn. It is that a levy unquestionably with n the taxing power of Congress may be treated as invalid because it is a step in a plan to regulate agricultural production and is thus a forbidden infringement of state power. The levy is not any the less an exercise of taxing power because it is intended to defray an expenditure for the general welfare rather than for some other support of government. Nor is the levy and collection of the tax pointed to as effecting the regulation. While all federal taxes inevitably have some influence on the internal economy of the states, it is not contended that the levy of a processing tax upon manufacturers using agricultural products as raw material has any perceptible regulatory effect upon either their production or manufacture. The tax is unlike the penalties which were held invalid in the Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S.Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432, in Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44\n, 42 S.Ct. 453, in Linder v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 5, 17\n, 45 S.Ct. 446, 39 A.L.R. 229, and in United States v. Constantine, \n296 \nU.S. 287\n, 56 S.Ct. 223, because they were themselves the instruments of regulation by virtue of their coercive effect on matters left to the control of the states. Here regulation, if any there be, is accomplished not by the tax, but by the method by which its proceeds are expended, and would equally be accomplished by any like use of public funds, regardless of their source.\n The method may be simply stated. Out of the available fund payments are made to such farmers as are willing to curtail their productive acreage, who in fact do so and who in advance have filed their written undertaking to do so with the Secretary of Agriculture. In saying that this method of spending public moneys is an invasion of the reserved powers of the states, the Court does not assert \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 81]\n\u00a0\n that the expenditure of public funds to promote the general welfare is not a substantive power specifically delegated to the national government, as Hamilton and Story pronounced it to be. It does not deny that the expenditure of funds for the benefit of farmers and in aid of a program of curtailment of production of agricultural products, and thus of a supposedly better ordered national economy, is within the specifically granted power. But it is declared that state power is nevertheless infringed by the expenditure of the proceeds of the tax to compensate farmers for the curtailment of their cotton acreage. Although the farmer is placed under no legal compulsion to reduce acreage, it is said that the mere offer of compensation for so doing is a species of economic coercion which operates with the same legal force and effect as though the curtailment were made mandatory by act of Congress. In any event it is insisted that even though not coercive the expenditure of public funds to induce the recipients to curtail production is itself an infringement of state power, since the federal government cannot invade the domain of the states by the 'purchase' of performance of acts which it has no power to compel.\n Of the assertion that the payments to farmers are coercive, it is enough to say that no such contention is pressed by the taxpayer, and no such consequences were to be anticipated or appear to have resulted from the administration of the act. The suggestion of coercion finds no support in the record or in any data showing the actual operation of the act. Threat of loss, not hope of gain, is the essence of economic coercion. Members of a long-depressed industry have undoubtedly been tempted to curtail acreage by the hope of resulting better prices and by the proffered opportunity to obtain needed ready money. But there is nothing to indicate that those who accepted benefits were impelled by fear of lower prices if they did not accept, or that at any stage in the operation \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 82]\n\u00a0\n of the plan a farmer could say whether, apart from the certainty of cash payments at specified times, the advantage would lie with curtailment of production plus c mpensation, rather than with the same or increased acreage plus the expected rise in prices which actually occurred. Although the Agricultural Adjustment Act was put into operation in June, 1933, the official reports of the Department of Agriculture show that 6,343,000 acres of productive cotton land, 14 per cent. of the total, did not participate in the plan in 1934, and 2,790,000 acres, 6 per cent. of the total, did not participate in 1935. Of the total number of farms growing cotton, estimated at 1,500,000, 33 per cent. in 1934 and 13 per cent. in 1935 did not participate.\n It is significant that in the congressional hearings on the bill that became the Bankhead Act, 48 Stat. 598, 7 U.S.C.A.  701 et seq., as amended by Act of June 20, 1934, 48 Stat. 1184, 7 U.S.C.A.  725, which imposes a tax of 50 per cent. on all cotton produced in excess of limits prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture, there was abundant testimony that the restriction of cotton production attempted by the Agricultural Adjustment Act could not be secured without the coercive provisions of the Bankhead Act. See Hearing before Committee on Agriculture, U.S. Senate, on S. 1974, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.; Hearing before Committee on Agriculture, U.S. House of Representatives, on H.R. 8402, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. The Senate and House Committees so reported, Senate Report No. 283, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3; House Report No. 867, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3. The Report of the Department of Agriculture on the administration of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (February 15, 1934 to December 31, 1934), p. 50, points out that the Bankhead Act was passed in response to a strong sentiment in favor of mandatory production control 'that would prevent non-cooperating farmers from increasing their own plantings in order to capitalize upon the price advances that had resulted from the reductions made by contract \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 83]\n\u00a0\n signers.' 1 The presumption of constitutionality of a statute is not to be overturned by an assertion of its coercive effect which rests on nothing more substantial than groundless speculation.\n It is upon the contention that state power is infringed by purchased regulation of agricultural production that chief reliance is placed. It is insisted that, while the Constitution gives to Congress, in specific and unambiguous terms, the power to tax and spend, the power is subject to limitations which do not find their origin in any express provision of the Constitution and to which other expressly delegated powers are not subject.\n The Constitution requires that public funds shall be spent for a defined purpose, the promotion of the general welfare. Their expenditure usually involves payment on terms which will insure use by the selected recipients within the limits of the constitutional purpose. Expenditures would fail of their purpose and thus lose their constitutional sanction if the terms of payment were not such that by their influence on the action of the recipients the permitted end would be attained. The power of Congress to spend is inseparable from persuasion to action over which Congress has no legislative control. Congress may not command that the science of agriculture be taught in state universities. But if it would aid the teaching of that science by grants to state institutions, it is appropriate, if not necessary, that the grant be on the condition, incorporated in the Morrill Act, 12 Stat. 503, 7 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq., 26 Stat. 417, 7 U.S.C.A.  321 et seq., that it be used for the intended purpose. Similarly it would seem to be compliance with the Constitution, not violation of it, for the government to take and the university to give a contract that the grant would be so used. It makes no dif- \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 84]\n\u00a0\n ference that there is a promise to do an act which the condition is calculated to induce. Co dition and promise are alike valid since both are in furtherance of the national purpose for which the money is appropriated.\n These effects upon individual action, which are but incidents of the authorized expenditure of government money, are pronounced to be themselves a limitation upon the granted power, and so the time-honored principle of constitutional interpretation that the granted power includes all those which are incident to it is reversed. 'Let the end be legitimate,' said the great Chief Justice, 'let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.' McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421. This cardinal guide to constitutional exposition must now be rephrased so far as the spending power of the federal government is concerned. Let the expenditure be to promote the general welfare, still if it is needful in order to insure its use for the intended purpose to influence any action which Congress cannot command because within the sphere of state government, the expenditure is unconstitutional. And taxes otherwise lawfully levied are likewise unconstitutional if they are appropriated to the expenditure whose incident is condemned.\n Congress through the Interstate Commerce Commission has set aside intrastate railroad rates. It has made and destroyed intrastate industries by raising or lowering tariffs. These results are said to be permissible because they are incidents of the commerce power and the power to levy duties on imports. See Minnesota Rate Case 1913, \n230 \nU.S. 352\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1151, Ann.Cas. 1916A, 18; Houston, E . & W.T.R. Co. v. U.S. (Shreveport Rate Case), \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833; Board of Trustees of University of Illinois v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 48\n, 53 S.Ct. 509. The only conclusion to be drawn is that re- \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 85]\n\u00a0\n sults become lawful when they are incidents of those powers but unlawful when incident to the similarly granted power to tax and spend.\n Such a limitation is contradictory and destructive of the power to appropriate for the public welfare, and is incapable of practical application. The spending power of Congress is in addition to the legislative power and not subordinate to it. This independent grant of the power of the purse, and its very nature, involving in its exercise the duty to insure expenditure within the granted power, presuppose freedom of selection among divers ends and aims, and the capacity to impose such conditions as will render the choice effective. It is a contradiction in terms to say that there is power to spend for the national welfare, while rejecting any power to impose conditions reasonably adapted to the attainment of the end which alone would justify the expenditure.\n The limitation now sanctioned must lead to absurd consequences. The government may give seeds to farmers, but may not condition the gift upon their being planted in places where they are most needed or even planted at all. The government may give money to the unemployed, but may not ask that those who get it shall give labor in return, or even use it to support their families. It may give money to sufferers from earthquake, fire, tornado, pestilence, or flood, but may not impose conditions, health precautions, designed to prevent the spread of disease, or induce the movement of population to safer or more sanitary areas. All that, because it is purchased regulation infringing state powers, must be left for the states, who are unable or unwilling to supply the necessary relief. The government may spend its money for vocational rehabilitation, 48 Stat. 389, but it may not, with the consent of all concerned, supervise the process which it undertakes to aid. It may spend its money for the suppression of the boll weevil, but may \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 86]\n\u00a0\n not compensate the farmers for suspending the growth of otton in the infected areas. It may aid state reforestation and forest fire prevention agencies, 43 Stat. 653 (see 16 U.S.C.A.  471, 499 note, 505, 515, 564 et seq.), but may not be permitted to supervise their conduct. It may support rural schools, 39 Stat. 929 (20 U.S.C.A.  11 et seq.), 45 Stat. 1151 (20 U.S.C.A.  15a to 15c), 48 Stat. 792 (20 U.S.C.A.  15d to 15g), but may not condition its grant by the requirement that certain standards be maintained. It may appropriate moneys to be expended by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation 'to aid in financing agriculture, commerce and industry,' and to facilitate 'the exportation of agricultural and other products.' Do all its activities collapse because, in order to effect the permissible purpose in myriad ways the money is paid out upon terms and conditions which influence action of the recipients within the states, which Congress cannot command? The answer would seem plain. If the expenditure is for a national public purpose, that purpose will not be thwarted because payment is on condition which will advance that purpose. The action which Congress induces by payments of money to promote the general welfare, but which it does not command or coerce, is but an incident to a specifically granted power, but a permissible means to a legitimate end. If appropriation in aid of a program of curtailment of agricultural production is constitutional, and it is not denied that it is, payment to farmers on condition that they reduce their crop acreage is constitutional. It is not any the less so because the farmer at his own option promises to fulfill the condition.\n That the governmental power of the purse is a great one is not now for the first time announced. Every student of the history of government and economics is aware of its magnitude and of its existence in every civilized government. Both were well understood by the framers of the Constitution when they sanctioned the grant of the spending power to the federal government, and both were recognized by Hamilton and Story, whose views of the \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 87]\n\u00a0\n spending power as standing on a parity with the other powers specifically granted, have hitherto been generally accepted.\n The suggestion that it must now be curtailed by judicial fiat because it may be abused by unwise use hardly rises to the dignity of argument. So may judicial power be abused. 'The power to tax is the power to destroy,' but we do not, for that reason, doubt its existence, or hold that its efficacy is to be restricted by its incidental or collateral effects upon the states. See Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533; McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27\n, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann.Cas. 561; compare Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40\n, 54 S.Ct. 599. The power to tax and spend is not without constitutional restraints. One restriction is that the purpose must be truly national. Another is that it may not be used to coerce action left to state control. Another is the conscience and patriotism of Congress and the Executive. 'It must be remembered that legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.' Justice Holmes, in Missouri, Kansas & Texas R. Co. v. May, \n194 \nU.S. 267, 270\n, 24 S. Ct. 638, 639.\n A tortured construction of the Constitution is not to be justified by recourse to extreme examples of reckless congressional spending which might occur if courts could not prevent-expenditures which, even if they could be thought to effect any national purpose, would be possible only by action of a legislature lost to all sense of public responsibility. Such suppositions are addressed to the mind accustomed to believe that it is the business of courts to sit in judgment on the wisdom of legislative action. Courts are not the only agency of government that must be assumed to have capacity to govern. Congress and the courts both unhappily may falter or be mistaken in the performance of their constitutional duty But interpretation of our great charter of government which proceeds on any assumption that the responsibility for the preservation of our institutions is the exclusive \n\n[297 U.S. 1, 88]\n\u00a0\n concern of any one of the three branches of government, or that it alone can save them from destruction is far more likely, in the long run, 'to obliterate the constituent members' of 'an indestructible union of indestructible states' than the frank recognition that language, even of a constitution, may mean what it says: that the power to tax and spend includes the power to relieve a nationwide economic maladjustment by conditional gifts of money.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] May 12, 1933, c. 25, 48 Stat. 31 (see 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq.). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 11 (48 Stat. 38) denominates wheat, cotton, field corn, hogs, rice, tobacco, and milk, and its products, 'basic agricultural commodities,' to which the act is to apply.

KNOTT(1936)\nNo. 643\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., \n\n[298 U.S. 544, 545]\n\u00a0\n Alger Hiss and Stanley F. Reed, Sol. Gen., both of Washington, D.C., James W. Morris, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Hadley W. Libbey and Paul A. Sweeney, both of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. C. L. Waller, of Tallahassee, Fla., for respondent, D. M. Lowry, receiver.\n Mr. H. E. Carter, of Tallahassee, la., for respondent, W. V. Knott, State Treasurer.\n Messrs. John Milton and Saul Nemser, both of Jersey City, N.J., and Herbert U. Feibelman, of Miami, Fla., for respondent, Carl K. Withers, as Commissioner of Banking and Insurance of the State of New Jersey.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The New Jersey Fidelity & Plate Glass Insurance Company is a surety company organized under the laws of that state. In 1932, it became insolvent; was upon its petition placed by a New Jersey court for liquidation in the hands of Kelly, the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance; and he sought to take possession of its assets wherever situated. In 1930, the company had deposited securities of the face value of $75,000 with the state treasurer of Florida in order to qualify there pursuant to sections 6302 and 6303 of Florida Compiled General Laws. It entered into many surety obligations in Florida \n\n[298 U.S. 544, 546]\n\u00a0\n prior to its insolvency; but no unsatisfied judgment against it was outstanding there when the New Jersey liquidation proceeding was begun.\n Kelly brought suit in Florida against State Treasurer Knott to restrain disposition of the deposited securities except upon order of that court. After the institution of his suit, an amendment to section 6303 made by chapter 16248 of the Florida Laws 1933, provided that in case the assets of a surety company should be placed in liquidation in the state of its incorporation, a Florida court 'shall have jurisdiction, upon bill filed by any party in interest, to take charge of the securities so deposited with the State Treasurer' and 'distribute the proceeds of the sale of said securities proportionally among all of the Florida creditors who may make proof of their claims,' 'the surplus, if any, to be disposed of by proper order of such court.' Thereupon, a Florida creditor brought suit under the amendment; that suit was consolidated with the one which Kelly had instituted; and a receiver was appointed who took possession of the securities and sold them.\n In the receivership proceeding the United States filed, and under Revised Statutes,  3466 (31 U.S.C.A.  191), claimed priority for, a debt of $14,075, that sum being the aggregate of twenty judgments which it recovered against the company in Florida on estreated appearance, or bail, bonds given there. The Florida officials insisted that the claim of the United States must be postponed to those of Florida creditors; the New Jersey commissioner, that priority can be accorded the United States, in any event, only in the domiciliary proceeding. The trial court denied it priority; and directed that debts due Florida, its political subdivisions, citizens or residents, be paid. The decree left undetermined whether the United States was entitled to receive in Florida payment from the residue after satisfaction of such Florida debts, or whether the residue \n\n[298 U.S. 544, 547]\n\u00a0\n should be transmitted to the domiciliary liquidator. The United States appealed on the ground that it has been denied priority; the New Jersey commissioner on the ground that the domiciliary liquidator was entitled to the residue remaining after satisfying the claims of creditors reduced to judgment prior to the institution of the proceedings in New Jersey. The order of the trial court was affirmed by the Supreme Court, with some modification. Kelly v. Knott, 120 Fla. 580, 163 So. 64. We granted certiorari, because of the importance of the question involved. \n297 \nU.S. 700\n, 56 S.Ct. 498.\n First. Revised statutes,  3466, provides that 'whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent' 'the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.' It is clear that, within the meaning of the section, the company had become insolvent, Bramwell v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n269 U.S. 483\n, 488-490, 46 S.Ct. 176, and that, ordinarily, debts due on judgments recovered by the United States are 'debts due to the United States.' Price v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 492, 499\n, 500 S., 46 S.Ct. 180. Compare Beaston v. Farmers' Bank, 12 Pet. 102, 134; Pierce v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 398, 401\n, 402 S., 41 S.Ct. 365. See, also, United States v. Mack, \n295 \nU.S. 480\n, 55 S.Ct. 813. The Florida officials contend that, since the priority accorded the United States depends entirely upon the statutory provision and is not an attribute of sovereignty, United States v. State Bank, 6 Pet. 29, Congress may deny to the Government the right of priority; and that, by prescribing elsewhere the conditions under which a surety company may write certain surety bonds in favor of the United States, United States Code, title 6,  1-11 (6 U.S.C.A.  1-11), it has indicated its intention to exclude the liabilities here involved from the operation of section 3466. We do not construe the legislation concerning surety bonds as having such effect. The cases relied upon dealt with legislation of a different character. Davis v. Pringle, \n268 \nU.S. 315\n, 45 S.Ct. 549; Mellon v. Michi- \n\n[298 U.S. 544, 548]\n\u00a0\n gan Trust Company, \n271 \nU.S. 236\n, 46 S.Ct. 511; United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n280 \nU.S. 478\n, 50 S.Ct. 212. We are of opinion that the claim presented is, in its nature, one entitled to priority.\n Second. The main question for decision is whether the Florida statute divested the company's title to the deposited securities or created a perfected lien thereon, so as to give the Florida creditors precedence over the United States.\n Section 6302 of the Florida Laws, which required the deposit, declares: 'And whenever such company ceases to do business in this State, and has settled up all claims against it, as hereinafter provided, and has been released from all the bonds upon which they have been taken as sureties said bonds (securities) shall be delivered up to the proper party on presentation of the Treasurer's receipt for said bonds.'\n Section 6303, as amended, provides: 'Whenever a final judgment has been rendered against any surety company on a fidelity, appearance, supersedeas or surety bond, the surety on said bond shall pay the same within thirty days. Upon notice of failure to pay the amount due under said bond within said time, the State Treasurer shall retain the bonds or securities deposited with him by said surety company ... to cover said judgment and costs, subject to the order of the Court trying any suit that may be brought upon said bond.' (Then follows the amendment of 1933 authorizing institution of the suit.)\n The trial court found that, by the deposit, the securities had been segregated and set apart out of the general assets of the company prior to the accrual of any liens of, or obligations to, the United States. We accept that finding as conclusive of the facts. The Supreme Court declared that the securities deposited by the company with the state treasurer constituted 'a trust fund \n\n[298 U.S. 544, 549]\n\u00a0\n to be held by him for the protection and benefit of all Florida claimants entitled to seek satisfaction thereout, regardless of the continued solvency of the depositing corporation, or its voluntary cessation of business in the state of Flroida'; and that, in enacting the legislation requiring such deposit, Florida did so with the intention of protecting those whom it had the power and duty to protect. It held that the deposit with the state treasurer constituted a trust fund for the benefit of Florida, its political subdivisions, citizens, and residents; that they were entitled to be paid first out of it; and that the United States was not a beneficiary of such trust fund. Insofar as the decision of the Supreme Court is a construction of the statute of the state, we accept it as conclusive.\n Third. The question for our decision is the legal effect upon the asserted federal right of the statute so construed. As was said in Thelusson v. Smith, 2 Wheat. 396, 426: 'The United States are to be first satisfied; but then it must be out of the debtor's estate. If, therefore, before the right of preference has accrued to the United States, the debtor has made a bona fide conveyance of his estate to a third person, or has mortgaged the same to secure a debt, or if his property has been seized under a fi. fa., the property is devested out of the debtor, and cannot be made liable to the United States.' See, also, Beaston v. Farmers' Bank of Delaware, 12 Pet. 102, 135, 136. The deposit of the securities rendered them subject to process within the state; and it may be assumed that the contemplated beneficiaries would have acquired thereby precedence over those claiming under a later voluntary assignment by the company or any later levy. But it is settled that an inchoate lien is not enough to defeat the priority. United States v. Oklahoma, \n261 \nU.S. 253\n, 43 S.Ct. 295; Spokane County v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 80\n, 49 S.Ct. 321; New York v. Maclay, \n288 \nU.S. 290\n, 53 S.Ct. 323. Unless the law \n\n[298 U.S. 544, 550]\n\u00a0\n of Florida effected, at least as early as the date of insolvency, either a transfer of title from the company, or a specific perfected lien in favor of the Florida creditors, the United States is entitled to priority.\n The Supreme Court of Florida holds, in the case at bar, that the amendment, which was not enacted until after the institution of the liquidation proceeding in New Jersey, did not change substantive rights. And in State v. Knott, 114 Fla. 95, 99, 153 So. 606, 608, also decided after enactment of the amendment, the court describes thus the effect of a deposit: 'The correct interpretation of the statute is that the securities in the hands of the State Treasurer, so held in trust by him for the account of the depositing company, are merely segregated assets of the surety company which, while capable of being specifically applied to the satisfaction of such final judgments against the surety company on fidelity and surety bonds as shall remain unpaid for thirty days, do not become impressed with the judgment lien until after the notice pursuant to which they may be expressly subjected thereto by the order of the court rendering a judgment on a bond executed by the depositing surety company.'\n Obviously, the deposit did not divest the company's title to the securities. No one was appointed trustee; and, at the time of the deposit, there was no ascertainable beneficiary. Who would share in the proceeds of the securities could not be known until they were exhausted in satisfaction of judgments, or until the entry of the decree of distribution in a suit authorized by the 1933 amendment. While in the case at bar the Supreme Court declared that the deposit created 'a trust fund,' the term appears to have been used to connote an inchoate general lien for the benefit of those persons who may become entitled to be paid from the proceeds, either as unsatisfied judgment creditors, or as Florida creditors at the time \n\n[298 U.S. 544, 551]\n\u00a0\n when insolvency supervenes. Such an interest lacks the characteristics of a specific perfected lien which alone bars the priority of the United States.\n Fourth. The Florida officials construe the opinion of its Supreme Court as holding that the United States is entitled to be paid in this proceeding from the surplus remaining after payment of the Florida creditors. They urge that from the report of the receiver it appears that such surplus will be adequate to satisfy the claim of the United States; they contend that, hence the United States is not adversely affected by the judgment under review; and they ask that the judgment be affirmed, or the certiorari be dismissed, on this ground. But no order has been entered in either of the Florida courts directing payment of the surplus to the United States; and, moreover, it is not clear that the surplus, if so applied, would satisfy its claim. As the debt due the United States remains unpaid, the judgment denying its priority prejudices its right.\n Fifth. Finally, the Florida of icials contend that this Court lacks jurisdiction, because the order of the trial court (that of May 28, 1934) which gave the local creditors priority over the United States, constituted the final order in the case and disposed of the right which the United States is here asserting; that this order was not appealed from; and that the later order of the trial court (that of October 27, 1934) from which an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Florida, was not a final order. We have no occasion to enquire into these matters which are of local concern. The judgment here under review is that of the Supreme Court. It denied to the United States the priority claimed under Section 3466 (31 U.S.C.A.  191). That denial is a final judgment under the rules governing our jurisdiction. In re Tiffany, \n252 \nU.S. 32, 36\n, 40 S.Ct. 239.\n Sixth. The New Jersey commissioner contends that the proceeds of the securities remaining after satisfying the \n\n[298 U.S. 544, 552]\n\u00a0\n claims of the local creditors must be transmitted to New Jersey; and that the Florida courts are without jurisdiction to award priority to the United States. It is true that the priority statute is not applicable unless insolvency has been manifested by some proceeding equivalent to an assignment of all of the debtor's property, United States v. Oklahoma, \n261 \nU.S. 253, 262\n, 43 S.Ct. 295; United States v. Hooe, 3 Cranch, 73, 91. The priority could not have been asserted in Florida or elsewhere, if there had been no such assignment. But this requirement of the statute was satisfied by the liquidation suit in New Jersey. United States v. Butterworth-Judson Corporation, \n269 \nU.S. 504\n, 46 S.Ct. 179. The United States properly intervened in Florida in order to prevent the assets there from being applied in payment of local claims believed to be subordinate to its own. No rule of law precludes it from asserting its priority by an appropriate proceeding in any jurisdiction in which property of the insolvent is being administered. The Florida court did not lack power to entertain its application; and the fact that the claim originated in Florida and was reduced to judgment there, made it appropriate that the United States should seek there satisfaction from funds deposited to assure payment of judgments entered on surety bonds given there by the company. No good reason has been suggested why the United States should be denied the right to secure in this proceeding payment of its debt.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Mandate of Supreme Court conformed to in Withers v.

RHODES(1936)\nNo. 546\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 383, 384]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., for the petitioners O'connor and others.\n Messrs. Stanley F. Reed, of Washington, D.C., and Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., for petitioners United States Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation and others.\n Mr. Hugh H. Obear, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Respondent, Thomas E. Rhodes, suing in his own right and on behalf of other creditors of the Commercial National Bank of Washington, sought the restoration of amounts alleged to have been illegally paid to petitioners by the bank's receiver. The payments were of amounts deposited with the bank by the United States Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation and the Alien Property Custodian, respectively. The bank had pledged assets to secure the deposits, and recognizing the pledges as valid, the receiver under the direction of the Comptroller of the Currency had paid the amount of the deposits in full. Similar relief was sought against the Comptroller of the Currency with respect to payments to the Comptroller, in like circumstances, of deposits made by him of moneys belonging to insolvent banks. Unse- \n\n[297 U.S. 383, 385]\n\u00a0\n cured creditors and depositors had received a dividend of but 50 per cent. of their claims. Respondent alleged that the above-mentioned pledges and the preferential payments were unlawful.\n The defendants, the Comptroller of the Currency and the receiver of the bank, moved to dismiss the bill of complaint for want of equity, and, in particular, because the bill failed to show any demand by plaintiff upon the Comptroller or receiver that such suits be brought or their refusal to sue. The defendants, the Fleet Corporation and the Attorney General, as successor to the Alien Property Custodian, made a similar motion. These motions were denied and a special appeal was allowed.\n The Court of Appeals held that, while as a rule a stockholders' or creditors' suit could not be maintained 'until demand has been made upon the receiver, the Comptroller, or the bank,' the rule did not apply 'where the receiver or Comptroller refuses to bring the suit ... or where it would be a vain thing to make demand upon them, and it is shown there is necessity for a suit for the protection of the interests of creditors.' The court was of the opinion that the facts alleged in the complaint w re sufficient to show that the Comptroller and the receiver 'were both actively and personally involved in the transactions claimed to be unlawful,' and that this was enough to take the case out of the ordinary rule. The court also held that the pledge made by the bank to secure the deposits by the Comptroller of the Currency of moneys belonging to insolvent banks was a valid pledge in view of the provisions of the Act of May 15, 1916, 39 Stat. 121 (12 U.S.C.A.  192), but that there was no authority for the exaction of pledges to secure the deposits which had been made by the Fleet Corporation and the Alien Property Custodian, and hence that those pledges were invalid. Accordingly, the order of the Supreme Court of the District was reversed and the dismissal of the bill was directed as to the Comptroller of \n\n[297 U.S. 383, 386]\n\u00a0\n the Currency, and with respect to the Fleet Corporation and the Acting Alien Property Custodian the order was affirmed. O'connor v. Rhodes, 65 App.D.C. 21, 79 F.(2d) 146.\n On motion for reargument, the Court of Appeals adhered to its decision. Id., 65 App.D.C. 27, 79 F.(2d) 152, 153. The court, however, took notice of the statement that the receiver, since the decision, had instituted a suit against the Acting Alien Property Custodian and the Fleet Corporation to recover the assets alleged to have been illegally pledged or the preferential payments made in consequence of such pledges- 'covering the same items, in the same circumstances, as are covered in the bill in the instant proceeding.' The court, while again recognizing the general rule, reiterated its view that the particular circumstances showed that the preferential payments in question 'were made at the instance and with the approval of the Comptroller and receiver' and that 'the claims for payment were instigated and invited by the Comptroller and the receiver.' The case was thus deemed to fall within the exception to the rule requiring demand and refusal before the bringing of suit. But the court noted the statement of counsel for the Comptroller that he no longer adhered to his former position that the payments to the Fleet Corporation and the Alien Property Custodian were validly made. As there had been no motion by either party to stay further proceedings in the instant suit, pending the prosecution by the receiver of the suit filed by him, the court did not press the point which it had raised as to its power to direct such a stay. That reservation was expressly stated to be 'without prejudice to the right of the trial court, on motion and in the exercise of its judicial discretion, and on such reasonable terms as it may impose, to arrange the order of trial in the two suits as may result in the most economical and speedy determination of the issues involved.'

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1936)\nNo. 169\nArgued: December 17, 1935Decided: January 6, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 481, 482]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Clay Judson, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner is trustee under a trust created by John P. Wilson, in 1913, for the benefit of his three children. Under a reserved power, the trust was four times amended. The sole question is whether the amendments created three separate trusts. The question arises in relation to the taxation of income. If there is but a single trust, as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled, an additional tax would be payable. If there are three trusts, as the Board of Tax Appeals determined, there would be no additional tax. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that there was only one trust. 75 F.(2d) 973. Certiorari was granted (\n296 \nU.S. 557\n, 56 S.Ct. 106) because of the conflicting decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Helvering, v. McIlvaine, 78 F.(2d) 787; Helvering v. McIlvaine, \n296 \nU.S. 488\n, 56 S.Ct. 332.\n By the original deed, one-third of the net income of the securities held in trust was to be paid to each of the three children while living, and upon the death of any one, to those who were to succeed to his or her interest in accord- \n\n[296 U.S. 481, 483]\n\u00a0\n ance with the provisions of the deed. During the first fifteen years of the trust the income could be accumulated by the trustee, with the written consent of the primary beneficiaries, and added to the principal. The trust was terminable at any time in whole or in part by the three children ( or survivors) subject to the approval of the grantor, if living, and in any event was to terminate on the death of all the children. Upon termination, one-third of the principal was to be distributed to each of the three children if living, and the share of a deceased child was to go according to the provisions of his or her will or, in the absence of such disposition, to the surviving issue of the decedent or, in default of such issue, to the surviving issue of the grantor per stirpes. Provision was made for the alteration of the trust 'in any respect and to any extent at any time' by the three children, or survivors, subject to the approval of the grantor if living. Thereafter the 'rights and powers of all parties concerned' were to be the same as though the trust deed had originally been executed in the altered form.\n In 1918, the three children, with the approval of the grantor, modified the trust so as to provide:\n'The trust estate now held under said trust deed shall be divided into three separate and equal parts or shares (to which may be assigned undivided interests in the whole or any part of the said trust estate), which parts or shares shall severally be designated by our respective names, and each of us and our respective legal representatives shall have the same rights, interest and power in and over one of said three equal parts or shares and the income thereof which is given to us respectively by said indenture ove one-third of said trust estate and the income thereof, except as may be otherwise specifically provided herein.'\n\n It was further provided that the whole of the net income received from each share during the remainder of 1918, \n\n[296 U.S. 481, 484]\n\u00a0\n and one-half of the net income received thereafter and during the life of the grantor, should be accumulated and added to the principal of such share, with privilege of withdrawal by the beneficiary, with the grantor's consent, of the amount so accumulated. All the provisions of the original trust deed, except as they were 'expressly or necessarily' modified by the new instrument, were to continue in force.\n In 1919, the three children, with the grantor's approval, executed another modifying instrument which provided that one-half of the net income 'of each of the three trust estates' should be paid over, as received, to the beneficiaries entitled thereto, and that the other one- half should be paid to them when the payment was requested by any two of the original beneficiaries; the net income not so paid over was to 'be added to the principal of the trust fund from which it is derived.' Provision was also made for the disposition of the net income in case of the death of any of the original beneficiaries and for the distribution of the 'several trust estates' upon termination.\n In 1920, the three children, with the approval of the grantor, modified the amendment of 1919 with respect to the disposition of income by providing that the trustee should pay out 'as much of the net income from each of said separate trusts' to the beneficiaries as should be requested by a majority in interest of the beneficiaries, with the added requirement that 'equal payments must be made out of the net income from each of said separate trusts, to the end that said several separate trusts may be maintained on a basis of equality in amount so far as practicable.' There was a further provision that so much of the net income, 'received in any year from each separate trust estate,' which was not paid out should form part 'of the principal of the separate trust estate' from which it was derived, and the trustee was required to \n\n[296 U.S. 481, 485]\n\u00a0\n devote to charitable purposes so much of the net income 'of said trusts' as should be requested by the three children (or survivors), such payments to be made 'in equal amounts from each of said separate trusts.'\n There was a further amendment in 1928 enlarging the powers conferred upon the trustee by the original deed with respect to the borrowing of money, the borrowed sums to be dealt with 'as part of the principal of the three trusts hereunder, in equal shares.'\n The purpose of the first amendment and the subsequent course of dealings are thus described in the findings of the Board of Tax Appeals, which are adequately supported by the evidence:\n'The purpose of the amendment of September 21, 1918, was to create three separate and distinct trusts, one for each of the beneficiaries of the single trust then in existence, in order to reduce liability for income taxes on the income of the trust.\n\n'Prior to the first amendment the trustee kept one cash account for the trust under the heading 'Trust under deed of John P. Wilson, for John P. Wilson, Jr., and others' to which was credited all income of the trust. On September 27, 1918, three accounts were opened up by the trustee, one in the name of 'Trust under Deed of John P. Wilson for John P. Wilson, Jr.' ; one under the name of 'Trust under Deed of John P. Wilson, for Anna W. Dickinson'; and the other under the name of 'Trust under Deed of John P. Wilson, for Martha Wilson'. The single account was then closed by transferring equal amounts of its balance to each of the new accounts. Thereafter cash received and disbursed on account of the trust property was entered in these accounts, one-third in each.\n\n'At the same time the property account kept by the trustee for the stock of the single trust was closed out by transferring the items thereof equally to accounts opened p under the names of the three beneficiaries. There was \n\n[296 U.S. 481, 486]\n\u00a0\n no actual division of the property held under the trust indenture. The new accounts as set up showed that one-third of each asset of the old trust represented the corpus of three new trusts, one for each of the three children of the grantor. Acquisitions of additional principal by purchase were divided equally among the three trusts.\n\n'The stock certificates acquired by the trustee before and after September 21, 1918, were carried in the name of the petitioner as trustee under the deed of trust of John P. Wilson or in the name of a nominee of the trustee. The cash belonging to the trusts in question here and all other trusts being administered by the trustee was kept in one general account with another bank.\n\n'During the taxable years the trustee rendered separate reports each month to the beneficiaries on the basis of a separate trust for each. For each of the years 1924 to 1929, inclusive, it filed fiduciary and income tax returns on the basis of a separate and distinct trust for each child. In his audit of the returns the respondent determined that the income held in trust under the indenture of March 12, 1913, as amended, was taxable on the basis of a single trust and a single return for each year.'\n\n The Board of Tax Appeals concluded that 'three separate and distinct trusts' were created.\n No question is raised as to the validity of the several amendments. The only question is as to their construction and effect. The parties, if they pleased, had power to convert the single trust into three trusts and the evidence and findings leave no doubt as to their intention to do so. The question is whether they accomplished their purpose. United States v. Phellis, \n257 \nU.S. 156, 172\n, 42 S.Ct. 63. If the various securities had been divided physically, if new certificates of stock had been obtained for the several beneficiaries, and such certificates and specific bonds and cash had been set aside for each, there would be no room for argument that three separate trusts were not created. But it was \n\n[296 U.S. 481, 487]\n\u00a0\n not necessary to have such a physical division in order to carry out the clear intention of the parties. An undivided interest in property may constitute the corpus of a trust. The original trust deed provided that its provisions and limitations should be construed according to the laws of Illinois. But the elementary principle is applied in Illinois, as elsewhere, that 'every kind of vested right which the law recognizes as valuable may be transferred in trust.' Burke v. Burke, 259 Ill. 262, 268, 102 N.E. 293, 295. 'It (a trust) may be created in any property, real or personal, legal or equitable, which is in existence, and which in the eye of a court of equity is of value.' Gurnett v. Mutual Life Insurance Co., 356 Ill. 612, 617, 191 N.E. 250, 252. Perry on Trusts (7th Ed.)  67, 68. Nor are the amending instruments open to the objection that the subject of the trusts was not adequately defined. Compare Snyder v. Snyder, 280 Ill. 467, 469, 470, 117 N.E. 465; Marble v. Marble's Estate, 304 Ill. 229, 236, 136 N.E. 589. Where there is an intention to create separate trusts, the fact that 'the trusts' are 'kept in one fund' does not necessarily defeat the intention and require the conclusion that there is but a single trust. In re Colegrove's Estate, 221 N.Y. 455, 459, 117 N.E. 813. 'In many cases,' said the Court of Appeals of New York in Vanderpoel v. Loew, 112 N.Y. 167, 180, 19 N.E. 481, 484, where 'income and principal were given in equal shares, although out of one fund kept in solido for convenience of investment, a severance of the trust into its component parts has been adjudged. ... The shares and interests are several, although the fund remains undivided.' See, also, Rollestone v. National Bank of Commerce, 299 Mo. 57, 71, 252 S.W. 394.\n In the instant case, immediately following the first amendment, the trustee opened separate accounts for the three trusts and the single acc unt previously kept was closed. Income received and amounts disbursed were di- \n\n[296 U.S. 481, 488]\n\u00a0\n vided and entered in the separate accounts. The property account of the single trust was closed and the items were transferred equally to separate accounts in the names of the beneficiaries, showing one-third of the assets of the old trust as representing the corpus of each of the three trusts. New principal was divided equally in the same way. If, at the outset, there had been three trust deeds, each creating a trust for the benefit of a distinct beneficiary in an undivided one-third of the property involved, no question would have arisen. We think the same result was achieved by the use of the power of amendment. We find no ground for concluding that the purpose of the parties to create the three trusts was not carried out.\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the order of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. ATLANTIC MUT. INS. CO.(1936)\nNo. 21\nArgued: October 18, 1935Decided: May 25, 1936\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and \nJ. Frank Staley, of Washington, D.C., for the United States. \n\n[298 U.S. 483, 484]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. M. Lyeth, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 483, 486]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit to obtain a contribution in general average by reason of the sacrifice of part of a ship's cargo for the benefit of the ship and cargo as a whole. The Court of Claims gave judgment for the claimant, and the case is here on certiorari. The material facts, as shown by the findings below, are as follows:\n In 1918 the Logan, an army transport owned and operated by the United States, left San Francisco for Manila with a cargo consisting of military supplies belong ng to the United States, certain property belonging to the government of the Philippine Islands and its railroad, and other property belonging in large part to the American Red Cross and in lesser part to officers of the United States Army, none of which was being transported for \n\n[298 U.S. 483, 487]\n\u00a0\n hire. During the voyage fire broke out in the hold from a cause free from negligence, and to prevent a loss of both vessel and cargo the master caused part of the cargo to be jettisoned and water to be let into the hold, whereby other parts of the cargo were damaged. After the fire was extinguished the transport continued the voyage and arrived at the port of destination January 19, 1919. All that remained of the cargo was then discharged and, with the master's assent, was delivered to its owners without obtaining from them any bond to secure payment of general average.\n The part of the cargo belonging to the Philippine government and its railroad was insured against marine perils, including fire, by policies obtained before the voyage was begun. Substantial portions of this property were jettisoned or damaged at the time of the fire. April 12, 1921, the underwriter, in compliance with the policies, paid to the Philippine government and its railroad the amounts of their respective losses, and thereby became subrogated to their rights, if any, under the maritime rule respecting general average.\n May 15, 1921, the underwriter presented to the War Department a claim for general average contribution based on the facts here stated, and the claim was denied. But the Judge Advocate General disapproved that ruling and gave an opinion that the claim was well grounded. Thereafter, on August 22, 1922, an administrative officer in the army transport service transmitted the files relating to the claim to a company doing business as an average adjuster and insurance broker at San Francisco and requested that the adjuster prepare 'a statement of general average in order that the responsibility of the various parties concerned may be determined.' The adjuster accepted that task and completed and rendered such a statement December 31, 1926. In this statement the adjuster computed the net contribu- \n\n[298 U.S. 483, 488]\n\u00a0\n tion to be made by the United States to the underwriter by reason of the latter's subrogation to the rights of the Philippine government and its railroad at something over $40,000; and also computed the contributions to be made to the underwriter by other cargo owners. On March 28, 1928, the accounting officers of the United States denied the claim for contribution, and on December 10, 1928, the Comptroller General, on review, sustained that ruling. The claimant brought the present suit in the Court of Claims February 18, 1929\n\n\n One of the defenses interposed by the government and rejected by the court is that the claim had become completely barred before the suit was begun. The statute1 invoked by this defense declares:\n'Every claim against the United States cognizable by the Court of Claims, shall be forever barred unless the petition setting forth a statement thereof is filed in the court ... within six years after the claim first accrues.'\n\n The government contends that the claim first accrued on January 19, 1919, when the transport reached its destination and delivered what remained of the cargo to the cargo owners. On the other hand, the claimant insists the claim first accrued on December 31, 1926, when the adjuster completed and rendered the general average statement. The court rejected the government's contention and sustained that of the claimant. In this we think it erred.\n The court recognized that the transport, had it been privately owned, would have become subject to a suit in rem for contribution in general average upon its arrival at destination and the delivery of the cargo, but held that as the transport was government owned and in the public service such a suit would not lie against it. We assent to this, but thi k the accrual of the right to contri- \n\n[298 U.S. 483, 489]\n\u00a0\n bution did not depend upon whether it could be enforced by a suit in rem against the ship. Such a right accrues if and when all the elements essential to its existence are present, regardless of whether the appropriate means of enforcement be a suit in rem or a suit in personam. In this instance, as we shall show, a suit of the latter class was the appropriate means.\n The law of general average is an ancient feature of the maritime law and proceeds on the equitable principle that that which is sacrificed by one for the benefit of all in the course of a common venture at sea should be made good by the contribution of all. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Various means of enforcing such contribution have become well recognized, such as a suit in rem in admiralty against ship or cargo, a suit in personam in admiralty against ship owner or cargo owner,3 and an action at law4 or a suit in equity5 against ship owner or cargo owner. Save for exceptional rulings afterwards disapproved, the courts in dealing with such suits and actions have regarded the right to contribution as accruing and becoming enforceable upon the arrival of the ship at the port of destination and the delivery of the cargo. In reason the rule could not well be otherwise, for every element of the right is then present. That the amount of the required \n\n[298 U.S. 483, 490]\n\u00a0\n contribution may then be unliquidated is no obstacle, for in proper sequence liquidation comes after accrual, and can be made in the suit or action wherein the right is presented for adjudication. In this regard a claim for contribution does not differ from many others where at the time of accrual the recoverable damages or amount due remains unliquidated. As was well said in a related case,6 'The law is familiar enough in actions of tort and in many actions in contract, with liabilities which are presently due, although unliquidated.'\n The United States is not suable without its assent, and therefore a suit in personam against it as the owner of the vessel needed the support of a permissive statute. But there is such a statute,7 which has been long in force. It in direct terms invests the Court of Claims with jurisdiction to hear and determine all claims against the United States founded 'upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect of which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty if the United States were suable.'\n It is under this statute that claims against the United States for general average contribution are brought and adjudicated in the Court of Claims. Obviously the statute contemplates that a claim may accrue and be sued on even though the damages sought be unliquidated.\n For these reasons we think it quite plain that the present claim accrued January 19, 19 9, when the ship reached its destination and the cargo was delivered. \n\n[298 U.S. 483, 491]\n\u00a0\n The court below attached much importance to the statement in general average made by the adjuster at the request of an administrative officer in the army transport service. Indeed, the court treated the statement as being 'in the nature of an account stated,' and ruled that the right to contribution accrued when it was rendered. In this we think the court misconceived the functions of the adjuster and the nature of the statement. The adjuster was not an arbitrator,8 nor was the statement anything more than a provisional estimate and calculation which his principal, the owner, was free to adopt or to put aside. In the absence of some stipulation on the subject, and there was none, his function was only that of aiding or assisting the owner in gathering and stating data and making appropriate calculations as a suggested basis for an adjustment to be made by the owner, or under the owner's direction. It is not shown that the owner adopted the statement or put it forth as an authorized statement. In this situation the statement had no binding force as a stated account or otherwise. As was explained by Lord Herschell when speaking for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Wavertree Sailing Ship Co. v. Love, l.R., (1897) A.C. 373: 'The right to receive and the obligation to make general average contribution existed long before any class of persons devoted themselves as their calling to the preparation of average statements. It was formerly, according to Lord Tenterden, the practice to employ an insurance broker for the purpose. The shipowner was not bound to employ a member of any particular class of persons or indeed to employ any one at all. He might if he pleased make out his own average statement, and he may do the same at the present time if so minded. If he en- \n\n[298 U.S. 483, 492]\n\u00a0\n gages the services of an average stater, it is merely as a matter of business convenience on his part.'\n What we have said suffices to show that the claim accrued more than six years before the suit was begun, and therefore was barred by the statute.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S.C., title 28,  262 (28 U.S.C.A.  262). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Barnard v.

The companies had made deposits with the superintendent of insurance of the state of New York in order to obtain authority to transact business within the state. The complaints alleged that in 1917, or 1918, the companies had been dissolved, and their properties had been 'confiscated and appropriated,' by decrees of the Russian State. The claim of the United States is based upon an assignment made by the Russian government, on November 16, 1933, in connection with the recognition of that government. Defendants hold the funds in question under orders and judgments of the state court in New York, providing for liquidation and distribution.\n In each case, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency, and, in opposition to complainant's motion for an interlocutory injunction restraining distribution, set up the proceedings of the state court. The District Court denied t e motions for injunction and dismissed the complaints upon the grounds (1) that the Russian decrees, by reason of their confiscatory character, were ineffective to vest in the Russian government the title to these funds situated in New York, and (2) that these funds were not covered by the assignment to the United States. 10 F.Supp. 269.

Van Schaick, 77 F.(2d) 880; United States v. President, etc., of Manhattan Co., 77 F.(2d) 881. Because of the nature and importance of the questions presented, we granted writs of certiorari, October 14, 1935. \n296 \nU.S. 558\n, 56 S.Ct. 111.\n The special facts of the three cases are these:\n\n\n (1)\n The case against the Bank of New York & Trust Company (No. 195) relates to the deposit made by the Moscow Fire Insurance Company. By order of the Supreme Court of the state of New York, in 1925, the superintendent of insurance was appointed liquidator of the United States branch of the company pursuant to section 63 of the state Insurance Law (Consol. Laws, c. 28) and creditors were enjoined from pursuing their legal remedies against the assets so sequestered. The superintendent of insurance took possession of the assets and proceeded in the course of liquidation to satisfy the claims of domestic creditors and policyholders. There remained a substantial surplus.\n Similar results followed the superintendent's liquidation of the branches of other Russian companies, and the disposition of the surplus assets was brought before the Court of Appeals of New York. Creditors and policyholders with claims arising out of foreign business insisted that the time had come when their claims should be enforceable. The insurance companies insisted that they were still 'jurisdic persons,' that they were represented by boards of directors competent to act, and were entitled to possession subject to the remedies of creditors. The court declined to sustain the position of the superintendent that the surplus should be left in his hands indefinitely-until the recognition of a Russian government. As the superintendent had fulfilled the statutory trust, the court considered it to be no part of his duty to ascertain the validity of the claims that would be paid out of the surplus 'unless inequity would be done if the claimants were remitted to a remedy at law.' Exceptions were recognized where attachments or executions had been levied before the date of liquidation and also where \n\n[296 U.S. 463, 472]\n\u00a0\n proofs of claim had been filed and diligently pressed while the superintendent was still in charge and the injunction was still in force. As the creditors so proving were acting in response to an invitation- published in accordance with the order of liquidation-to submit claims of every kind without reference to the place of origin, and were meanwhile stayed, the court thought that there would be manifest inequity if at that late day they were remitted to their legal remedies and compelled to prove anew. A court of equity having assumed control over a fund might continue to grant relief if justice so required. But the court took the view that after the liquidator had made provision for the payment of claims already filed, the surplus then remaining 'should be paid to the corporations, represented by directors, a quorum of the board.' People, by Beha, v. Russian Reinsurance Co., 255 N.Y. 415, 420-424, 175 N.E. 114, 117.\n The Moscow Fire Insurance Company, however, had been left with but one director; and although he might be treated as a 'conservator' of the property of his company when there were assets within the state 'that might otherwise be lost,' the Court of Appeals was of the opinion that a measure of discretion should be exercised by a court of equity 'before surrendering possession.' Exercising that discretion, the court directed that the delivery of the assets in the case of that company should be conditioned upon the execution of a bond to the people of the state in a sum equal to the value of the assets delivered, with a condition that the director should faithfully apply the assets to the use of the corporation, its creditors and shareholders. In the event of inability or failure to give the bond, the court directed that delivery should be made to a trust company 'as agent or depositary' upon the stipulation of the insurance company and its 'conservator' that the fund would 'not be withdrawn except upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.' In re \n\n[296 U.S. 463, 473]\n\u00a0\n People (Moscow Fire Insurance Co.), 255 N.Y. 433, 435, 175 N.E. 120, 121. On the remittitur of the Court of Appeals, judgment was entered in the Supreme Court of the state on August 11, 1931, and provided, in the stated alternative, that the superintendent should deliver the surplus assets to the Bank of New York & Trust Company. The Moscow Company and Paul Lucke, 'its sole surviving director and conservator,' took advantage of this alternative and gave the required stipulation, whereupon the Trust Company received the surplus assets, of about $1,000,000, on April 18, 1933.\n Immediately-on April 19, 1933-the Moscow Company and Lucke brought suit in the Supreme Court of the state to determine the disposition of these assets, including the determination of the claims of creditors. A second suit was brought in June, 1933, by a shareholder of the Moscow Company. In October, 1933, the first of these suits was referred to a referee to hear and determine, and later the two suits were consolidated. Trial was had before the referee and proofs of claims of various creditors and shareholders of the Moscow Company were submitted. On August 13, 1934, when the referee was about to file his report, the United States' attorney presented to the referee a proof of claim of the United States to the entire fund, based upon the assignment of November 16, 1933, by the Russian government. Apparently the claim was not pressed and an understanding was reached that the referee would withhold his report until August 21, 1934, and that the United States would meanwhile determine in what manner it would assert its claim, whether by intervention in a proceeding in the state court or by suit in the federal court. The referee made no mention of the claim in his report, which was filed on August 22, 1934. Judgment was at once entered upon the report directing payment of the claims of creditors as allowed by the referee and, after making reservation for future claims \n\n[296 U.S. 463, 474]\n\u00a0\n and expenses, ordering the distribution of the residue in liquidating dividends to the shareholders of the Moscow Company. There was also provision that any shareholder, or any party to the action, or successor in interest, might apply at the foot of the judgment for further directions. On the same day the United States brought the present suit.\n\n\n (2)\n The case against the president and directors of the Manhattan Company (No. 196) relates to the Northern Insurance Company of Moscow. Under an order of the state court, in 1926, the superintendent of insurance took possession of the assets of the United States branch of the company. The statutory liquidation was completed. But as the company was left with but two directors, provision was made in April, 1931-under the decision of the Court of Appeals of New York-for the delivery of the surplus assets to a trust company, in case the required bond was not given. In re People (Northern Insurance Co.), 255 N.Y. 433, 435, 175 N.E. 120. In the following year an assignment for the benefit of creditors was made on behalf of the Northern Insurance Company to the Bank of Manhattan Trust Company, the predecessor in interest of the defendant in the present suit. Pursuant to a decision of the Court of Appeals on reargument (Matter of People (Northern Insurance Co.), 262 N.Y. 453, 188 N.E. 17), judgment was entered, on June 6, 1933, in the Supreme Court of the state directing the superintendent of insurance to deliver the surplus assets to the Bank of Manhattan Trust Company 'as agent or depositary' to be held subject to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. The delivery was made, the amount being upwards of $245,000. On November 13, 1933, the state court directed the president and directors of the Manhattan Company, as successor in interest, to transfer the fund to itself 'as assignee for the benefit of creditors of the Northern Insur- \n\n[296 U.S. 463, 475]\n\u00a0\n ance Company of Moscow.' In July, 1934, the state court appointed a referee to take and state the account of the assignee, and to take proof and report as to the claims of creditors and those entitled to share in the disposition of the fund. That proceeding was in progress when the present suit by the United States was begun on August 25, 1934.\n\n\n (3)\n The third case (No. 197) relates to the assets of the United States branch of the First Russian Insurance Company, which the state court, in 1925, placed in the hands of the superintendent of insurance as liquidator. This case differs from the others in that the superintendent is still in possession. After the payment of domestic creditors, the surplus assets were retained by the superintendent under the order of the state court for the purpose of satisfying valid claims founded upon foreign business, where proofs of claim had been filed with him during the statutory liquidation. People, by Beha, v. First Russian Insurance Co., 255 N.Y. 415, 423, 175 N.E. 114. It appears that some of these foreign claims had been allowed by the liquidator and payments on account had been made under orders of the state court, and that other claims which the liquidator had disallowed were being heard before a referee appointed by the state court, when the United States brought the present suit on November 14, 1934. The government states that the fund then held by the superintendent amounted to over $1,000,000.\n First. When the state court directed the superintendent of insurance to take possession of the assets of the United States branches, and to conserve those assets until its further order, the court took jurisdiction of the res. While the superintendent was a statutory liquidator, he took possession under the direction of the court and the fund was at all times subject to the court's control. The proceeding was essentially one in rem and the superintendent was protected by a sweeping injunction in the \n\n[296 U.S. 463, 476]\n\u00a0\n unimpeded liquidation of the sequestered property. People, by Beha, v. Russian Reinsurance Co., supra, 255 N.Y. 415, page 420, 175 N.E. 114. Under section 63 of the state statute (Insurance Law, Consol.Laws, c. 28), the liquidator had rights and duties such as had previously been 'exercised by and imposed upon ancillary receivers of foreign corporations.' Id., 255 N.Y. 415, page 424, 175 N.E. 114, 117.\n When the statutory trust was satisfied by the payment of domestic creditors and policyholders, it did not follow that the remaining assets were automatically released and the state court was ipso facto shorn of its jurisdiction. The court still had control of the property and necessarily had the pertinent equitable jurisdiction to decide what should be done with it. In such a case, the court might direct that the surplus assets should be remitted to a domiciliary receiver-if there were one-on appropriate conditions. In re People by Stoddard (Norske Lloyd Insurance Co.), 242 N.Y. 148, 151 N.E. 159. Or the court might direct further liquidation, in order to provide for the payment of other claims, if that course appealed to the sense of equity in the particular circumstances. People, by Beha, v. Russian Reinsurance Co., supra, 255 N.Y. 415, page 423, 175 N.E. 114. The latter action was taken and the superintendent of insurance was continued in possession of the assets subject to the control of the court. He was virtually its receiver for the purposes specified. In No. 197, the superintendent still holds possession by virtue of that authorization, and the res thus remain under the court's jurisdiction.\n In the other two cases (Nos. 195 and 196) the superintendent completed the additional liquidation and turned over the remaining assets to the designated depositaries. To safeguard all rights in the funds, they were not to be withdrawn from the depositaries except upon a court order. We need not pause to inquire as to the effect of that limitation, for, if jurisdiction was relinquished, it was soon resumed. On the very next day, in the case of the \n\n[296 U.S. 463, 477]\n\u00a0\n Moscow Fire Insurance Company, suit was brought in its name, and by the sole surviving director and conservator, against the depositary and those alleged to be creditors and shareholders of the insurance company, to determine the disposition of the fund. Claims of creditors and shareholders were in course of adjudication in that proceeding when the present suit was brought. At that time, also, in the case of the Northern Insurance Company, the depositary-which had received an assignment for the benefit of creditors-was accounting in the state court for the fund in its hands and the claims of creditors and of those entitled to share in the fund were being heard.\n In both these cases the proceedings in the state court were quasi in rem. Control of the funds was essential to the exercise of the court's jurisdiction to protect the rights of claimants. It was not necessary for the court to appoint receivers, as the funds were already in the hands of depositaries appointed by the court and subject to its direction. The principle, applicable to both federal and state courts, that the court first assuming jurisdiction over property may maintain and exercise that jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other, is not restricted to cases where property has been actually seized under judicial process before a second suit is instituted. It applies as well where suits are brought to marshal assets, administer trusts, or liquidate estates, and in suits of a similar nature, where, to give effect to its jurisdiction, the court must control the property. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street Elevated R. Co., \n177 \nU.S. 51, 61\n, 20 S.Ct. 564. If the two suits are in rem or quasi in rem, so that the court must have possession or control of the res in order to proceed with the cause and to grant the relief sought, the jurisdiction of one court must of necessity yield to that of the other. Penn General Casualty Company v. Pennsylvania, \n294 \nU.S. 189, 195\n, 55 S.Ct. 386. This principle is applied in the discharge of the long- recognized duty of this court to give effect to such \n\n[296 U.S. 463, 478]\n\u00a0\n 'methods of procedure as shall serve to conciliate the distinct and independent tribunals of the States and of the Union, so that they may co- operate as harmonious members of a judicial system coextensive with the United States.' Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 583, 595. See, also, Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 625; Buck v. Colbath, 3 Wall. 334, 341; Wabash Railroad Co. v. Adelbert College, \n208 \nU.S. 38, 54\n, 28 S.Ct. 182; Palmer v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 118, 129\n, 29 S.Ct. 230; Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 89\n, 43 S.Ct. 480; Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 \nU.S. 36, 43\n, 48 S.Ct. 268.\n The government urges that the present suits for an accounting are not suits in rem, but in personam; and that to allow the federal court to pass upon the right asserted would not necessarily interfere with the jurisdiction or control by the state court over the res. See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 230\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 24 A. L.R. 1077. But these suits are not to enforce a personal liability, but to obtain possession of the respective funds. The suits are not merely to establish a debt or a right to share in property, and thus to obtain an adjudication which might be had without disturbing the control of the state court. Compare Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank & Trust Co., \n215 U.S. 33\n, 44-46, 30 S.Ct. 10 Riehle v. Margolies, \n279 \nU.S. 218, 223\n, 224 S., 49 S.Ct. 310. Complainant demands that the depositaries account and pay over to the complainant, as 'the sole and exclusive owner,' the entire funds in their hands. Thus the object of the suits is to take the property from the depositaries and from the control of the state court, and to vest the property in the United States to the exclusion of all those whose claims are being adjudicated in the state proceedings.\n The government also insists that the courts of the state had lost jurisdiction of the funds, prior to the time when the present suits were begun, by reason of the fact that the funds were the property of the Russian government which our government had recognized. But, what- \n\n[296 U.S. 463, 479]\n\u00a0\n ever the effect of recognition, it is manifest that it did not terminate the state proceedings. The state court still had control of the property and questions as to the rights of the parties who were before it, or of those who might come before it, were legal questions which the court had jurisdiction to decide.\n Second. The fact that the complainant in these suits is the United States does not justify a departure from the rule which would otherwise be applicable. The government invokes section 24(1) of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  41, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1) which confers jurisdiction upon the District Court to entertain all suits of a civil nature brought by the United States. The government insists that the United States is entitled to have its claim determined in its own courts. But the grant of jurisdiction to the District Court in suits brought by the United States does not purport to confer exclusive jurisdiction. It is a general rule that the grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive. See Gittings v. Crawford, Taney, 1, Fed.Cas. No. 5,465; Ames v. Kansas, \n111 \nU.S. 449, 464\n, 4 S.Ct. 437; Plaquemines Tropical Fruit Co. v. Henderson, \n170 \nU.S. 511, 517\n, 518 S., 18 S.Ct. 685; Merryweather v. United States (C.C.A.) 12 F.(2d) 407, 409, 410. Upon the state courts, equally with the courts of the Union, rests the obligation to guard and enforce every right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States whenever those rights are involved in any suit or proceedings before them. Robb v. Connolly, \n111 \nU.S. 624, 637\n, 4 S.Ct. 544. In this instance, it cannot be doubted that the United States is free to invoke the jurisdiction of the state court for the determination of its claim, and the decision of the state court of any federal question which may be presented upon such an invocation, may be reviewed by this court, and thus all the questions which the government seeks to raise in these suits may be appropriately and finally decided. Jud.Code,  237, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 U.S. C.A.  344). \n\n[296 U.S. 463, 480]\n\u00a0\n The statutory grant of jurisdiction to the District Court leaves open the question of the propriety of its exercise in particular circumstances. Even where the District Court has acquired jurisdiction prior to state proceedings, the character and adequacy of the latter proceedings in relation to the administration of assets within the state, and the status of those assets, may require in the proper exercise of the discretion of the federal court that jurisdiction should be relinquished in favor of the state administration. Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176, 185\n, 55 S.Ct. 380, 96 A.L.R. 1166; Gordon v. Ominsky, \n294 \nU.S. 186, 188\n, 55 S.Ct. 391; Penn General Casualty Company v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n294 U.S. 189\n, page 197, 55 S.Ct. 386. In the instant cases not only had the state court first acquired jurisdiction, but there are numerous persons whose claims in relation to these funds are in course of adjudication. Whether or not their claims are valid against the claim of ownership by the United States they are entitled to be heard and they are indispensable parti  to any proceeding for the disposition of the property involved. They have not been made parties to the present suits, and this fact in itself would be a sufficient reason for the District Court to refuse to proceed in their absence. Only the stakeholders are defendants. The adverse claimants are parties to the respective proceedings in the state court and from every point of view the principles governing the convenient and orderly administration of justice require that the jurisdiction of the state court should be respected.\n There is no merit in the suggestion that the United States, in presenting its claim in the state proceedings, would be compelled to take the position of a defendant-being sued without its consent. In intervening for the presentation of its claim, the United States would be an actor- voluntarily asserting what it deemed to be its rights-and not a defendant. We cannot see that there would be impairment of any rights the United States may \n\n[296 U.S. 463, 481]\n\u00a0\n possess, or any sacrifice of its proper dignity as a sovereign, if it prosecuted its claim in the appropriate forum where the funds are held.\n As we are dealing simply with the question of the exercise of jurisdiction by the District Court, we intimate no opinion upon the merits.\n The decrees are affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. CORRICK(1936)\nNo. 656\nArgued: April 6, 1936Decided: May 18, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois. \n\n[298 U.S. 435, 436]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and John Dickinson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellants.\n Mr. George I. Haight, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of a specially constituted district court awarding an interlocutory injunction against the Secretary of Agriculture and others restraining them from prosecuting the appellees, operators of market agencies at the Chicago stockyards, for violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921.1\n The appellees are, for the most part, the same persons and corporations as the appellants in No. 655, Acker v. U.S., \n298 \nU.S. 426\n, 56 S.Ct. 824, 80 L.Ed. --. While that case was pending on appeal to this court, and the rates therein prescribed by order of the Secretary of Agriculture were suspended until final determination respecting their validity, the appellees prepared and posted, on October 19, 1935, a schedule of rates for market services at the Chicago \n\n[298 U.S. 435, 437]\n\u00a0\n stockyards to become effective November 1, 1935. These rates were, in most instances, higher than those prescribed by the secretary's orders of January 8 and March 12, 1934. On the same day the appellees tendered the schedule to the secretary for filing. He declined to receive it, assigning as reasons for his refusal that once rates are fixed by him, no change therein may be made except by his order or by action of a court of competent jurisdiction, and that litigation was then pending challenging the validity of his outstanding orders. Thereupon the appellees filed their bill in the District Court reciting the course of the secretary's proceedings referred to in No. 655, the orders made, and the suit to restrain their enforcement. The pleading asserts that the orders were based on data for the years 1931 and 1932; that, subsequent to promulgation of the orders, conditions had so changed that to prevent destruction of their business the appellees were compelled to adopt a new schedule of charges; it recites the secretary's refusal to file the new schedule and alleges that the refusal was a violation of his duty under the act; it charges that his refusal was of no effect, since his only power in the premises was to file the schedule, and, if he believed the rates named therein unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory, to suspend them, pursuant to the provisions of the act, and, after hearing, fix reasonable and non-discriminatory rates. The bill alleges that the schedule of October 19, 1935, became effective November 1, 1935, and that if appellees failed to conform thereto they would incur heavy penalties, while, on the other hand, the secretary was threatening to prosecute them unless they adhered to the rates prescribed by his orders of January 8 and March 12, 1934. After a hearing upon the bill and a supporting affidavit, the court granted an injunction.\n On appeal from the granting or refusal of an interlocutory injunction, our inquiry is limited to the ques- \n\n[298 U.S. 435, 438]\n\u00a0\n tion whether the court abused its discretion. 2 The appellants urge that the action taken constituted such an abuse for the reason that want of jurisdiction is evident upon the face of the bill. With this contention we agree.\n Section 316 of the Packers and Stockyards Act3 adopts the same procedure for restraining enforcement of or setting aside orders of the secretary as is provided by law with respect to orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. By section 1 of the Commerce Court Act4 jurisdiction was conferred upon the Commerce Court 'over all cases ... brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.' The Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913,5 transferred the jurisdiction of the Commerce Court to the district courts and provided that such cases should be heard by three judges. The words of the statute exclude a mere refusal to act from the section conferring jurisdiction, and this court has accordingly held that an order negative in form and substance is not within the relief accorded. \n6\n It is clear that \n\n[298 U.S. 435, 439]\n\u00a0\n the instant bill was not one to set aside or suspend any order of the secretary. The proceeding brought for that purpose was No. 655, just decided. This suit is to restrain the secretary and others from instituting prosecution for violations of an order. Its ultimate purpose is to secure a decree affirming the validity and effectiveness of the rate schedule posted by the appellees October 19, 1934. The injunction restrains the defendants from preventing, or attempting to prevent, or from interfering with the appellees in the collection of the ates of charge fixed by the schedule tendered to the secretary October 19, 1935\n\n\n The District Court was without jurisdiction for a further reason. Section 306 of the Packers and Stockyards Act7 directs that within sixty days after the secretary shall have given notice that a stockyard falls within the definition of section 302 (7 U.S.C.A.  202) every market agency at such stockyard shall file with him, and keep open for inspection, schedules of rates and charges for its services. No changes are to be made in the rates so filed and published except after ten days' notice to the secretary and to the public. Section 310 authorizes an order for investigation and a hearing by the secretary on complaint, or on his own initiative, as to whether existing rates are unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory, and empowers him, after such hearing, to 'determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable rate or charge, or rates or charges, to be thereafter observed in such case, or the maximum of minimum, or maximum and minimum, to be charged, and what regulation or practice is or will be just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory to be thereafter followed. ...'8 Section 306 prescribes the method of initiating rates upon the act's becoming effective, and of voluntary alteration of them from time to time. But when the secretary, pur- \n\n[298 U.S. 435, 440]\n\u00a0\n suant to section 310, orders specified rates thereafter to be charged, these become the only lawful rates and so remain until the further order of the secretary. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The bill shows that the secretary, after inquiry and full hearing, fixed rates thereafter to be charged by the appellees, and these had not been set aside or enjoined in any appropriate judicial proceeding or been altered by subsequent order of the secretary. The court was, therefore, without power to enjoin the prosecution of the appellees for charging rates other than those established by the secretary.\n The appellants did not raise the question of jurisdiction at the hearing below. But the lack of jurisdiction of a federal court touching the subject-matter of the litigation cannot be waived by the parties, and the District Court should, therefore, have declined sua sponte to proceed in the cause. \n10\n And if the record discloses that the lower court was without jurisdiction this court will notice the defect, although the parties make no contention concerning it. \n11\n While the District Court lacked jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction on appeal, not of the merits, but merely for the purpose of correcting the error of the lower court in entertaining the suit. \n12\n The decree must, therefore, be reversed, and the cause remanded, with dire tions to dismiss the bill.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n298 \nU.S. 692\n, 56 S.Ct. 951, 80 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 42 Stat. 159, U.S.C. tit. 7, c. 9 (7 U.S.C.A.  181-229). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Farrington v.

Cullom, of New York City, for appellees Barr Shipping c orp. et al.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On January 27, 1936, an indictment was returned in the court below, the first count of which charges that appellees, beginning with the 29th day of May, 1934, conspired to sell in the United States certain arms of war, namely, fifteen machine guns, to Bolivia, a country then engaged in armed conflict in the Chaco, in violation of the Joint Resolution of Congress approved May 28, 1934, and the provisions of a proclamation issued on the same day by the President of the United States pursuant to authority conferred by section 1 of the resolution. In pursuance of the conspiracy, the commission of certain overt acts was alleged, details of which need not be stated. The Joint Resolution (chapter 365, 48 Stat. 811) follows: \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 312]\n\u00a0\n 'Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That if the President finds that the prohibition of the sale of arms and munitions of war in the United States to those countries now engaged in armed conflict in the Chaco may contribute to the reestablishment of peace between those countries, and if after consultation with the governments of other American Republics and with their cooperation, as well as that of such other governments as he may deem necessary, he makes proclamation to that effect, it shall be unlawful to sell, except under such limitations and exceptions as the President prescribes, any arms or munitions of war in any place in the United States to the countries now engaged in that armed conflict, or to any person, company, or association acting in the interest of either country, until otherwise ordered by the President or by Congress.\n'Sec. 2. Whoever sells any arms or munitions of war in violation of section 1 shall, on conviction, be punished by a fine not exceeding $10, 000 or by imprisonment not exceeding two years, or both.'\n\n The President's proclamation (48 Stat. 1744, No. 2087), after reciting the terms of the Joint Resolution, declares:\n'Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority conferred in me by the said joint resolution of Congress, do hereby declare and proclaim that I have found that the prohibition of the sale of arms and munitions of war in the United States to those countries now engaged in armed conflict in the Chaco may contribute to the reestablishment of peace between those countries, and that I have consulted with the governments of other American Republics and have been assured of the cooperation of such governments as I have deemed necessary as contemplated by the said joint resolution; and I do hereby admonish all citizens of the \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 313]\n\u00a0\n United States and every person to abstain from every violation of the provisions of the joint resolution above set forth, hereby made applicable to Bolivia and Paraguay, and I do hereby warn them that all violations of such provisions will be rigorously prosecuted.\n\n'And I do hereby enjoin upon all officers of the United States charged with the execution of the laws thereof, the utmost diligence in preventing violations of the said joint resolution and this my proclamation issued thereunder, and in bringing to trial and punishment any offenders against the same.\n\n'And I do hereby delegate to the Secretary of State the power of prescribing exceptions and limitations to the application of the said joint resolution of May 28, 1934, as made effective by this my proclamation issued thereunder.'\n\n On November 14, 1935, this proclamation was revoked (49 Stat. 3480), in the following terms:\n'Now, therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that I have found that the prohibition of the sale of arms and munitions of war in the United States to Bolivia or Paraguay will no longer be necessary as a contribution to the reestablishment of peace between those countries, and the above-mentioned Proclamation of May 28, 1934, is hereby revoked as to the sale of arms and munitions of war to Bolivia or Paraguay from and after November 29, 1935, provided, however, that this action shall not have the effect of releasing or extinguishing any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under the aforesaid Proclamation of May 28, 1934, or the Joint Resolution of Congress approved by the President on the same date; and that the said Proclamation and Joint Resolution shall be treated as remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture or liability.' \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 314]\n\u00a0\n Appellees severally demurred to the first count of the indictment on the grounds (1) that it did not charge facts sufficient to show the commission by appellees of any offense against any law of the United States; (2) that this court of the indictment charges a conspiracy to violate the Joint Resolution and the Presidential proclamation, both of which had expired according to the terms of the Joint Resolution by reason of the revocation contained in the Presidential proclamation of November 14, 1935, and were not in force at the time when the indictment was found. The points urged in support of the demurrers were, first, that the Joint Resolution effects an invalid delegation of legislative power to the executive; second, that the Joint Resolution never became effective because of the failure of the President to find essential jurisdictional facts; and, third, that the second proclamation operated to put an end to the alleged liability under the Joint Resolution.\n\n The court below sustained the demurrers upon the first point, but overruled them on the second and third points. (D.C.) 14 F.Supp. 230. The government appealed to this court under the provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. 1246, as amended, U.S.C., title 18 ,  682 (18 U.S.C.A.  682). That act authorizes the United States to appeal from a district court direct to this court in criminal cases where, among other things, the decision sustaining a demurrer to the indictment or any count thereof is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded.\n First. It is contended that by the Joint Resolution the going into effect and continued operation of the resolution was conditioned (a) upon the President's judgment as to its beneficial effect upon the re- establishment of peace between the countries engaged in armed conflict in the Chaco; (b) upon the making of a proclama- \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 315]\n\u00a0\n tion, which was left to his unfettered discretion, thus constituting an attempted substitution of the President's will for that of Congress; (c) upon the making of a proclamation putting an end to the operation of the resolution, which again was left to the President's unfettered discretion; and (d) further, that the extent of its operation in particular cases was subject to limitation and exception by the President, controlled by no standard. In each of these particulars, appellees urge that Congress abdicated its essential functions and delegated them to the Executive.\n Whether, if the Joint Resolution had related solely to internal affairs, it would be open to the challenge that it constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the Executive, we find it unnecessary to determine. The whole aim of the resolution is to affect a situation entirely external to the United States, and falling within the category of foreign affairs. The determination which we are called to make, therefore, is whether the Joint Resolution, as applied to that situation, is vulnerable to attack under the rule that forbids a delegation of the lawmaking power. In other words, assuming (but not deciding) that the challenged delegation, if it were confined to internal affairs, would be invalid, may it nevertheless be sustained on the ground that its exclusive aim is to afford a remedy for a hurtful condition within foreign territory?\n It will contribute to the elucidation of the question if we first consider the differences between the powers of the federal government in respect of foreign or external affairs and those in respect of domestic or internal affairs. That there are differences between them, and that these differences are fundamental, may not be doubted.\n The two classes of powers are different, both in respect of their origin and their nature. The broad statement that the federal government can exercise no powers except \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 316]\n\u00a0\n those specifically enumerated in the Constitution, and such implied powers as are necessary and proper to carry into effect the enumerated powers, is categorically true only in respect of our internal affairs. In that field, the primary purpose of the Constitution was to carve from the general mass of legislative powers then possessed by the states such portions as it was thought desirable to vest in the federal government, leaving those not included in the enumeration still in the states. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238, 294\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, 865. That this doctrine applies only to powers which the states had is self-evident. And since the states severally never possessed international powers, such powers could not have been carved from the mass of state powers but obviously were transmitted to the United States from some other source. During the Colonial period, those powers were possessed exclusively by and were entirely under the control of the Crown. By the Declaration of Independence, 'the Representatives of the United States of America' declared the United (not the several) Colonies to be free and independent states, and as such to have 'full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.'\n As a result of the separation from Great Britain by the colonies, acting as a unit, the powers of external sovereignty passed from the Crown not to the colonies severally, but to the colonies in their collective and corporate capacity as the United States of America. Even before the Declaration, the colonies were a unit in foreign affairs, acting through a common agency-namely, the Continental Congress, composed of delegates from the thirteen colonies. That agency exercised the powers of war and peace, raised an army, created a navy, and finally adopted the Declaration of Independence. Rulers come and go; governments end and forms of government change; but sovereignty survives. A political society cannot endure \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 317]\n\u00a0\n without a supreme will somewhere. Sovereignty is never held in suspense. When, therefore, the external sovereignty of Great Britain in respect of the colonies ceased, it immediately passed to the Union. See Penhallow v. Doane, 3 Dall. 54, 80, 81, Fed.Cas. No. 10925. That fact was given practical application almost at once. The treaty of peace, made on September 3, 1783, was concluded between his Brittanic Majesty and the 'United States of America.' 8 Stat., European Treaties, 80.\n The Union existed before the Constitution, which was ordained and established among other things to form 'a more perfect Union.' Prior to that event, it is clear that the Union, declared by the Articles of Confederation to be 'perpetual,' was the sole possessor of external sovereignty, and in the Union it remained without change save in so far as the Constitution in express terms qualified its exercise. The Framers' Convention was called and exerted its powers upon the irrefutable postulate that though the states were several their people in respect of foreign affairs were one. Compare The Chinese Exclusion Case, \n130 \nU.S. 581, 604\n, 606 S., 9 S.Ct. 623. In that convention, the entire absence of state power to deal with those affairs was thus forcefully stated by Rufus King:\n'The states were not 'sovereigns' in the sense contended for by some. They did not possess the peculiar features of sovereignty,-they could not make war, nor peace, nor alliances, nor treaties. Considering them as political beings, they were dumb, for they could not speak to any foreign sovereign whatever. They were deaf, for they could not hear any propositions from such sovereign. They had not even the organs or faculties of defence or offence, for they could not of themselves raise troops, or equip vessels, for war.' 5 Elliot's Debates, 212.1 \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 318]\n\u00a0\n It results that the investment of the federal government with the powers of external sovereignty did not depend upon the affirmative grants of the Constitution. The powers to declare and wage war, to conclude peace, to make treaties, to maintain diplomatic relations with other sovereignties, if they had never been mentioned in the Constitution, would have vested in the federal government as necessary concomitants of nationality. Neither the Constitution nor the laws passed in pursuance of it have any force in foreign territory unless in respect of our own citizens (see American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 \nU.S. 347, 356\n, 29 S.Ct. 511, 16 Ann.Cas. 1047); and operations of the nation in such territory must be governed by treaties, international understandings and compacts, and the principles of international law. As a member of the family of nations, the right and power of the United States in that field are equal to the right and power of the other members of the international family. Otherwise, the United States is not completely sovereign. The power to acquire territory by discovery and occupation ( Jones v. United States, \n137 \nU.S. 202, 212\n, 11 S.Ct. 80), the power to expel undesirable aliens (Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 U.S. 698\n, 705 et seq., 13 S.Ct. 1016), the power to make such international agreements as do not constitute treaties in the constitutional sense (Altman & Co. v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 583, 600\n, 601 S., 32 S.Ct. 593; Crandall, Treaties, Their Making and Enforcement (2d Ed.) p. 102 and note 1), none of which is expressly affirmed by the Constitution, nevertheless exist as inherently inseparable from the conception of nationality. This the court recognized, and in each of the cases cited found the warrant for its conclusions not in the provisions of the Constitution, but in the law of nations.\n\n In Burnet v. Brooks, \n288 \nU.S. 378, 396\n, 53 S.Ct. 457, 461, 86 A.L.R. 747, we said, 'As a nation with all the attributes of sovereignty, the United States is vested with all the powers of government necessary to maintain an effective control of international relations.' Cf. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., supra, \n298 U.S. 238\n, at page 295, 56 S.Ct. 855, 865. \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 319]\n\u00a0\n Not only, as we have shown, is the federal power over external affairs in origin and essential character different from that over internal affairs, but participation in the exercise of the power is significantly limited. In this vast external realm, with its important, complicated, delicate and manifold problems, the President alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation. He makes treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate; but he alone negotiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to invade it. As Marshall said in his great argument of March 7, 1800, in the House of Representatives, 'The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations.' Annals, 6th Cong., col. 613. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations at a very early day in our history ( February 15, 1816), reported to the Senate, among other things, as follows:\n'The President is the constitutional representative of the United States with regard to foreign nations. He manages our concerns with foreign nations and must necessarily be most competent to determine when, how, and upon what subjects negotiation may be urged with the greatest prospect of success. For his conduct he is responsible to the Constitution. The committee considers this responsibility the surest pledge for the faithful discharge of his duty. They think the interference of the Senate in the direction of foreign negotiations calculated to diminish that responsibility and thereby to impair the best security for the national safety. The nature of transactions with foreign nations, moreover, requires caution and unity of design, and their success frequently depends on secrecy and dispatch.' 8 U.S.Sen.Reports Comm. on Foreign Relations, p. 24.\n\n It is important to bear in mind that we are here dealing not alone with an authority vested in the President by an \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 320]\n\u00a0\n exertion of legislative power, but with such an authority plus the very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations-a power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress, but which, of course, like every other governmental power, must be exercised in subordination to the applicable provisions of the Constitution. It is quite apparent that if, in the maintenance of our international relations, embarrassment-perhaps serious embarrassment-is to be avoided and success for our aims achieved, congressional legislation which is to be made effective through negotiation and inquiry within the international field must often accord to the President a degree of discretion and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be admissible were domestic affairs alone involved. Moreover, he, not Congress, has the better opportunity of knowing the conditions which prevail in foreign countries, and especially is this true in time of war. He has his confidential sources of information. He has his agents in the form of diplomatic, consular and other officials. Secrecy in respect of information gathered by them may be highly necessary, and the premature disclosure of it productive of harmful results. Indeed, so clearly is this true that the first President refused to accede to a request to lay before the House of Representatives the instructions, correspondence and documents relating to the negotiation of the Jay Treaty-a refusal the wisdom of which was recognized by the House itself and has never since been doubted. In his reply to the request, President Washington said:\n'The nature of foreign negotiations requires caution, and their success must often depend on secrecy; and even when brought to a conclusion a full disclosure of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions which may have been proposed or contemplated would be extremely \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 321]\n\u00a0\n impolitic; for this might have a pernicious influence on future negotiations, or produce immediate inconveniences, perhaps danger and mischief, in relation to other powers. The necessity of such caution and secrecy was one cogent reason for vesting the power of making treaties in the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, the principle on which that body was formed confining it to a small number of members. To admit, then, a right in the House of Representatives to demand and to have as a matter of course all the papers respecting a negotiation with a foreign power would be to establish a dangerous precedent.' 1 Messages and Papers of the Presidents, p. 194.\n\n The marked difference between foreign affairs and domestic affairs in this respect is recognized by both houses of Congress in the very form of their requisitions for information from the executive departments. In the case of every department except the Department of State, the resolution directs the official to furnish the information. In the case of the State Department, dealing with foreign affairs, the President is requested to furnish the information 'if not incompatible with the public interest.' A statement that to furnish the information is not compatible with the public interest rarely, if ever, is questioned.\n When the President is to be authorized by legislation to act in respect of a matter intended to affect a situation in foreign territory, the legislator properly bears in mind the important consideration that the form of the President's action-or, indeed, whether he shall act at all-may well depend, among other things, upon the nature of the confidential information which he has or may thereafter receive, or upon the effect which his action may have upon our foreign relations. This consideration, in connection with what we have already said on the subject discloses the unwisdom of requiring Congress in this field \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 322]\n\u00a0\n of governmental power to lay down narrowly definite standards by which the President is to be governed. As this court said in Mackenzie v. Hare, \n239 \nU.S. 299, 311\n, 36 S.Ct. 106, 108, Ann.Cas.1916E, 645, 'As a government, the United States is invested with all the attributes of sovereignty. As it has the character of nationality it has the powers of nationality, especially those which concern its relations and intercourse with other countries. We should hesitate long before limiting or embarrassing such powers.' (Italics supplied.)\n In the light of the foregoing observations, it is evident that this court should not be in haste to apply a general rule which will have the effect of condemning legislation like that under review as constituting an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The principles which justify such legislation find overwhelming support in the unbroken legislative practice which has prevailed almost from the inception of the national government to the present day.\n Let us examine, in chronological order, the acts of legislation which warrant this conclusion:\n The Act of June 4, 1794, authorized the President to lay, regulate and revoke embargoes. He was 'authorized' 'whenever, in his opinion, the public safety shall so require,' to lay the embargo upon all ships and vessels in the ports of the United States, including those of foreign nations, 'under such regulations as the circumstances of the case may require, and to continue or revoke the same, whenever he shall think proper.' C. 41, 1 Stat. 372. A prior joint resolution of May 7, 1794, (1 Stat. 401), had conferred unqualified power on the President to grant clearances, notwithstanding an existing embargo, to ships or vessels belonging to citizens of the United States bound to any port beyond the Cape of Good Hope.\n The Act of March 3, 1795 (c. 53, 1 Stat. 444), gave the President authority to permit the exportation of arms, cannon and military stores, the law prohibiting such ex- \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 323]\n\u00a0\n ports to the contrary notwithstanding, the only prescribed guide for his action being that such exports should be in 'cases connected with the security of the commercial interest of the United States, and for public purposes only.'\n By the Act of June 13, 1798 (c. 53,  5, 1 Stat. 566), it was provided that if the government of France 'shall clearly disavow, and shall be found to refrain from the aggressions, depredations and hostilities' theretofore maintained against vessels and property of the citizens of the United States, 'in violation of the faith of treaties, and the laws of nations, and shall thereby acknowledge the just claims of the United States to be considered as in all respects neutral, ... it shall be lawful for the President of the United States, being well ascertained of the premises, to remit and discontinue the prohibitions and restraints hereby enacted and declared; and he shall be, and is hereby authorized to make proclamation thereof accordingly.'\n By section 4 of the Act of February 9, 1799 (c. 2, 1 Stat. 615), it was made 'lawful' for the President, 'if he shall deem it expedient and consistent with the interest of the United States,' by order to remit certain restraints and prohibitions imposed by the act with respect to the French Republic, and also to revoke any such order 'whenever, in his opinion, the interest of the United States shall require.'\n Similar authority, qualified in the same way was conferred by section 6 of the Act of February 7, 1800, c. 10, 2 Stat. 9.\n Section 5 of the Act of March 3, 1805 (c. 41, 2 Stat. 341), made it lawful for the President, whenever an armed vessel entering the harbors or waters within the jurisdiction of the United States and required to depart therefrom should fail to do so, not only to employ the land and naval forces to compel obedience, but, 'if he \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 324]\n\u00a0\n shall think it proper, it shall be lawful for him to forbid, by proclamation, all intercourse with such vessel, and with every armed vessel of the same nation, and the officers and crew thereof; to prohibit all supplies and aid from being furnished them' and to do various other things connected therewith. Violation of the President's proclamation was penalized.\n On February 28, 1806, an act was passed (c. 9, 2 Stat. 351) to suspend commercial intercourse between the United States and certain parts of the Island of St. Domingo. A penalty was prescribed for its violation. Notwithstanding the positive provisions of the act, it was by section 5 (2 Stat. 352) made 'lawful' for the President to remit and discontinue the restraints and prohibitions imposed by the act at any time 'if he shall deem it expedient and consistent with the interests of the United States' to do so. Likewise in respect of the Non-intercourse Act of March 1, 1809 ( c. 24, 2 Stat. 528); the President was 'authorized' (section 11, p. 530), in case either of the countries affected should so revoke or modify her edicts 'as that they shall cease to violate the neutral commerce of the United States,' to proclaim the fact, after which the suspended trade might be renewed with the nation so doing.\n Practically every volume of the United States Statutes contains one or more acts or joint resolutions of Congress authorizing action by the President in respect of subjects affecting foreign relations, which either leave the exercise of the power to his unrestricted judgment, or provide a standard far more general than that which has always been considered requisite with regard to domestic affairs. Many, though not all, of these acts are designated in the footnote. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[299 U.S. 304, 325]\n\u00a0\n It well may be assumed that these legislative precedents were in mind when Congress passed the joint resolutions of April 22, 1898, 30 Stat. 739; March 14, 1912, 37 Stat. 630 (22 U.S.C.A.  236 and note); and January 31, 1922, 42 Stat. 361 (22 U.S.C.A.  236), to prohibit the export of coal or other war material. The resolution of 1898 authorized the President 'in his discretion, and with such limitation and exceptions as shall seem to him expedient' to prohibit such exportations. The striking identity of language found in the second resolution mentioned above and in the one now under review will be\n___ sion of hostilities abroad as may render commerce of the United States sufficiently safe. Act of April 22, 1808, c. 52, 2 Stat. 490. See, also, Act of March 3, 1817, c. 39,  2, 3 Stat. 361. Compare, but as to reviving an embargo act, the Act of May 1, 1810, c. 39,  4, 2 Stat. 605.\n Likewise, Congress has passed numerous acts laying tonnage and other duties on foreign ships, in retaliation for duties enforced on United States vessels, but providing that, if the President should be satisfied that the countervailing duties were repealed or abolished, then he might by proclamation suspend the duties as to vessels of the nation so acting. Thus, the President has been 'authorized' to proclaim the suspension. Act of January 7, 1824, c. 4,  4, 4 Stat. 3; Act of May 24, 1828, c. 111, 4 Stat. 308; Act of July 24, 1897, c. 13, 30 Stat. 214 (46 U.S.C.A.  141). On it has been provided that the suspension should take effect whenever the President 'shall be satisfied' that the discriminating duties have been abolished. Act of March 3, 1815, c. 77, 3 Stat. 224; Act of May 31, 1830, c. 219,  2, 4 Stat. 425. Or that the President 'may direct' that the tonnage duty shall cease to be levied in such circumstances. Act of July 13, 1832, c. 207,  3, 4 Stat. 578. And compare Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121,  14, 23 Stat. 53, 57.\n Other acts, for retaliation against discriminations as to United States commerce, have placed broad powers in the hands of the President, 'authorizing' even the total exclusion of vessels of any foreign country so offending (Act of June 19, 1886, c. 421,  17, 24 Stat. 79, 82, 83 (46 U.S.C.A.  142)), or the increase of duties on its goods or their total exclusion from the United States (Act of June 17, 1930, c. 497,  388, 46 Stat. 590, 704 (19 U.S.C.A.  1338)), or the exclusion of its goods or the detention, in certain circumstances, of its vessels, or the exclusion of its vessels or nationals from privileges similar to those which it has denied to citizens of the United States (Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463 ,  804-806, 39 Stat. \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 326]\n\u00a0\n seen upon comparison. The resolution of March 14, 1912 (see 22 U.S.C.A.  236 and note) provides:\n'That whenever the President shall find that in any American country conditions of domestic violence exist which are promoted by the use of arms or munitions of war procured from the United States, and shall make proclamation thereof, it shall be unlawful to export except under such limitations and exceptions as the Presi- \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 327]\n\u00a0\n dent shall prescribe any arms or munitions of war from any place in the United States to such country until otherwise ordered by the President or by Congress.\n\n'Sec. 2. That any shipment of material hereby declared unlawful after such a proclamation shall be punishable by fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding two years, or both.'\n\n The third resolution is in substantially the same terms, but extends to any country in which the United States exercises extraterritorial jurisdiction, and provides for the President's action not only when conditions of domestic violence exist which are promoted, but also when such conditions may be promoted, by the use of such arms or munitions of war.\n We had occasion to review these embargo and kindred acts in connection with an exhaustive discussion of the general subject of delegation of legislative power in a recent case, Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388, 421\n, 422 S., 55 S.Ct. 241, 249, and, in justifying such acts, pointed out that they confided to the President 'an authority which was cognate to the conduct by him of the foreign relations of the government.'\n The result of holding that the joint resolution here under attack is void and unenforceable as constituting an unlawful delegation of legislative power would be to stamp this multitude of comparable acts and resolutions as likewise invalid. And while this court may not, and should not, hesitate to declare acts of Congress, however many times repeated, to be unconstitutional if beyond all rational doubt it finds them to be so, an impressive array of legislation such as we have just set forth, enacted by nearly every Congress from the beginning of our national existence to the present day, must be given unusual weight in the process of reaching a correct determination of the problem. A legislative practice such as we have here, evidenced not by only occasional instances, \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 328]\n\u00a0\n but marked by the movement of a steady stream for a century and a half of time, goes a long way in the direction of proving the presence of unassailable ground for the constitutionality of the practice, to be found in the origin and history of the power involved, or in its nature, or in both combined.\n In The Laura, \n114 \nU.S. 411, 416\n, 5 S.Ct. 881, 883, this court answered a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to remit or mitigate fines and penalties in certain cases, by repeating the language of a very early case ( Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch 299, 309) that the long practice and acquiescence under the statute was a 'practical exposition ... too strong and obstinate to be shaken or controlled. Of course, the question is at rest, and ought not now to be disturbed.' In Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, \n111 \nU.S. 53, 57\n, 4 S.Ct. 279, 281, the constitutionality of R.S.  4952, conferring upon the author, inventor, designer or proprietor of a photograph certain rights, was involved. Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court, disposed of the point by saying: 'The construction placed upon the constitution by the first act of 1790 and the act of 1802, by the men who were contemporary with its formation, many of whom were members of the convention which framed it, is of itself entitled to very great weight, and when it is remembered that the rights thus established have not been disputed during a period of nearly a century, it is almost conclusive.'\n In Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 691\n, 12 S.Ct. 495, 504, this court declared that 'the practical construction of the constitution, as given by so many acts of congress, and embracing almost the entire period of our national existence, should not be overruled, unless upon a conviction that such legislation was clearly incompatible with the supreme law of the land.' The rule is one which has been stated and applied many times by this court. As examples, see \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 329]\n\u00a0\n Ames v. Kansas, \n111 \nU.S. 449, 469\n, 4 S.Ct. 437; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401; Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244, 286\n, 21 S.Ct. 770\n\n\n The uniform, long-continued and undisputed legislative practice just disclosed rests upon an admissible view of the Constitution which, even if the practice found far less support in principle than we think it does, we should not feel at liberty at this late day to disturb.\n We deem it unnecessary to consider, seriatim, the several clauses which are said to evidence the unconstitutionality of the Joint Resolution as involving an unlawful delegation of legislative power. It is enough to summarize by saying that, both upon principle and in accordance with precedent, we conclude there is sufficient warrant for the broad discretion vested in the President to determine whether the enforcement of the statute will have a beneficial effect upon the re-establishment of peace in the affected countries; whether he shall make proclamation to bring the resolution into operation; whether and when the resolution shall cease to operate and to make proclamation accordingly; and to prescribe limitations and exceptions to which the enforcement of the resolution shall be subject.\n Second. The second point raised by the demurrer was that the Joint Resolution never became effective because the President failed to find essential jurisdictional facts; and the third point was that the second proclamation of the President operated to put an end to the alleged liability of appellees under the Joint Resolution. In respect of both points, the court below overruled the demurrer, and thus far sustained the government.\n The government contends that, upon an appeal by the United States under the Criminal Appeals Act from a decision holding an indictment bad, the jurisdiction of the court does not extend to questions decided in favor of the United States, but that such questions may only be re- \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 330]\n\u00a0\n viewed in the usual way after conviction. We find nothing in the words of the statute or in its purposes which justify this conclusion. The demurrer in the present case challenges the validity of the statute upon three separate and distinct grounds. If the court below had sustained the demurrer without more, an appeal by the government necessarily would have brought here for our determination all of these grounds, since in that case the record would not have disclosed whether the court considered the statute invalid upon one particular ground or upon all of the grounds alleged. The judgment of the lower court is that the statute is invalid. Having held that this judgment cannot be sustained upon the particular ground which that court assigned, it is now open to this court to inquire whether or not the judgment can be sustained upon the rejected grounds which also challenge the validity of the statute and, therefore, constitute a proper subject of review by this court under the Criminal Appeals Act (18 U.S.C.A.  682). United States v. Hastings, \n296 \nU.S. 188, 192\n, 56 S.Ct. 218, 219.\n In Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531\n, 51 S.Ct. 243, where the decree of a District Court (32 F.(2d) 284) had been assailed upon two grounds and the Circuit Court of Appeals (35 F(2d) 447) had sustained the attack upon one of such grounds only, we held that a respondent in certiorari might nevertheless urge in this court in support of the decree the ground which the intermediate appellate court had rejected. That principle is applicable here.\n We proceed, then, to a consideration of the second and third grounds of the demurrers which, as we have said, the court below rejected.\n\n 1. \nThe Executive proclamation recites, 'I have found that the prohibition of the sale of arms and munitions of war in the United States to those countries now engaged in armed conflict in the Chaco may contribute to the reestablishment of peace between those countries, \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 331]\n\u00a0\n and that I have consulted with the governments of other American Republics and have been assured of the cooperation of such governments as I have deemed necessary as contemplated by the said joint resolution.' This finding satisfies every requirement of the Joint Resolution. There is no suggestion that the resolution is fatally uncertain or indefinite; and a finding which follows its language, as this finding does, cannot well be challenged as insufficient.\n But appellees, referring to the words which we have italicized above, contend that the finding is insufficient because the President does not declare that the cooperation of such governments as he deemed necessary included any American republic, and, therefore, the recital contains no affirmative showing of compliance in this respect with the Joint Resolution. The criticism seems to us wholly wanting in substance. The President recites that he has consulted with the governments of other American republics, and that he has been assured of the co-operation of such governments as he deemed necessary as contemplated by the joint resolution. These recitals, construed together, fairly include within their meaning American republics.\n\n 2. \nThe second proclamation of the President, revoking the first proclamation, it is urged, had the effect of putting an end to the Joint Resolution, and in accordance with a well-settled rule no penalty could be enforced or punishment inflicted thereafter for an offense committed during the life of the Joint Resolution in the absence of a provision in the resolution to that effect. There is no doubt as to the general rule or as to the absence of a saving clause in the Joint Resolution. But is the case presented one which makes the rule applicable?\n It was not within the power of the President to repeal the Joint Resolution; and his second proclamation did not \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 332]\n\u00a0\n purport to do so. It 'revoked' the first proclamation; and the question is, did the revocation of the proclamation have the effect of abrogating the resolution or of precluding its enforcement in so far as that involved the prosecution and punishment of offenses committed during the life of the first proclamation? We are of opinion that it did not.\n Prior to the first proclamation, the Joint Resolution was an existing law, but dormant, awaiting the creation of a particular situation to render it active. No action or lack of action on the part of the President could destroy its potentiality. Congress alone could do that. The happening of the designated events-namely, the finding of certain conditions and the proclamation by the President-did not call the law into being. It created the occasion for it to function. The second proclamation did not put an end to the law or affect what had been done in violation of the law. The effect of the proclamation was simply to remove for the future a condition of affairs which admitted of its exercise.\n We should have had a different case if the Joint Resolution had expired by its own terms upon the issue of the second proclamation. Its operative force, it is true, was limited to the period of time covered by the first proclamation. And when the second proclamation was issued. the resolution ceased to be a rule for the future. It did not cease to be the law for the antecedent period of time. The distinction is clearly pointed out by the Superior Court of Judicature of New Hampshire in Stevens v. Dimond, 6 N.H. 330, 332, 333. There, a town by-law provided that, if certain animals should be found going at large between the first day of April and the last day of October, etc., the owner would incur a prescribed penalty. The trial court directed the jury that the by-law, being in force for a year only, had expired so that the defendant could not be called upon to answer for a violation which \n\n[299 U.S. 304, 333]\n\u00a0\n occurred during the designated period. The state appellate court reversed, saying that when laws 'expire by their own limitation, or are repealed, they cease to be the law in relation to past, as well as the future, and can no longer be enforced in any case. No case is, however, to be found in which it was ever held before that they thus ceased to be law, unless they expired by express limitation in themselves, or were repealed. It has never been decided that they cease to be law, merely because the time they were intended to regulate had expired. ... A very little consideration of the subject will convince any one that a limitation of the time to which a statute is to apply, is a very different thing from the limitation of the time a statute is to continue in force.'\n The first proclamation of the President was in force from the 28th day of May, 1934, to the 14th day of November, 1935. If the Joint Resolution had in no way depended upon Presidential action, but had provided explicitly that, at any time between May 28, 1934, and November 14, 1935, it should be unlawful to sell arms or munitions of war to the countries engaged in armed conflict in the Chaco, it certainly could not be successfully contended that the law would expire with the passing of the time fixed in respect of offenses committed during the period.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the foregoing opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS does not agree. He is of opinion that the court below reached the right conclusion and its judgment ought to be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In general confirmation of the foregoing views, see 1 Story on the Constitution (4th Ed.)  198-217, and especially sections 210, 211, 213, 214, 215 (p. 153), 216. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Thus, the President has been broadly 'authorized' to suspend embargo acts passed by Congress, 'if in his judgment the public interest should require if' (Act of December 19, 1806, c. 1,  3, 2 Stat. 411), or if, 'in the judgment of the President,' there has been such suspen- \n 756, 799, 800 (15 U.S.C.A.  75-77)).

Gen., and Golden W. Bell, Asst. Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.[ United States v. Elgin, J. & E. Ry. Co. \n298 U.S. 492\n (1936) ]\n\n\n[298 U.S. 492, 495]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Nathan L. Miller, of New York City, Kemper K. Knapp, of Chicago, Ill., and Frank B. Kellogg, of St. Paul, Minn., for appellee.\n\n\n[298 U.S. 492, 497]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee, incorporated under the laws of Illinois and Indiana, has been an interstate common carrier by railroad since 1884. It operates the 'Chicago Outer Belt Line,' 195 miles long, which runs from a point on Lake Michigan, north of Chicago, around that city to South Chicago, Gary, and Porter, south and east. This line connects and interchanges freight with every railroad entering Chicago and serves many industrial plants. Among them are certain large producers of steel and steel products, operated by corporations, sometimes called 'Subsidiaries,' al of whose shares belong to the United States Steel Corporation: Illinois Steel Company, American Bridge Company, American Sheet & Tin Plate Company, National Tube Company, American Steel & Wire Company, and Cyclone Fence Company. Transportation of products-raw, semifinished, and finished-to and from and amongst the plants of the six constitutes 60 per cent. of appellee's business. It files tariffs and complies generally with the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.) and Commission regulations. During the years 1926- 1930 its annual operating revenue exceeded $20,000,000.\n The United States Steel Corporation, a holding-nonoperating- corporation organized in 1901, then acquired, and has ever since held, all shares of appellee, also all those of the producing companies.\n By an original bill filed 1930 (amended 1932) the United States instituted this proceeding against appellee, sole defendant, in the District Court, Northern Dis- \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 498]\n\u00a0\n trict of Illinois. They alleged that, by transporting articles manufactured, mined, produced, or owned by subsidiaries of the United States Steel Corporation, appellee violated the commodities clause of the Interstate Commerce Act (Act June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584, 585, U. S.C.A., title 49,  1(8)), copied in the margin,1 and asked for an injunction prohibiting such action.\n After answer, voluminous evidence, and trial, the court below made findings of fact and announced an opinion. It concluded:\n Mere ownership by the United States Steel Corporation of all shares of both appellee and a producing subsidiary was not enough to show that products made or owned by the latter were articles or commodities produced by the former, or under its authority, or which it owned in whole or in part, or in which it had an interest, direct or indirect, and was forbidden to transport by the commodities clause.\n Also 'no single piece of evidence taken alone, nor all taken together and considered as a whole warrant the inference that the defendant and the producing and manufacturing subsidiaries are under the domination, control, direction, and management of the Steel Corporation, in the sense that the defendant and the other subsidiaries are mere departments, branches, adjuncts, and instrumentalities of the Steel Corporation. The evidence fails to show that the defendant has any interest, direct or indi- \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 499]\n\u00a0\n rect, legal or equitable, in the articles or commodities which it transports for the subsidiaries of the Steel Corporation.'\n A final decree dismissed the bill for want of equity, and the cause is here by direct appeal (U.S.C.A. title 49,  45). Both conclusions are challenged and we are asked to reverse the decree and grant relief as originally prayed.\n The commodities clause became part of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1906 (U.S.C.A. title 49,  1(8)), and has remained without material change. It was first interpreted here in United States v. Delaware & Hudson Company (1909) \n213 \nU.S. 366, 415\n, 29 S.Ct. 527, 528, where, by Mr. Justice White, the Court said:\n'We then construe the statute as prohibiting a railroad company engaged in interstate commerce from transporting in such commerce articles or commodities under the following circumstances and conditions: (a) When the article or commodity has been manufactured, mined, or produced by a carrier or under its authority, and, at the time of trans ortation, the carrier has not, in good faith, before the act of transportation, dissociated itself from such article or commodity; (b) When the carrier owns the article or commodity to be transported, in whole or in part; (c) When the carrier, at the time of transportation, has an interest, direct or indirect, in a legal or equitable sense, in the article or commodity, not including, therefore, articles or commodities manufactured, mined, produced, or owned, etc., by a bona fide corporation in which the railroad company is a stockholder.'\n\n This construction has been accepted and followed in the later cases.

Co.:\n'But mere stock ownership by a railroad, or by its stockholders, in a producing company, cannot be used as a test by which to determine the legality of the transportation of such company's coal by the interstate carrier. For, when the commodity clause was under discussion, attention was called to the fact that there were a number of the anthracite roads which at that time owned stock in coal companies. An amendment was then offered which, if adopted, would have made it unlawful for any such road to transport coal belonging to such company. The amendment, however, was voted down; and, in the light of that indication of congressional intent, the commodity clause was construed to mean that it was not necessarily unlawful for a railroad company to transport coal belonging to a corporation in which the road held stock. United States ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. Delware & H. Co., 213 U.S. (366) 414, 29 S.Ct. 527, 53 L.Ed. (836) 851. For a stronger reason, it would not necessarily be illegal for the road to transport coal belonging to a corporation whose stock was held by those who owned the stock of the railroad company.'\n\n Notwithstanding the intent imputed to Congress by this opinion, announced in 1915, no amendment has been made to the commodities clause. We must therefore conclude that the interpretation of the act then accepted has legislative approval.\n It is now insisted that, although a railroad company may own the shares of a producing company and yet transport the latter's products without violating the commodities clause, if a holding company acquires the shares of both carrier and producer, then such transportation becomes illegal. The theory is that the subsidiaries of holding companies are necessarily no more than parts of it. Evidently, this is entirely out of harmony with the reasoning advanced to support the construction of the \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 501]\n\u00a0\n act adopted in United States v. Delaware & H. Co., supra; also in direct conflict with the above-quoted language from United States v. Delaware, L . & W.R. Co.\n Considering former rulings, it is impossible for us now to declare as matter of law that every company all of whose shares are owned by a holding company necessarily becomes an agent, instrumentality, or department of the latter. Whether such intimate relation exists is a question of fact to be determined upon evidence.\n Counsel for appellants submit that the record compels the inference of fact that appellee and the subsidiary producing companies are but departments of the United States Steel Corporation; and that, as in United States v. Reading Co., supra, we should find the carrier is violating the commodities clause. It is not claimed that this inference derives from any single fact, but out of the mass. The following portion of the opinion in United States v. Reading Company is heavily relied upon:\n'But the question which we have presented by this branch of the case ( alleged violation of the Commodities Clause) is not the technical one of whether ownership by a railroad company of stock in a coal company renders it unlawful for the former to carry the product of the latter, for here the railroad company did not own any of the stock of the coal company. The real question is whether combining in a single corporation the ownership of all of the stock of a carrier and of all of the stock of a coal company results in such community of interest or title in the product of the latter as to bring the case within the scope of the provisions of the act.'\n\n And, having regard to this, they say: 'The affirmative answer given in the Reading Case is controlling here.'\n Obviously, what was there stated cannot be taken as declaration of an abstract principle; it had application \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 502]\n\u00a0\n to the relevant circumstances. Later (\n253 U.S. 26\n, at pages 61, 62, 40 S. Ct. 425, 434) in the same opinion the essential ones are revealed:\n'All three of the Reading Companies had the same officers and directors and it was under their authority that the mines were worked and the railroad operated, and they exercised that authority in the one case in precisely the same character as in the other-as officials of the Holding Company. The manner in which the stock of the three was held resulted and was intended to result, in the abdication of all independent corporate action by both the Railway Company and the Coal Company, involving as it did the surrender to the Holding Company of the entire conduct of their affairs. It would be to subordinate reality to legal form to hold that the coal mined by the Coal Company, under direction of the Holding Company's officials, was not produced by the same 'authority' that operated the Reading Railway lines.'\n\n If the evidence here showed the relationship between the holding company, the carrier, and the producing companies to be substantially as in the Reading Case, that opinion well might be regarded as controlling. But there is material difference, and we must look elsewhere for guidance.\n Properly to appraise the situation now presented, particular attention must be given to the following facts: All shares of appellee and the subsidiary producing companies have been owned by the United States Steel Corporation since 1901. The railroad has been under constant supervision by the Interstate Commerce Commission. In the Matter of Alleged Rebates to the United States Steel Corporation (1915) 36 I.C.C. 557. It functions as a separate corporate carrier under imme- \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 503]\n\u00a0\n diate control of its own directors, no one of whom is on the board of the holding company; it owns all necessary equipment, makes its own contracts, manages its own finances, serves its patrons without discrimination, and apparently to their satisfaction. The lawfulness of the relationship between the holding company and subsidiaries was challenged in United States v. United States Steel Corporation, \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 40 S.Ct. 293, 8 A.L.R. 1121, decided here in 1920. After long and thorough investigation and consideration, this court held the Anti-Trust Act was not being violated. The present proceeding is one to prevent probable future unlawful conduct and not to punish acts long since completed, however reprehensible. 'Our consideration should be of, not what the corporation had power to do or did, but what it has now power to do and is doing.' United States v. United States Steel Corporation, supra, \n251 U.S. 417\n, at page 444, 40 S.Ct. 293, 296, 8 A.L.R. 1121\n\n\n The court below made definite findings of fact, and upon them reached the conclusions stated above. Although criticized, and notwithstanding certain isolated acts may indicate undue control over the carrier at their dates, we think that the findings are essentially correct and support the decree. Instances of participation in the affairs of the appellee by the officers of the United States Steel Corporation, stressed by counsel, are relatively few; a material part of them occurred years ago-some of the m re important in 1909. They are not adequate to support the claim that appellee must be regarded as the alter ego of its sole stockholder. The mere power to control, the possibility of initiating unlawful conditions, is not enough, as clearly pointed out in United States v. Delaware & H. Co ., supra. That a stockholder should show concern about the company's affairs, ask for reports, sometimes consult with its officers, give advice, and even \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 504]\n\u00a0\n object to proposed action is but the natural outcome of a relationship not inhibited by the commodities clause.\n We find no adequate reason for disapproving the challenged decree, and it must be\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be reversed.\n The language of the commodities clause, read in the light of its legislative history, can leave no doubt that its purpose was to withhold from every interstate rail carrier the inducement and facility for favoritism and abuse of its powers as a common carrier, which experience had shown are likely to occur when a single business interest occupies the inconsistent position of carrier and shipper. See United States v. Reading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 26, 60\n, 61 S., 40 S.Ct. 425. Before the enactment of the commodities clause, Congress, by sweeping prohibitions, had made unlawful every form of rebate to shippers and every form of discrimination in carrier rates, service, and facilities, injurious to shippers or the public. By the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note, it had forbidden combinations in restraint of interstate commerce. But it did not stop there. The commodities clause was aimed, not at the practices of railroads already penalized, but at the suppression of the power and the favorable opportunity, inseparable from actual control of both shipper and carrier by the same interest, to engage in practices already forbidden and others inimical to the performance of carrier duties to the public. See Delaware, L. & W.R. Co. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 363, 370\n, 34 S.Ct. 65; United States v. Reading Co., supra.\n It is not denied that the 'indirect' interest of the carrier in the commodity transported, at which the statute strikes, may be effected through the instrumentality of a \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 505]\n\u00a0\n holding company which owns the stock both of the carrier and the company which manufactures and ships the commodity. This was definitely established by the decision in United States v. Reading Co., supra, where it was held that the power of control through holding company ownership of all the capital stock both of an interstate rail carrier and a shipper producing the commodity carried, plus an active exercise of that control, are enough to make the transportation unlawful.\n While it was recognized, as had been held in United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366\n, 29 S.Ct. 527, that mere ownership, by a carrier or a shipper, of the stock of the other, does not call the statute into operation, the Court was careful to point out, \n253 U.S. 26\n, at pages 62, 63, 40 S.Ct. 425, 434, that, 'where such ownership of stock is resorted to, not for the purpose of participating in the affairs of the corporation in which it is held in a manner normal and usual with stockholders, but for the purpose of making it a mere agent, or instrumentality or department of another company, the courts will look through the forms to the realities of the relation between the companies as if the corporate agency did not exist and will deal with them as the justice of the case may require.' Domination in fact by a holding company both of the rail carrier and the producing shipper of commodities, in addition to its legal power to dominate them, is enough to bring the carrier within the prohibition of the commodities clause.\n The only question for our decision is whether the complete power of the United States Steel Corporation, through stock ownership, to dominate both appellee and certain shippers over its lines, has been exercise sufficiently to exemplify the evil which the commodities clause was intended to prevent, and so to bring appellee within its condemnation. It is of no consequence that complaints of rebates by appellee to United States Steel \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 506]\n\u00a0\n Corporation subsidiaries have not been sustained, In the Matter of Alleged Rebates to the United States Steel Corporation, 36 I.C.C. 557, or that the Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries have been held not to infringe the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. United States v. United States Steel Corporation, \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 40 S.Ct. 293, 8 A.L.R. 1121. The commodities clause does not forbid rebating or attempts to monopolize interstate commerce, which are dealt with by other statutes. It is concerned with transportation of commodities by a rail carrier where the carrier and the producer and shipper are so dominated by the same interest, through the exercise of power secured by stock ownership, as to make rebates, discriminations, attempts to monopolize, and other abuses of carrier power easy, and their detection and punishment difficult.\n It is not important, as the court below thought, that in the relations between the Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries 'there was a scrupulous recognition of the separate entities,' or that all transactions between them were 'in the form of transactions and communications between two separate and distinct corporations,' or that the business and accounts of each subsidiary 'were kept separate and distinct' from those of others. Nor is it of any moment, as this Court seems to imply, that the affiliates do not have the same officers and directors, and that some years ago they abandoned the practice of maintaining interlocking directorates.\n Those familiar with present-day methods of corporate control with not be so naive as to suppose that the complete domination in fact of its subsidiaries by a holding company owning all their stock is in any way inconsistent with scrupulous recognition of their separate corporate entities, or with the maintenance of separate accounts and distinct personnels of officers and directors. Every holding company presupposes a relationship between it and a distinct corporate entity and its power to control the \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 507]\n\u00a0\n latter. Where the issue is whether that power has been exercised, 'courts will look through the forms to the realities of the relation between the companies as if the corporate agencies did not exist.' Hence we are presently concerned with what is in fact done in the Steel Corporation's exercise of its power to control, not with the particular legal forms or methods under cover of which control may in fact be effected. And, since we must look to its acts of control, in addition to its power acquired by stock ownership, as the decisive test, we must scrutinize what has occurred in the past as the best indication of the manner and extent of the use which may be made of the power in the future.\n In appraising the Steel Corporation's acts of control over the appellee, it is of significance that the dominant interest in the intercompany relationship, unlike that in the earlier case brought before the Court, is that of production and not transportation. Appellee, although a common carrier, subject to public duties and responsibilities, is, in its relation to the Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries, but an appanage to their vast steel-producing business. While the commodities clause makes no distinction between the one type of domination and the other, such control of a railroad is far more menacing to the public and to rival producers than is domination of producer interests by a carrier. When the carrier interest predominates, extension of its transportation facilities beyond the demands of its producing affiliates, and even to their competitors, with resulting benefit to the public, may well ensue. But, where the producing interest is dominant, and the carrier is chiefly engaged in transporting the commodities of producing affiliates, restricted or indiffer nt service to competing producers and to the public, tardy or inadequate extension of facilities, discrimination in furnishing service and facilities, are dangers especially to be anticipated. \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 508]\n\u00a0\n In such a relationship, control of carrier capital accumulation, expansion, and expenditure, is a peculiarly convenient and effective means of subordinating carrier public service to the interests of production, by restriction of carrier expansion which would benefit the public and competing producers, or by allowing it only under discriminatory conditions. It is with these general considerations in mind, especially pertinent to the present case, that its facts should be a examined.\n Since its formation in 1901, the Steel Corporation has owned all the capital stock of the appellee railroad and of the Illinois Steel Company, a manufacturing company which appellee serves. Through lease, in 1909, of the Chicago, Lake Shore & Eastern Railway line, and the acquisition of appurtenant trackage rights over another line, appellee secured and maintains direct transportation facilities between the Illinois Steel Company and mines and quarries, all subsidiaries of the Steel Corporation. Sixty per cent. of appellee's tonnage is furnished by Steel Corporation subsidiaries.\n Although the Steel Corporation is exclusively a holding and not an operating company, its by-law defining the president's duties provide that he 'shall have general charge of the business of the corporation relating to manufacturing, mining and transportation.' The record shows that this authority is exercised by close and constant supervision over the business and affairs of Steel Corporation subsidiaries, not through the formal proceedings of stockholders and directors meetings, but through conferences and correspondence taking place directly between the officers of the Steel Corporation and those of its subsidiaries.\n From 1901 to 1920 there were on appellee's board of directors never less than four officers or directors of the Steel Corporation, selected from its most important officers. Since 1920 the appellee's board of directors has \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 509]\n\u00a0\n been selected by appellee's president and elected by him acting as proxy for the Steel Corporation. He has likewise selected the officers, who have been elected by the Board at his suggestion. The record is replete with evidence, chiefly correspondence, showing the complete subservience of appellee's president to the officers of the Steel Corporation in matters of corporate policy. The subservience of appellee's board of directors to its president, and through him in turn to the Steel Corporation, is exemplified by appellee's settled practice from 1910 until the time of suit of entering into contracts without any previous approval by its board of directors. At its annual meeting of directors the contracts which have been previously entered into, and often have already been performed, are ratified and confirmed. This procedure was followed with respect to all contracts, some 2,313 in number, executed on behalf of appellee between 1910 and 1933.\n Appellee's fiscal policy has for many years been dominated and rigidly controlled by the Steel Corporation. Dividends have been habitually declared and the amount of them fixed only after securing, by correspondence, the consent and approval of the officers of the Steel Corporation. The Steel Corporation draws to itself the surplus funds of its subsidiaries, including appellee, which are deposited with it, for its own use, often upon its specific request or demand, and at a rate of interest which it fixes. These funds are withdrawn by draft of the subsidiary, payable only upon acceptance by the Steel Corporation, and customarily upon notice given in advance. From 1920 to 1933 appellee's aggregate deposits with the Steel Corporation were $79,000,000, of which $ 32,000,000 were made at the request or demand of the Steel Corporation.\n Since its formation the Steel Corporation has maintained under its direction and control a clearance account, by which monthly settlement is made of intercompany \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 510]\n\u00a0\n accounts among its various subsidiaries. All of appellee's settlements of such accounts, except freight charges and traffic claims, are cleared through this account. The account is managed by the controller of the Steel Corporation. Interest is charged or allowed on balances due in the account at a rate of interest fixed by the treasurer of the Steel Corporation. Terms of settlement are controlled by it and not by free bargaining of debtor and creditor.\n By direction of the finance committee of the Steel Corporation, its subsidiaries, including appellee, are required to obtain in advance the approval of the committee of all expenditures for capital account and improvements in excess of a specified amount. From 1920 to 1932 the limit was $10,000, since which it has been $5,000. Since 1908 the officers of the Steel Corporation have issued from time to time, to all its subsidiaries, instructions outlining in detail the rules and procedure governing their application to the Steel Corporation for its approval of their expenditures for improvements. This requirement was not perfunctory. Failure to secure from the officers of the Steel Corporation, in advance, the approval of capital expenditures, brought from them by letter or telegram swift reminder of the neglect. Requests for approval of proposed expenditures have been the occasion for careful inquiry by the officers of the Steel Corporation as to their necessity and propriety. In recent years approximately 70 per cent. of appellee's total capital expenditures have been of the class requiring consent by the Steel Corporation.* Included were items directly \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 511]\n\u00a0\n affecting appellee's transportation service, such as the cost of rolling stock, procuring an adequate water supply for its engines, improvement of its right of way, and additional yard facilities.\n With such minute and continuous control of capital outlays of appellee by an organization primarily interested in production rather than common carrier service, it is not surprising that the only expansion of appellee during the period of control has been its lease of the line of the Chicago, Lake Shore & Eastern Railway, a subsidiary of a Steel Corporation producing affiliate, the Illinois Steel Company, which it served almost exclusively, and the acquisition through this lease of a trackage privilege over the Chicago & Eastern Illinois Railroad, restricted to the hauling of products of producing subsidiaries of the Steel Corporation-an arrangement by which appellee raised its tonnage from subsidiaries of the Steel Corporation from 25 per cent. to 60 per cent.\n It was the chairman of the board of the Steel Corporation, not the officers of appellee, who had the deciding voice in determining whether the lease should be taken and who assumed active control of the negotiations for its acquisition. Again, in 1920, when the trackage agreement was subject to cancellation by reason of the receivership of the Chicago & Eastern Illinois, it was the chairman of the board of the Steel Corporation who actively controlled the successful negotiation for a continuance of the agreement.\n The record discloses many other forms of actual control of the business and affairs of appellee by the Steel Corporation which it is unnecessary to detail. It is enough that those mentioned, when examined in their setting, show with convincing force that the appellee railroad is in fact obedient to the dominating control of producer of commodities which it transports. In every instance when the Steel Corporation has conceived that it had any \n\n[298 U.S. 492, 512]\n\u00a0\n interest to subserve, appellee has willingly done its bidding. In none has there been any indication of a disposition to pursue any policy not at least tacitly approved by the Steel Corporation. The active and continuous control over appellee's finances and expenditures is alone sufficient to create a continuing danger of neglect and abuse of appellee's carrier duties in favor of the dominating production and shipping interest, a temptation and an opportunity which it was the purpose of the commodities clause to forestall. In addition, the Steel Corporation has exerted that power, in the acquisition of the Lake Shore lease and its appurtenant trackage rights, to secure special advantages for its producing subsidiaries. The trackage rights extend only to hauling their own product, not that of their rivals.\n This relationship passes far beyond that which is normal between a railroad and its stockholders and establishes a control over appellee's policy as complete as though it were but a department of the Steel Corporation. If the commodities clause permits control such as is exhibited here, one is at a loss to say what scope remains for the operation of the statute. Whatever views may be entertained of the soundness and wisdom of the decision in United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., supra, it neither requires nor excuses our reduction of the commodities clause to a cipher in the calculations of those who control the railroads of the country.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] From and after May first, nineteen hundred and eight, it shall be unlawful for any railroad company to transport from any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, to any other State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, or to any foreign country, any article or commodity, other than timber and the manufactured products thereof, manufactured, mined, or produced by it, or under its authority, or which it may own in whole or in part, or in which it may have any interest, direct or indirect, except such articles or commodities as may be necessary and intended for its use in the conduct of its business as a common carrier. \n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Out of an annual average capital expenditure by appellee of approximately $900,000, during each of the years from 1926 to 1930 inclusive, an average of over $600,000 annually required the prior approval of the Steel Corporation. In 1930, appellee made capital expenditures of $1,910,755, of which $1,315,773 required the approval of the Steel Corporation. Appellee's total capital expenditures from 1926 to 1930 amounted to $4,597,925, of which $3,153,817 required such approval. \n\n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Myers, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent is a citizen and resident of the French Republic and authorized to sue the United States in the Court of Claims. \n1\n His amended complaint alleges a cause of action under the Act of June 25, 1910, as amended,2 for the use and manufacture by or for the United States of a device covered by his patent No. 1,115,795 dated November 3, 1914, which describes means for the control of the equilibrium of airplanes by the simple oscillation of a single lever moving in all directions and operated by one hand. Defendant filed a general traverse. After taking evidence, the court made special findings and stated as its conclusion of law that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. It did not specifically find the patent valid or that defendant infringed it. The record does not show whether at first the conclusion of law contained any statement as to validity or infringement. Pursuant \n\n[299 U.S. 201, 203]\n\u00a0\n to stipulation and in accordance with its rule, the court postponed entry of final judgment pending the taking of testimony upon the question of compensation. \n3\n On defendant's motion, the court amended its conclusion of law to read: 'Upon the foregoing special findings of fact, which are made a part of the judgment herein, the court decides as a conclusion of law that the plaintiff's patent is valid and has been infringed by the United States and that he is entitled to compensation therefor under the act of June 25, 1910.' It filed an opinion in which it states: 'In conclusion we hold that the patent in suit is valid and has been infringed by the defendant.' 81 Ct.Cl. 785. The court entered judgment in accordance with the amended conclusion of law. We granted writ of certiorari. \n4\n\u00a0\n298 \nU.S. 653\n, 56 S.Ct. 953\n\n\n Plaintiff's contentions are based on claims 2 and 5 to 9. Claim 2 is: 'An aeroplane having distortable wings for maintaining transverse stability, a rudder for maintaining longitudinal stability, a lever controlling said wings and said rudder, a steering rudder, and a separate lever controlling said steering rudder.' Claim 5 is: 'In an aeroplane, the combination of means for producing \n\n[299 U.S. 201, 204]\n\u00a0\n lateral stability, means for producing longitudinal stability and a single vertical lever movable in every direction for operating both said means for producing lateral stability and said means for producing longitudinal stability.' Each of the other claims relied on contains the substance of claim 5 with variations and additions not here important.\n On the facts found the petitioner contends: Respondent's patent is invalid as claiming a device not patentable over prior disclosures. No element of invention is found in the asserted instinctive character of the operation of the control lever. The patent, if held valid in any respect, should be limited to a combination comprising a pair of vertical control levers with a single integral or unitary tail surface of an airplane, and so construed is not infringed. The vertical control lever did not constitute invention over the structure disclosed in the respondent's 1906 French patent, application for which was filed more than one year before that for the patent in suit. \n5\n The claims are not supported by the disclosure. Plaintiff's patent is invalid because the claims on the control lever were not inserted in the application until five and one-half years after filing, while the device came into general use in the United Stats prior to that time. \n\n[299 U.S. 201, 205]\n\u00a0\n Validity and infringement are ultimate facts on which depends the question of liability. \n6\n In actions at law they are to be decided by the jury. If the evidence is not sufficient to establish validity and infringement, it is the duty of the trial court to direct a verdict for defendant. \n7\n Similarly a judgment upon a special verdict cannot be sustained unless the findings extend to all material issues. \n8\n The same principle governs in cases brought here from the Court of Claims. \n9\n On writ of certiorari to that court, the record is required to include the pleadings, findings of fact and the judgment. The opinion, if any, is also included. The findings are required to be in the nature of a special verdict and specifically to set forth the ultimate facts; the evidence is not brought up. \n10\n As by its general traverse defendant put in issue all allegations of the complaint, the findings in order to be sufficient to sustain judgment for plaintiff must specifically decide questions of validity and infringement, and also include circumstantial facts sufficient to warrant the court's conclu- \n\n[299 U.S. 201, 206]\n\u00a0\n sion in respect of the main issues. \n11\n The special findings may not be aided by statements in the conclusions of law12 or the opinion of the court13 to the effect that the patent is valid and infringed.\n The court having failed to find that the patent was valid or had been infringed, the judgment cannot be sustained unless upon inspection of the findings of fact it is plain that they are sufficient to compel decision of those issues in favor of plaintiff. \n14\n The contentions of the parties- briefly above indicated-raise complicated and difficult questions affecting validity and infringement. There are 47 findings of fact covering more than 32 pages of the record and by reference including 28 exhibits on 266 pages. The failure of the lower court to make specific findings upon the main issues does not lay upon this court the duty of examining, analyzing and comparing the circumstantial facts found to ascertain whether as a matter of law they establish validity and infringement. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment will be vacated, the case wll be remanded to the Court of Claims for such proceedings in harmony with this opinion as that court may determine, \n\n[299 U.S. 201, 207]\n\u00a0\n and with instructions that it specifically find whether plaintiff's patent in suit was valid and, if found valid, whether it was infringed by the defendant. \n 16\n\u00a0\n\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Judicial Code,  155, 28 U.S.C.  261 (28 U.S.C.A.  261). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 851, as amended by Act ofJuly 1, 1918, 40 Stat. 705, 35 U.S.C.  68 (35 U.S.C.A.  68). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'In any patent suit it shall be competent for the parties to stipulate that the hearing in the first instane be limited to the issues of validity and infringement and when no such stipulation can be reached by the parties the court may order such procedure to be followed.\n'If the patent is held valid and infringed by the United States the court shall so adjudge and the case shall thereafter proceed according to law.'

RESNICK(1936)\nNo. 62\nArgued: November 13, 1936Decided: December 7, 1936\n\n\n\n Appeals from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and William \n\n[299 U.S. 207, 208]\n\u00a0\n W. Barron, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Messrs. Samuel L. Einhorn and John Arthur Brown, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellees Charles and Joseph Resnick.\n Messrs. D. Alexander Wieland and John Arthur Brown, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellees Acme Can Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellees were indicted for violations of the Act of May 21, 1928, 45 Stat. 685, 15 U.S.C.,  257-257i (15 U.S.C.A.  257-257i). In No. 62, the indictment is in four counts, each of which charges that defendants sold for fruits and vegetables two-quart metal hampers which did not comply with the act in that they were not of any standard size authorized by the act and did not come within any tolerance established by the Secretary of Agriculture. In No. 63, the indictment is in two counts. The first charges that defendant manufactured two-quart metal hampers that were not of any authorized size or within prescribed tolerances without having submitted dimension specifications to the Secretary. The second charges sale of them. In each case, the accused demurred upon the ground that the facts alleged are not sufficient to constitute a violation of the act. The court sustained the demurrers and discharged the defendants. The United States appealed. 18 U.S.C.  682 (18 U.S.C.A.  682).\n Section 1 of the Act (15 U.S.C.A.  257) declares that 'the standard hampers ... for fruits and vegetables shall be of the following capacities,' and specifies nine sizes based upon a bushel of 2150.42 cubic inches. The sizes so defined are one-eighth, one-fourth, one-half, five- eighths, three-fourths, one bushel, one and one-fourth, one and one-half, and two bushels. Computed according to the standard \n\n[299 U.S. 207, 209]\n\u00a0\n fixed, the capacity of a two-quart hamper is 134.4 cubic inches. Section 3 ( 15 U.S.C.A.  257b) directs the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe such tolerances as he may find necessary to allow in the capacities set forth in section 1. Section 4 (15 U.S.C.A.  257c) commands that 'no manufacturer shall manufacture hampers ... unless the dimension specifications ... shall have been submitted to and approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, who is hereby directed to approve such specifications if he finds that hampers ... made in accordance therewith would not be deceptive in appearance and would comply with' section 1. Section 5 (15 U.S.C.A.  257d) makes it 'unlawful to manufacture for sale ... (or) to sell ... hampers ... for fruits or vegetables ... that do not comply with this Act (subdivision of this chapter).' Any one 'that violates this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.'\n The question is whether the provisions of the act are effective to make the manufacture or sale of two-quart hampers punishable as a crime. The nine sizes standardized in section 1 are the only ones within section 4. The Secretary was not authorized by section 3 to prescribe tolerances in respect to two-quart hampers, and has not attempted to do so. The indictments must be construed to charge merely manufacture and sale of hampers each of capacity of two quarts, one-sixteenth of a bushel, 134.4 cubic inches. They do not charge that any such hamper purported to be of any size defined by section 1, or was in any respect liable to deceive. It follows that, unless the clause of section 5 which forbids manufacture or sale of containers 'that do not comply with this Act' makes criminal the manufacture or sale of two-quart hampers, the facts alleged do not constitute any offense.\n Statutes creating crimes are to be strictly construed in favor of the accused; they may not be held to extend to cases not covered by the words used. United States v. \n\n[299 U.S. 207, 210]\n\u00a0\n Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95; Fasulo v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 620, 628\n, 47 S.Ct. 200, 201. The clause just quoted is crucial; its words are plain and, having regard to the connection in which they are used, must be given the meaning naturally attributable to them. It is obvious that they do not extend to hampers other than the nine classes defined in section 1. The act applies to none of capacity less than four quarts. Pacific States Box & Basket Co. v. White, \n296 \nU.S. 176, 183\n, 56 S.Ct. 159, 162, 101 A.L.R. 853. It expresses no condemnation of two-quart hampers. Before one may be punished, it must appear that his case is plainly within the statute; there are no constructive offenses. United States v. Lacher, \n134 \nU.S. 624, 628\n, 10 S.Ct. 625; United States v. Chase, \n135 \nU.S. 255, 261\n, 10 S.Ct. 756; Fasulo v. United States, supra, \n272 U.S. 620\n, at page 629, 47 S.Ct. 200, 202. As in absence of governmental regulation the making and selling of containers is untrammeled, failure expressly to permit is not to prohibit. Mere standardization of a bushel container at 2150.42 cubic inches would not make criminal the manufacture or sale of a half-bushel container having capacity of 1075.21 cubic inches. The prescribing of capacities of containers described in section 1 does not prohibit manufacture or sale of the two-quart hampers described in these indictments.\n The judgments sustaining the demurrers and discharging the accused must be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. RIZZO(1936)\nNo. 272\nArgued: January 9, 1936Decided: March 9, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 530, 531]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr., of Boston, Mass., for the United States.\n Mr. Milton R. Kroopf, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In December, 1932, a cargo of alcohol was seized by Customs and Coast Guard officials acting together; and the United States filed, in the federal court for New Jersey, a libel in admiralty praying forfeiture for violation of the customs and navigation laws. Rizzo, as claimant, filed an answer. A decree of forfeiture was entered on the ground that the cargo was carried on a vessel employed in a trade other than that for which she was licensed. The Court of Appeals reversed, citing United States v. Chambers, \n291 \nU.S. 217\n, 54 S.Ct. 434, 89 A.L.R. 1510. While the government's petition for \n\n[297 U.S. 530, 532]\n\u00a0\n a rehearing, later denied, was pending, that court ordered, upon application by Rizzo for sale of the alcohol, that it be sold, 'free and clear of all claims of any kind or character'; that the proceeds be deposited in the registry; and that they 'be substituted in the place and stead of said 146,157 gallons of alcohol, and that all further proceedings herein shall be against said proceeds of sale.'\n The marshal sold the alcohol for $1.85 per wine gallon. In confirming the sale, the court ordered (1) that the alcohol be delivered to the purchaser free of all government taxes or tax liens and customs duties; (2) that it 'shall be treated by the United States Government and any of its departments as tax paid, irrespective of the lack of any stamp or tax certificate affixed thereto on the respective containers in which said alcohol may be deposited or contained'; and (3) that the proceeds of sale be paid into the registry of the court. We denied a writ of certiorari, sought on the ground that the Circuit Court of Appeals lacked authority to include the provision regarding taxes in its order of confirmation. \n294 \nU.S. 709\n, 55 S.Ct. 406\n\n\n Thereupon the United States filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals a petition asking that the proceeds of the sale be paid into the Treasury of the United States in satisfaction of the lien for taxes due on the alcohol; made proof that the taxes exceeded the proceeds of the sale; and filed with the clerk notices of levy and warrant for distraint. The court ruled that the petition could not be entertained, because the government had failed to raise the question of taxes when it filed it libel, but had waited until after denial of certiorari to seek such relief. Accordingly, the Court directed that the proceeds be paid to he claimant or his assigns. \n1\n To review this order we granted certiorari; a misconstruction of the statutes \n\n[297 U.S. 530, 533]\n\u00a0\n concerning tax liens and a departure from the usual course of proceedings being charged. \n296 \nU.S. 559\n, 56 S.Ct. 124.\n First. Rizzo does not attempt here to support the order on the ground stated by the Court of Appeals. Nor could he well do so. The claim for taxes, being nonmaritime, could not have been set forth in the libel. Compare The Steamboat Orleans v. Phoebus, 11 Pet. 175, 182. To defer presenting the claims for taxes until after the final decree adjudicating the right to the property was not dilatory conduct. Obviously, there would have been no occasion to proceed against the property for collection of the tax if the alcohol had been declared forfeit to the United States.\n Second. Rizzo contends that the tax sought to be recovered is a penalty imposed for violation of the National Prohibition Act (27 U.S.C.A .); hence uncollectible, because of the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. United States v. Chambers, \n291 \nU.S. 217\n, 54 S.Ct. 434, 89 A. L.R. 1510. But this tax is not a penalty. It is the basic tax upon distilled spirits, irrespective of their legal or illegal origin. United States v. One Ford Coupe, \n272 \nU.S. 321, 328\n, 47 S.Ct. 154, 47 A.L.R. 1025; Various Items of Personal Property v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 577, 579\n, 51 S.Ct. 282. A lien attaches to alcohol 'as soon as it is in existence as such' and continues until the tax is paid. Rev.Stat.  3248 (26 U.S.C.A.  1150(c), 1158(b)(1), and section 3251; Thompson v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 471, 474\n, 12 S.Ct. 299. That lien is valid against all transferees, without assessment, distraint, or other administrative proceedings. Alkan v. Bean, 1 Fed.Cas. page 418, No. 202; United States v. Turner, 28 Fed.Cas. page 232, No. 16,548.\n Rizzo objects here that the alcohol does not appear to have been of domestic manufacture. His answer in the District Court stated that it was not imported; and there is no showing that it was. As the alcohol was subject to the tax, the burden rested upon him to prove payment. Rev.Stat .  3333, as amended (26 U.S.C.A.  1205). No evidence to that effect was introduced. The contrary was established. \n\n[297 U.S. 530, 534]\n\u00a0\n Third. Rizzo contends that the United States is estopped from collecting the tax, because it elected to seek forfeiture for violation of the National Prohibition Act. But the government made no such attempt. The libel sought forfeiture on four grounds. Three of them were for violation of provisions in the Tariff Act of 1930, June 17, 1930, c. 497, 46 Stat. 590 (19 U.S.C.A.  1001 et seq.). The fourth was for violation of the navigation laws. Rev.Stat.  4377 (46 U.S.C.A.  325). The District Court decreed forfeiture on the fourth ground, without passing on the other three. The petition presented to the Circuit Court of Appeals has no relation to navigation or customs laws. It states a claim based solely upon the internal revenue laws. The present proceeding is thus founded on a right distinct from, and entirely consistent with, the rights theretofore asserted. Compare United States v. One Ford Coupe, \n272 \nU.S. 321, 327\n, 333 S., 334, 47 S.Ct. 154, 47 A.L.R. 1025. No reference was made in the libel, and no evidence was introduced in the District Court, with respect to the tax due upon the domestic production of alcohol. There is no basis for the contention that the United States is estopped by an election of remedies. Compare Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogert, 250u.S. 483, 490, 491, 39 S.Ct. 533.\n Fourth. Rizzo contends that the United States is also barred because its counsel agreed, when the terms of sale were framed, that the proceeds should be answerable only to the causes of forfeiture set forth in the libel nd that any tax lien should be waived. There was no such agreement. The notice of the 'terms and conditions under which the sale will be conducted' (to which counsel for the Government is alleged to have consented) recited: '3. The cargo of alcohol which is being sold is to be sold free and clear of all claims of any kind or character.' The order of sale had provided that 'all further proceedings herein shall be against said proceeds of sale.' Thus it was in the common form authorized by Admiralty Rule 40 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723), which is interpreted as transferring all existing liens \n\n[297 U.S. 530, 535]\n\u00a0\n from property to proceeds. Compare The Lottawanna, 20 Wall. 201, 211, 221; Schuchardt v. Babbidge, 19 How. 239, 241. Since counsel did not agree to waive the tax lien on the proceeds, and since the Court of Appeals made no finding of such a waiver, we need not consider whether a United States attorney had authority to waive the government's right. Compare Utah v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 534, 545\n, 546 S., 52 S.Ct. 232.\n Fifth. Rizzo contends that the Circuit Court of Appeals sitting in admiralty lacks jurisdiction to enforce the lien for taxes. The argument is that collection of internal revenue taxes must be effected in accordance with prescribed statutory methods; and that the Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27,  1115, 44 Stat. 117, and Rev.Stat.  838 (28 U.S.C.A.  486), provides specifically for collection by the collector of internal revenue through proceedings specified. But compare Rev.Stat.  3213, (26 U. S.C.A.  1644, 1645(a, c). The order of the appellate court confirming the sale deprived the government of two of the statutory methods: First, the right to forfeit the alcohol even after it had been transferred to a bona fide purchaser while in a container not properly stamped, Act of January 11, 1934, c. 1, title 2,  206, 48 Stat. 317 (26 U.S.C.A.  1152f); second, the right to collect the taxes from the purchaser under the court's order, Rev.Stat.  3334, as amended by Act of March 1, 1879, c. 125,  5, 20 Stat. 340 (26 U.S.C.A.  1154). But, in ordering sale of the alcohol free of liens, the Court of Appeals in effect provided, in accord with the common practice, that existing liens should attach to the proceeds. Compare Terre Haute & L.R. Co. v. Harrison (C.C.A.) 96 F. 907, 911. These being in custodia legis, it was proper to petition that they be applied towards satisfaction of the tax. Compare Marshall v. New York, \n254 \nU.S. 380, 384\n, 385 S., 41 S.Ct. 143; In re Tyler, \n149 \nU.S. 164, 182\n, 183 S., 187, 13 S.Ct. 785. The practice prevails in admiralty as in other courts. In Schuchardt v. Babbidge, 19 How. 239, 241, where proceeds of the sale of a mortgaged ship had been paid into the registry, \n\n[297 U.S. 530, 536]\n\u00a0\n the Court, refusing to entertain a 'libel simply to foreclose a mortgage, or to enforce the payment of a mortgage,' said: 'As the fund is in the custody of the admiralty, the application must necessarily be made to that court by any person setting up an interest in it. This application by petition is frequently entertained for proceeds in the registry, in cases where a suit in the admiralty would be wholly inadmissible.' Admiralty Rule 42 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723); compare The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 582, 583; The J. E. Rumbell, \n148 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 13 S. Ct. 498. The practice prevails in appellate courts as well as in courts of original jurisdiction. Compare In re Antigo Screen Door Co ., (C.C.A.) 123 F. 249, 251, 252.\n Sixth. Finally, Rizzo contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction because the order appealed from does no more than carry out another order not here for review. This is not true. The United States seeks to enforce against property in the possession of the Circuit Court of Appeals a right which had not theretofore been litigated, and which was not barred by earlier proceedings. If the government had been a stranger to the litigat on, it would have been entitled to intervene; compare Savannah v. Jesup, \n106 \nU.S. 563, 564\n, 565 S., 1 S.Ct. 512; Krippendorf v. Hyde, \n110 \nU.S. 276, 282\n, 283 S., 4 S.Ct. 27; Gumbel v. Pitkin, \n113 \nU.S. 545, 547\n, 548 S., 5 S.Ct. 616; Id., \n124 \nU.S. 131\n, 8 S.Ct. 379; and a denial of intervention would have been reviewable as a final judgment; compare Central Trust Co. v. Grant Locomotive Works, \n135 \nU.S. 207, 224\n, 225 S., 10 S.Ct. 736; Credits Commutation Co. v. United States, \n177 \nU.S. 311, 315\n, 316 S., 20 S.Ct. 636; Clark v. Williard, \n292 U.S. 112\n, 117-119, 54 S.Ct. 615. Its right to have the new issue adjudicated is not to be denied because it was already a party to the suit. Compare In re Howard, 9 Wall. 175, 183. The cases which hold that merely administrative proceedings under a decree may not be brought here for review have no application. See Wynkoop, etc., Co. v. Gaines, \n227 \nU.S. 4\n, 33 S.Ct. 214. Compare Collins \n\n[297 U.S. 530, 537]\n\u00a0\n v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 371 S., 40 S.Ct. 347; In re Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., Petitioner, \n129 \nU.S. 206\n, 9 S.Ct. 265.\n The order is reversed, with direction to the Circuit Court of Appeals to pay to the United States the proceeds of the sale now in the registry after deducting the usual court charges.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rizzo had filed with the clerk notices of assignment of the proceeds in amounts aggregating nearly the whole of the deposit. \n\n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

S.C.A.  2), and section 6 of the act, as amended April 1, 1896, 29 Stat. 85, 45 U.S.C.  6 (45 U.S.C.A.  6).1\n The complaint alleges that California, in the operation of the state- owned State Belt Railroad, is a common carrier engaged in interstate transportation by railroad, and that it has violated the Safety Appliance Act by hauling over the road a car equipped with defective coupling apparatus. Upon the trial, without a jury, upon stipulated facts, the District Court gave judgment for the United States. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, 75 F.(2d) 41, on the ground that as exclusive jurisdiction of suits to which a state is a party is conferred upon this Court by section 233 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1156, 28 U.S. C.  341 (28 U.S.C.A.  341), the District Court was without \n\n[297 U.S. 175, 181]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of the cause. We granted certiorari, \n296 \nU.S. 554\n, 56 S.Ct. 87, to review the case as one involving questions of public importance, upon a petition of the government which urged that the state is a common carrier by railroad, subject to the Safety Appliance Act, and, under its provisions, to suit in the District Court to recover penalties for violation of the act.\n In an earlier suit, Sherman v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 25\n, 51 S.Ct. 41, brought against the Board of State Harbor Commissioners, which supervises operation of the State Belt Railroad, to recover penalties for violation of the act, this Court set aside the judgment of the District Court for the government because the state had not been made a party.\n\n 1. \nWhether a transportation agency is a common carrier depends not upon its corporate character or declared purposes, but upon what it does. United States v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, \n249 \nU.S. 296, 304\n, 39 S.Ct. 283, 6 A.L.R. 527. The State Belt Railroad is owned and operated by the state, see Sherman v. United States, supra. It parallels the water front of San Francisco harbor and extends onto some forty-five state-owned wharves. It serves directly about one hundred and seventy-five industrial plants, has track connection with one interstate railroad, and, by wharf connections with freight car ferries, links that and three other interstate rail carriers with freight yards in San Francisco leased to them by the state. It receives and transports from the one to the other, by its own engines, all freight cars, loaded and empty, and the freight they contain, offered to it by railroads, steamship companies, and industrial plants. The larger part of this traffic has its origin or destination in states other than California. For the transportation service, it makes a flat charge per car. It issues no bills of lading and is not a party to through rates. It moves the cars on instructions contained in 'switch lists' made out by the delivering or receiving carrier, which pays the charge and absorbs it in its rate. The \n\n[297 U.S. 175, 182]\n\u00a0\n charge on cars not delivered to or received from another carrier is paid by the industry concerned.\n The Belt Railroad is thus a terminal railroad for the industries and carriers with which it connects, and it serves as a link in the through transportation of interstate freight shipped to or from points in San Francisco over the connecting carriers. Its service is of a public character, for hire, and does not differ in any salient feature from that which this Court, in United States v. Brooklyn Eastern District Term nal, supra, \n249 \nU.S. 296, 304\n, 305 S., 39 S.Ct. 283, 6 A.L.R. 527, held to be common carriage by rail in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Federal Hours of Service Act, 34 Stat. 1415, 45 U.S.C.  61 ( 45 U.S.C.A.  61).\n The state insists that the facts that it maintains no freight station, issues no bills of lading, and is engaged only in moving cars for a flat rate instead of at a charge per hundred pounds of freight moved, distinguish the operation of its railroad from that of the Brooklyn Terminal. As the service involves transportation of the cars and their contents, the method of fixing the charge is unimportant. Belt Railway Co. of Chicago v. United States (C.C.A.) 168 F. 542, 544, 22 L.R.A.(N.S.) 582; see United States v. Union Stock Yard & Transit Co., \n226 \nU.S. 286, 299\n, 300 S., 33 S.Ct. 83. And while maintenance of a freight station and the issue of bills of lading may be embraced in the service of a common carrier, and a part of interstate commerce, see United States v. Ferger, \n250 \nU.S. 199\n, 39 S.Ct. 445, Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 193\n, 55 S.Ct. 748, they are not indispensable adjuncts to either where the subject of transportation, here cars loaded and empty, may be effected without.\n All the essential elements of interstate rail transportation are present in the service rendered by the State Belt Railroad. They are the receipt and transportation, for the public, for hire, of cars moving in interstate commerce. See United States v. Union Stock Yard & Transit Co., \n226 U.S. 286\n, supra, 299, 33 S.Ct. 83; Union Stockyards Co. v. United \n\n[297 U.S. 175, 183]\n\u00a0\n States (C.C.A.) 169 F. 404; Belt Railway Co. of Chicago v. United States, supra. Its service, involving as it does the transportation of all carload freight moving in interstate commerce between the industries concerned and all railroad and steamship lines reaching the port, is of the same character, though wider in scope, as that held to be common carriage by rail in interstate commerce in the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal and the Union Stockyards Co. Cases. They abundantly support the conclusion that such is the service rendered by the state in the present case, a conclusion twice reached by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, see McCallum v. United States, 298 F. 373; Tilden v. United States, 21 F.( 2d) 967.\n\n 2. \nThe state urges that it is not subject to the Federal Safety Appliance Act. It is not denied that the omission charged would be a violation if by a privately-owned rail carrier in interstate commerce. But it is said that as the state is operating the railroad without profit, for the purpose of facilitating the commerce of the port, and is using the net proceeds of operation for harbor improvement, see Sherman v. United States, supra, Denning v. State, 123 Cal. 316, 55 P. 1000, it is engaged in performing a public function in its sovereign capacity and for that reason cannot constitutionally be subjected to the provisions of the federal act. In any case it is argued that the statute is not to be construed as applying to the state acting in that capacity.\n Despite reliance upon the point both by the government and the state, we think it unimportant to say whether the state conducts its railroad in its 'sovereign' or in its 'private' capacity. That in operating its railroad it is acting within a power reserved to the states cannot be doubted. See Puget Sound Power & Light Co. v. City of Seattle, \n291 \nU.S. 619, 624\n, 54 S.Ct. 542; Green v. Frazier, \n253 \nU.S. 233\n, 40 S.Ct. 499; Jones v. Portland, \n245 \nU.S. 217\n, 38 S.Ct. 112, L.R.A.1918C, 765, Ann.Cas. 1918E, 660. The only question we need consider is whether the exercise of that power, in \n\n[297 U.S. 175, 184]\n\u00a0\n whatever capacity, must be in subordination to the power to regulate interstate commerce, which has been granted specifically to the national government. The sovereign power of the states is necessarily dimin shed to the extent of the grants of power to the federal government in the Constitution. The power of a state to fix intrastate railroad rates must yield to the power of the national government when their regulation is appropriate to the regulation of interstate commerce. United States v. Louisiana, \n290 \nU.S. 70, 74\n, 75 S., 54 S.Ct. 28; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086; Houston, E. & W.T. Ry. Co. v. United States (Shreveport Rate Cases), \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833. A contract between a state and a rail carrier fixing intrastate rates is subject to regulation and control by Congress, acting within the commerce clause, Const.U.S. art. 1,  8, cl. 3; New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591\n, 42 S.Ct. 239, as are state agencies created to effect a public purpose, see Sanitary District of Chicago v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 405\n, 45 S.Ct. 176; Board of Trustees v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 48\n, 53 S.Ct. 509; see Georgia v. Chattanooga, \n264 \nU.S. 472\n, 44 S.Ct. 369. In each case the power of the state is subordinate to the constitutional exercise of the granted federal power.\n The analogy of the constitutional immunity of state instrumentalities from federal taxation, on which respondent relies, is not illuminating. That immunity is implied from the nature of our federal system and the relationship within it of state and national governments, and is equally a restriction on taxation by either of the instrumentalities of the other. Its nature requires that it be so construed as to allow to each government reasonable scope for its taxing power, see Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 U.S. 514\n, 522-524, 46 S.Ct. 172, which would be unduly curtailed if either by extending its activities could withdraw from the taxing power of the other subjects of taxation traditionally within it. Helvering v. Powers, \n293 \nU.S. 214, 225\n, 55 S.Ct. 171; Ohio v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 360\n, 54 S.Ct. 725; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437\n, 26 S.Ct. 110, 4 Ann.Cas. 737; see Murray v. Wilson \n\n[297 U.S. 175, 185]\n\u00a0\n Distilling Co., \n213 \nU.S. 151, 173\n, 29 S.Ct. 458, explaining South Carolina v. United States, supra. Hence we look to the activities in which the states have traditionally engaged as marking the boundary of the restriction upon the federal taxing power. But there is no such limitation upon the plenary power to regulate commerce. The state can no more deny the power if its exercise has been authorized by Congress than can an individual.\n California, by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has subjected itself to the commerce power, and is liable for a violation of the Safety Appliance Act, as are other carriers, unless the statute is to be deemed inapplicable to state-owned railroads because it does not specifically mention them. The Federal Safety Appliance Act is remedial, to protect employees and the public from injury because of defective railway appliances, Swinson v. Chicago, St. Paul, M. & O. Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 529\n, 55 S.Ct. 517, 96 A.L.R. 1136, Fairport, P. & E.R. Co. v. Meredith, \n292 \nU.S. 589, 594\n, 54 S.Ct. 826, Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., \n196 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 25 S.Ct. 158, and to safeguard interstate commerce itself from obstruction and injury due to defective appliances upon locomotives and cars used on the highways of interstate commerce, even though their individual use is wholly intrastate. Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20\n, 32 S.Ct. 2; Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., \n291 \nU.S. 205, 214\n, 54 S.Ct. 402. The danger to be apprehended is as great and commerce may be equally impeded whether the defective appliance is used on a railroad which is state-owned or privately-owned. No convincing reason is advanced why interstate commerce and persons and property concerned in it should not receiv the protection of the act whenever a state, as well as a privately-owned carrier, brings itself within the sweep of the statute, or why its all-embracing language should not be deemed to afford that protection.\n In Ohio v. Helvering, supra, it was held that a state, upon engaging in the business, became subject to a federal \n\n[297 U.S. 175, 186]\n\u00a0\n statute imposing a tax on those dealing in intoxicating liquors, although states were not specifically mentioned in the statute. The same conclusion was reached in South Carolina v. United States, supra; and see Helvering v. Powers, supra. Similarly the Interstate Commerce Commission has regarded this and other state-owned interstate rail carriers as subject to its jurisdiction, although the Interstate Commerce Act does not in terms apply to state-owned rail carriers. See California Canneries Co. v. Southern P. Co., 51 I.C.C. 500, 502, 503; United States v. Belt Line R. Co., 56 I.C.C. 121; Texas State Railroad, 34 I.C.C., Val.R., 276.\n Respondent invokes the canon of construction that a sovereign is presumptively not intended to be bound by its own statute unless named in it, see Guarantee Title & Trust Co. v. Title Guaranty & Surety Co., \n224 \nU.S. 152\n, 32 S.Ct. 457; United States v. Herron, 20 Wall. 251; In re Fowble (D.C.) 213 F. 676. This rule has its historical basis in the English doctrine that the Crown is unaffected by acts of Parliament not specifically directed against it. United States v. Herron, supra, 20 Wall. 251, 255; Dollar Savings Bank v. United States, 19 Wall. 227, 239. The presumption is an aid to consistent construction of statutes of the enacting sovereign when their purpose is in doubt, but it does not require that the aim of a statute fairly to be inferred be disregarded because not explicitly stated. See Baltimore National Bank v. State Tax Commission of Maryland, \n297 \nU.S. 209\n, 56 S.Ct. 417, decided this day. We can perceive no reason for extending it so as to exempt a business carried on by a state from the otherwise applicable provisions of an act of Congress, all-embracing in scope and national in its purpose, which is as capable of being obstructed by state as by individual action. Language and objectives so plain are not to be thwarted by resort to a rule of construction whose purpose is but to resolve doubts, and whose application in the circumstances would be hightly \n\n[297 U.S. 175, 187]\n\u00a0\n artificial. It was disregarded in Ohio v. Helvering, supra, and South Carolina v. United States, supra. See Heiner v. Colonial Trust Co., \n275 \nU.S. 232, 234\n, 235 S., 48 S.Ct. 65.\n\n 3. \nThe jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain suits by the United States against a state under the Safety Appliance Act turns on the construction to be given to section 6 of the act in the light of section 233 of the Judicial Code. Article 3, section 2, of the Constitution extends the judicial power of the United States and the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to cases 'in which a State shall be a Party.' See United States v. West Virginia, \n295 \nU.S. 463, 470\n, 55 S.Ct. 789, and cases cited. But Congress may confer on inferior courts concurrent original jurisdiction of such suits. Ames v. Kansas, \n111 \nU.S. 449\n, 4 S.Ct. 437; United States v. Louisiana, \n123 \nU.S. 32\n, 8 S.Ct. 17; compare Bors v. Preston, \n111 \nU.S. 252\n, 4 S.Ct. 407. Section 233 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. 341 (28 U.S. C.A.  341), originally enacted as section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 80, became section 687 of the Revised Statutes, and was carried into the Judicial Code in 1911, 36 Stat. 1156. It gives to this Court 'exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies of a civil nature where a State is a party, except between a State and its citizens, or between a State and citizens of other States, or aliens.' The later enacted section 6 of the Safety Appliance Act, see Smiley v. Holm, \n285 \nU.S. 355\n, 52 S.Ct. 397, provides that the penalty hich it imposes is 'to be recovered in a suit or suits to be brought ... in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction in the locality where such violation shall have been committed.'\n If it be assumed that the present suit to recover the payment denominated a 'penalty' by section 6 is a controversy of a civil nature, but see Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265\n, 8 S.Ct. 1370, cf. Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268\n, 56 S.Ct. 229, it is by section 233 of the Judicial Code within the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court, unless that provision is supplanted with respect \n\n[297 U.S. 175, 188]\n\u00a0\n to suits such as the present by the provisions of section 6. Upon that assumption section 6 is in conflict with section 233 of the Judicial Code and supersedes it, United States v. Yuginovich, \n256 \nU.S. 450, 463\n, 41 S.Ct. 551, United States ex rel. Chandler v. Dodge County Commissioners, \n110 \nU.S. 156\n, 3 S.Ct. 591, United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 92, unless, again, the general language of section 6 is to be taken as not applying to suits brought against a state. Since the section which, as we have held, imposes the liability upon state and privately-owned carriers alike, also provides the remedy and designates the manner and the court in which the remedy is to be pursued, we think the jurisdictional provisions are as applicable to suits brought to enforce the liability of states as to those against privately- owned carriers, and that the District Court had jurisdiction.\n If we lay aside possible doubts, whether the suit is of a 'civil nature,' in which case only does section 233 of the Judicial Code purport to make the jurisdiction of this Court exclusive, still, in construing the jurisdictional provisions of section 6 of the Safety Appliance Act practical convenience and 'the tacit assumptions' upon which it is reasonable to suppose its language was used, see Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, \n280 \nU.S. 379, 383\n, 50 S.Ct. 154, are not to be disregarded. The controversy in a suit authorized by section 6 is essentially local in character and involves issues for which a jury trial may be appropriate, compare Georgia v. Brailsford, 3 Dall. 1. Their adjudication often requires the presence, as witnesses, of railroad workers, shippers, and others of the locality. These are considerations which undoubtedly led to the command that the suit should be brought in the district court of the 'locality' where violations occur. They are considerations as applicable to suits against a state as to suits against a privately-owned railroad. The suggestion that it should be assumed that Congress did not intend to subject a sovereign state to the inconvenience and loss of dignity in- \n\n[297 U.S. 175, 189]\n\u00a0\n volved in a trial in a District Court is not persuasive when weighed against the complete appropriateness of the court and venue selected for the trial of issues growing out of the particular activity in which the state has chosen to engage.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] ' 2. It shall be unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car used in moving interstate traffic not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.'\n's 6. Any commo carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad using any locomotive engine, running any train, or hauling or permitting to be hauled or used on its line any car in violation of any of the preceding provisions of this chapter, shall be liable to a penalty of $100 for each and every such violation, to be recovered in a suit or suits to be brought by the United States district attorney in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction in the locality where such violation shall have been committed; and it shall be the duty of such district attorney to bring such suits upon duly verified information being lodged with him of such violation having occurred.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Paragraph 22 provides that the 'authority of the commission' conferred by paragraph 18 shall not extend to the 'abandonment of spur, industrial, team, switching, or side tracks, located ... wholly within one State.' Transportation Act 1920, c. 91,  402, 41 Stat. 456, 477, 478 ( 49 U.S.C.A.  1(18, 22). Compare Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S.Ct. 263; Alabama & Vicksburg Ry. Co. v. Jackson & Eastern Ry. Co., \n271 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S.Ct. 535; Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. Northside Belt Ry. Co., \n276 \nU.S. 475\n, 48 S.Ct. 361.\n The Oregon Short Line Railroad, an interstate carrier, owns 9 miles of track, in Teton County, Idaho, known as the Talbot branch, and extending to a coal mine at Talbot. It applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for authority to abandon that trackage. The state intervened through its Attorney General and Public Utilities Commission. They objected, among other things, on the ground that the Interstate Commerce Commission was without jurisdiction, since the so-called Talbot branch was n fact a 'spur' or 'industrial track' located wholly within the state. The objection was overruled; and authority to abandon the trackage was granted by division 4. Oregon Short Line Railroad Company Abandonment, 193 I.C.C. 697.\n The state and its Public Utilities Commission then brought this suit in the federal court for Utah against the \n\n[298 U.S. 105, 108]\n\u00a0\n United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Oregon Short Line, a Utah corporation, praying that the order authorizing abandonment be set aside, and other relief. The case was heard before three judges. The sole controversy was whether the trackage was a 'spur' or 'industrial track'; and, therefore, excluded from the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The record made before the Commission was introduced in evidence; also some testimony 'which merely amplified evidence already in the record.' The court found, among other things:\n\n\n (1)\n The trackage was constructed during the period of federal control by the United States Railroad Administration, pursuant to a contract with the owners of coal mines situated at Talbot, for the single purpose of serving them. The owners agreed to furnish the right of way and to pay part of the cost of construction; and they agreed also that the railroad might tear up the tracks on their failure to supply for transportation a minimum specified tonnage. For a period of four years after construction no rail transportation was maintained, because of litigation involving the mines.\n\n\n (2)\n In 1924, on application of the coal company, the Public Utilities Commission of Idaho, over objection of the Oregon Short Line that it lacked jurisdiction, held that the line was a spur track. It ordered the railroad to repair and operate it upon receiving from the coal company a bond conditioned upon the company delivering a specified minimum coal tonnage each year for five years. The railroad complied with the order. Subsequently, it procured a judgment on the bond for breach of the condition.\n\n\n (3)\n The Oregon Short Line has never maintained a train schedule or regular service over this trackage; has never furnished express, passenger, or mail service; has maintained no buildings, loading platforms, or agent at \n\n[298 U.S. 105, 109]\n\u00a0\n any point along the trackage; and has had no telegraph or telephone line in connection therewith. Bills of lading for cars of coal are made out by the mine company. There are practically no shipments in the opposite direction; the few supplies for the mine being sent up in the empty coal cars when ordered.\n The District Court concluded that the Talbot branch was constructed and has been maintained for the purpose of serving a single industry; that practically no other industry is served; that this trackage does not invade new territory; that its continued operation or abandonment is of local and not of national concern; that it is therefore a 'spur'; and hence, that the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission was in excess of its jurisdiction. The court annulled the order and enjoined its enforcement. 10 F.Supp. 712.\n The decree should be affirmed, because on findings amply supported by the evidence the trackage is a spur. Appellants object that, since the findings and order of the Interstate Commerce Commission were made on substantial evidence, they are conclusive, and that it was error to admit the testimony first offered in the District Court. Compare Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420, 444\n, 50 S.Ct. 220. Although it would have been better practice to have introduced all relevant evidence before the Commission, as appellee's counsel concede, the court did not err in admitting the additional testimony. For whether certain trackage is a 'spur' is a mixed question of fact and law left by Congress to the decision of a court; not to the final determination of either the federal or a state commission.\n This suit is not one brought to set aside for error or irregularity an order of the Commission on a matter within its juri diction. In such a proceeding the United States is the only party named as defendant; others interested become parties by intervention. See Commerce \n\n[298 U.S. 105, 110]\n\u00a0\n Court Act, June 18, 1910, c. 309,  3, 36 Stat. 539, 542 (now Jud.Code  208, 28 U.S.C.A.  46), Urgent Deficiencies Act, October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219. Here, the jurisdiction of that Commission was challenged. It and the Oregon Short Line were joined as defendants in the original bill. Paragraph 20 of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended (49 U.S.C.A.  1(20) authorizes any party in interest to apply to 'any court of competent jurisdiction' to enjoin an unauthorized abandonment; and if, on such application, Talbot branch should be held to be a spur, it could not be abandoned legally without the consent of the Public Utilities Commission of Idaho. It is only because the plaintiffs sought also to have the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission annulled (compare Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n270 U.S. 266\n, 271-274, 46 S.Ct. 263), that the case was one for three judges and could be brought here by direct appeal under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (28 U.S.C.A.  47).\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Miller, both of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n[299 U.S. 123, 130]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question of the constitutional validity of the Act of Congress of August 22, 1935, c. 605, 49 Stat. 682, prescribing qualifications for service as jurors in the District of Columbia, as applied to criminal prosecutions.\n The respondent was convicted of petit larceny in the Police Court of the District and was sentenced to imprisonment for 240 days. The larceny was from a private \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 131]\n\u00a0\n corporation. On his trial twelve prospective jurors were called. Their examination showed that one was the holder of a 'bonus certificate'; others were employed as clerks in governmental departments, one in the United States Weather Bureau, another in the Federal Emergency Administration, a third in the Treasury Department, and a fourth in the Navy Yard. Another prospective juror was a housewife who received a Civil War pension. Each of these persons was challenged for cause upon the ground of interest in the United States government. The challenge was disallowed. Counsel for defendant then exhausted his three peremptory challenges and when the jury was finally selected there remained as jurors, despite a reiterated challenge for cause, the recipient of the Civil War pension and the two clerks employed in the Treasury Department and the Navy Yard respectively.\n The action of the trial court was taken under the Act of August 22, 1935, which provides that persons of this description shall be eligible for jury service. \n1\n On appeal, \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 132]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Appeals (65 App.D.C. 330, 83 F.(2d) 587, 589) thus stated the occasion for the statute, its purport, and the question it raises:\n'Prior to the passage of this statute, the provision with relation to the qualifications of a juror was that he should be a citizen of the United States, a resident of the District of Columbia, over 21 and under 65 years of age, able to read and write and understand the English language, and a person who had never been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. In 1908, the Supreme Court held in Crawford v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 183\n, 29 S.Ct. 260, 264, 15 Ann.Cas. 392, that an employee of the United \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 133]\n\u00a0\n States was not qualified to serve as a member of a petit jury in the District of Columbia in the trial of a criminal case. The effect of the decision and of others of like nature which followed, resulted, it is said, in narrowing the eligible list of jurors in the District to the point where it sometimes became difficult to secure jurors possessing the necessary qualifications. To correct this, Congress extended the list of eligibles to include employees of the United States and of the District of Columbia, officers and enlisted men of the National Guard and of the Military, Naval, Marine, and Coast Guard Reserve Corps, notaries public, postmasters, and recipients of pensions and gratuities from the United States or the District, as well as those having contracts with the United States or the District; and the question we have to decide is whether this statute, when applied in a criminal case like the present, is in violation of the provisions of the Sixth Amendment guaranteeing to the accused in all criminal prosecutions the right of trial by an impartial jury.'\n\n Dealing particularly with the qualification of governmental employees, the court answered this question in the affirmative and reversed the judgment of conviction. 65 App.D.C. 330, 83 F.(2d) 587. Because of the importance of the question, we granted certiorari. \n298 \nU.S. 652\n, 56 S.Ct. 947\n\n\n First. The Sixth Amendment requires that 'in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury.' The Amendment prescribes no specific tests. The bias of a prospective juror may be actual or implied; that is, it may be bias in fact or bias conclusively presumed as matter of law. There is no ground for a contention-and we do not find that such a contention is made-that Congress has undertaken to preclude the ascertainment of actual bias. All persons otherwise qualified for jury service are subject to examination as to actual bias. All the resources of appropriate judicial inquiry remain avail- \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 134]\n\u00a0\n able in this instance as in others to ascertain whether a prospective juror, although not exempted from service, has any bias in fact which would prevent his serving as an impartial juror. In dealing with an employee of the government, the court would properly by solicitous to discover whether in view of the nature or circumstances of his employment, or of the relation of the particular governmental activity to the matters involved in the prosecution, or otherwise, he had actual bias, and, if he had, to disqualify him. No bias of that sort is shown in the instant case.\n The question here is as to implied bias, a bias attributable in law to the prospective juror regardless of actual partiality. The contention of the defendant is that there must be read into the constitutional requirement an absolute disqualification in criminal cases of a person employed by the government, a disqualification which Congress is powerless to remove or modify. This contention gives rise to two inquiries-(1) Whether, in the practice in England prior to the adoption of the Amendment, or in the colonies, there was an absolute disqualification of governmental employees to serve on juries in criminal cases, and (2) whether, either because of that practice, or in reason, such a disqualification should be regarded as essential to the impartiality of the jury and hence beyond the reach of the legislative power. The government insists that both questions should be answered in the negative.\n Second. The government has presented the result of elaborate research to show that throughout the long period from the development of the jury system to modern times, the English common law permitted a servant of the King to serve as a juror in crown cases, provided he had no actual bias.\n Challenges at common law were to the array, that is, with respect to the constitution of the panel, or to the \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 135]\n\u00a0\n polls, for disqualification of a juror. Challenges to the polls were either 'principal' or 'to the favor,' the former being upon grounds of absolute disqualification, the latter for actual bias. The government quotes the statements of early commentators from Fitzherbert to Hargrave, indicating that a principal challenge was not allowed in crown cases upon the ground that the prospective juror was a servant of the crown, and that a challenge for that reason, if permitted at all, was to the favor. \n2\n The government reviews the early cases in support of this conclusion. \n3\n It is not necessary to set forth these authorities in detail as there seems to be no controversy as to their purport. We give in the margin the analysis presented by respondent's counsel. \n4\n Their re sume is as follows: \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 136]\n\u00a0\n 'From the above it seems that nineteen authorities hold that there is no principal cause of challenge against a Crown Servant; that twelve authorities hold that there is not even any challenge for favor. Fitzherbert, Coke, and Rex v. Hampden, 9 St.Tr. 1054, 1057, 1061, allow challenges for favor in respect of menial servants. Actual malice as distinguished from favor was allowed as a challenge by: Staunforde, Lord Hale, Duncombe, Hawkins, Matthew Bacon, Year Book 19 Ass. 62 Pl. 639, Rex v. Genney, Keilw. 102a, Reg. v. Blakeman, 175 Eng.Rpt. 479. Brooke allowed no challenge of any kind for the defendant but challenge of either kind for the king's side.'\n Respondent's counsel quote from the commentators their statements of the reason why a crown servant was\n___ Challenge Challenge \"The Cases: In Principal To Favor \"Year Book (1346) 19 Ass. 62, pl. 6 No No \"Year Book, 4 Henry VII 8, P. pl. 7 No No \"Year Book, 4 Henry VII, 3 H. pl. 5 No No \"Rex v.

And such a disqualification cannot, upon the ground of such a practice, be treated as embedded in the Sixth Amendment. See Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 549\n, 8 S.Ct. 1301; Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343, 350\n, 18 S.Ct. 620; Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 254, 70 A.L.R. 263; Dimick v. Schiedt, \n293 \nU.S. 474, 476\n, 487 S., 55 S.Ct. 296, 301, 95 A. L.R. 1150; Continental Illinois Bank & Trust Co. v. Rock Island Railway, \n294 \nU.S. 648, 669\n, 55 S.ct. 595, 603; 2 Story on the Constitution,  1791.\n We turn to the question whether in the colonies, or in the states at the time of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment, there was such a disqualification. We find no satisfactory evidence to that effect. Counsel for the government say that the practice in the colonies prior to the adoption, of the Federal Constitution 'apparently cannot be ascertained.' They say that they have searched 'the available reports and authorities without finding anything of relevance.' The researches of respondent's counsel \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 138]\n\u00a0\n have not supplied the lack. They urge that, to make the exception applicable, the government must affirmatively show that the colonists recognized the exception in favor of the King's servants at the time the Sixth Amendment was formulated. But before we can read an absolute disqualification into the Amendment because of a rule obtaining in the colonies different from that obtaining in England, we must have proof that there was a different rule. Respondent's contention is based upon a supposed acceptance of Blackstone's statement of the grounds of a principal challenge:\n'A principal challenge is such, where the cause assigned carries with it prima facie evident marks of suspicion, either of malice or favour; as, that a juror is of kin to either party within the ninth degree; that he has been arbitrator on either side; that he has an interest in the cause; that there is an action depending between him and the party; that he has taken money for his verdict; that he has formerly been a juror in the same cause; that he is the party's master, servant, counsellor, steward, or attorney, or of the same society or corporation with him: all these are principal causes of challenge; which, if true, cannot be overruled, for jurors must be omni exceptione majores.' 3 Bl.Com. 363.\n\n Undoubtedly, as we have frequently said, the framers of the Constitution were familiar with Blackstone's Commentaries. Many copies of the work had been sold here and it was generally regarded as the most satisfactory exposition of the common law of England. Schick v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 65, 66\n, 69 S., 24 S.Ct. 826, 1 Ann.Cas. 585. But in this instance we think the point is pressed too far. It will be observed that Blackstone does not refer specifically to the subject now under discussion. His statement has relation to masters and servants of private parties. And, while at another place he makes the general statement that challenges in criminal cases may be made 'for the very same \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 139]\n\u00a0\n reasons that they may be made in civil causes' (4 Bl.Com. 352), he makes no mention in either instance of the practice in crown cases with respect to servants of the crown. Blackstone's failure to refer to that historic exception is obviously not enough to refute the proof of its existence as shown by the affirmative statements of other commentators and the decided cases. We think that his omission to mention the case of crown servants cannot be regarded as a sufficient basis for holding, in the absence of other evidence, that the common-law rule was different in the colonies from that in England, much less that the Congress which proposed the Sixth Amendment, or the state Legislatures which ratified it, undertook to establish an absolute disqualification of all governmental employees beyond the control of the congressional power.\n Respondent relies upon our decision in Crawford v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 183\n, 29 S.Ct. 260, 15 Ann.Cas. 392. That was a prosecution in the District of Columbia for conspiracy to defraud the United States in relation to a contract with the Post Office Department. One of the grounds of reversal of the judgment of conviction was the overruling by the trial court of a challenge to a juror who was a clerk in charge of a subpostal station located in a drug store. The Court referred to the qualifications for jurors prescribed by section 215 of the Code of Laws for the District (D.C.Code 1929, T. 18,  357) and to the provision of section 217 (see D.C.Code 1929, T. 18,  360) exempting from jury duty 'salaried officers of the Government.' Assuming the contention to be sound that the mere fact that a proposed juror was such a salaried officer could be ground only for his own claim of exemption, the Court expressed the opinion that the provisions of the sections of the Code did not embrace the entire subject of the qualifications of jurors; that by the common law there was a further qualification; and that under that law in force in Maryland, and applicable to the District, the court should have held the juror disqualified by reason of his employment. Id., \n212 U.S. 183\n, at pages 195, 196, 29 S.Ct. 260, 15 Ann.Cas. 392. \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 140]\n\u00a0\n It will be observed that the employment was in the very department to the affairs of which the alleged conspiracy related. But the decision took a broader range and did not rest upon that possible distinction. The Court was not aided by a careful or comprehensive presentation of the English precedents and it was not shown that the courts of Maryland had passed upon the point. The above-mentioned statement of Blackstone was cited for the proposition 'that one is not a competent juror in a case if he is master, servant, steward, counsellor or attorney of either party.' The Court also cited the decision in Block v. State, 100 Ind. 357, 362, which was said to follow that rule of the common law. In that case the juror was a deputy of the prosecuting attorney. The latter, as the state court said, 'was, by analogy and for all practical purposes, the plaintiff in the prosecution' and the deputy 'had become and was the employee and subordinate of the prosecuting attorney' and therefore 'impliedly biased' ( Id., 100 Ind. 357, at page 364).8 In the Crawford Case this Court also referred to the decisions cited in the dissenting opinion in the court below (30 App.D.C. 1, at page 33) to the effect that 'a clerk or employee of a private party or of a corporation is not qualified to sit as a juror,' and it was said that while the cases cited were civil cases, the rule applied to criminal cases as well. \n9\n The rule \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 141]\n\u00a0\n which had obtained in England with respect to the qualifications of servants of the crown to serve as jurors in crown cases was not mentioned and the authorities to which we have referred in that relation were not brought to the attention of the Court.\n In the light of the English precedents, and in the absence of any satisfactory showing of a different practice in the colonies, we are unable to accept the ruling in the Crawford Case as determinative here or to reach the conclusion that it was a settled rule of the common law prior to the adoption of the Sixth Amendment that the mere fact of a governmental employment, unrelated to the particular issues or circumstances of a criminal prosecution, created an absolute disqualification to serve as a juror in a criminal case.\n Third. Even if it could be said that at common law such a disqualification existed, we are of the opinion that Congress had power to remove it. That point was not touched in the Crawford case. Indeed it was said, referring to the Code of Laws of the District of Columbia, that if the provision of section 215, together with section 217, 'were alone to be considered, it might be that the juror was qualified.' And, further, in referring to Block v. State, supra, the ruling there was summarized as being to the effect 'that the Indiana statute upon the qualifications of jurors did not strike out the rule of the common law on the subject, when not inconsistent with the statute.' \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 142]\n\u00a0\n The observations of the Court in the Crawford Case, in the absence of such an act of Congress as that now under consideration, should not be taken as attempting to set up an absolute rule to be applied in the face of specific legislation. The question of legislative power was neither presented nor passed upon.\n Whether a clause in the Constitution is to be restricted by a rule of the common law as it existed when the Constitution was adopted depends upon the terms or nature of the particular clause. Continental Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v, Rock Island Railway, supra. We have frequently adverted to the firm place which the jury as a fact-finding body holds in our history and jurisprudence. Dimick v. Schiedt, supra, \n293 U.S. 474\n, at pages 485, 486, 55 S.Ct. 296, 300, 95 A.L.R. 1150. The Constitution would have been 'justly obnoxious to the most conclusive objection' if the right of trial by jury, as the bulwark of civil and political liberties, had not been recognized and confirmed 'in the most solemn terms.' Id.; 2 Story on the Constitution,  1779. And the importance of safeguarding the complete integrity of the jury in the full sense of the Constitution is not to be gainsaid.\n We have described the essential elements of 'trial by jury.' In Patton v. United States, supra, we said that these elements as recognized in this country and England when the Constitution was adopted were '(1) the jury should consist of twelve men, neither more nor less; (2) that the trial should be in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge having power to instruct them as to the law and advise them in respect of the facts; and (3) that the verdict should be unanimous.' None of these elements is involved here.\n The Sixth Amendment was not needed to require trial by jury in cases of crimes. That requirement is provided by article 3,  2, cl. 3. The Sixth Amendment provided further assurances. It added that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right 'to a \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 143]\n\u00a0\n speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining Witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.' These requirements as to speed, publicity, impartiality, information as to the charge, confrontation with witnesses, compulsory process, and assistance of counsel are all of first importance. But it would hardly be contended that in all these matters regard must be had to the particular forms and procedure used at common law. These requirements relate to matters of substance and not of form. And the true purpose of the Amendment can be achieved only by applying them in that sense.\n In construing the Seventh Amendment providing for the preservation of trial by jury in suits at common law, and that no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined 'than according to the rules of the common law,' we have said that the aim of the Amendment was 'to preserve the substance of the common-law right of trial by jury, as distinguished from mere matters of form or procedure.' Baltimore & Carolina Line v. Redman, \n295 \nU.S. 654, 657\n, 55 S.Ct. 890, 891. See, also, Walker v. New Mexico & Southern Pacific R. Co., \n165 \nU.S. 593, 596\n, 17 S.Ct. 421; Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., \n283 \nU.S. 494, 498\n, 51 S.Ct. 513, 514. We held in Re Peterson, \n253 \nU.S. 300\n, 40 S.Ct. 543, that there was no constitutional obstacle to the appointment by a federal court of an auditor in aid of jury trials although the practice in question had not obtained prior to the adoption of the Constitution either in England or in the colonies in connection with trial by jury. The ruling rested upon the fundamental consideration that 'New devices may be used to adapt the ancient institution to present needs and to make of it an efficient instrument \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 144]\n\u00a0\n in the administration of justice. Indeed, such changes are essential to the preservation of the right.' Id., \n253 U.S. 300\n, at pages 309, 310, 40 S. Ct. 543, 546.\n This principle of construction has also had notable application to the requirement of trial by jury in criminal prosecutions. In the recent case of Funk v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 371, 372\n, 54 S.Ct. 212, 216, 93 A.L.R. 1136, this Court, without the aid of legislative enactment, held that the wife of the defendant on trial for a criminal offence in a federal court was a competent witness in his behalf. The Court overruled cases to the contrary, sustaining the power of the federal courts 'to declare and effectuate, upon common-law principles, what is the present rule upon a given subject in the light of fundamentally altered conditions, without regard to what has previously been declared and practiced.' It was deemed to be axiomatic 'that the common law is not immutable but flexible, and by its own principles adapts itself to varying conditions.' Id., \n290 U.S. 371\n, at page 383, 54 S.Ct. 212, 216, 93 A.L.R. 1136. And what courts can thus do to assure the appropriate growth and adaptation of the law a fortiori can be achieved by the action of a competent Legislature.\n In Patton v. United States, supra, the Court answered in the affirmative a question certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals (30 F.(2d) 1015) whether, in case a juror became incapacitated during a trial upon indictment, the defendant and the government could consent 'to the trial proceeding to a finality with 11 jurors' and the defendant could 'thus waive the right to a trial and verdict by a constitutional jury of 12 men.' The Court said that 'it may be conceded, at least generally, that under the rule of the common law the accused was not permitted to waive trial by jury.' But the Court did not think it necessary to consider that phase of the matter as 'the rule of the common law, whether exclusive or subject to exceptions, was justified by conditions which no longer exist.' Id., \n281 U.S. 276\n, at page 306, 50 S.Ct. 253, 261, 70 A.L.R. 263. And the Court found no convincing ground for holding that a waiver of a jury trial was not \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 145]\n\u00a0\n as effective in the case of felonies as in that of misdemeanors. Id., \n281 U.S. 276\n, at page 309, 50 S.Ct. 253, 262, 70 A.L.R. 263.\n The Sixth Amendment does not preclude legislation making women qualified to serve as jurors in criminal prosecutions although that was not permitted at common law. Tynan v. United States (C.C.A.) 297 F. 177, 178, 179; Hoxie v. United States (C.C.A.) 15 F.(2d) 762. Although aliens are within the protection of the Sixth Amendment, the ancient rule under which an alien might have a trial by jury de medietate linguae, 'one half denizens and the other aliens'-in order to insure impartiality-no longer obtains. \n10\n Congress has reduced the number of peremptory challenges of the accused. This number which was 'settled by the common law' at thirty-five and fixed by the statute 22 Hen. VIII, c. 14, at twenty (4 Bl.Com. 354) has been reduced in the case of felonies, other than treason or capital offences, to ten. 28 U.S.C.  424 (28 U.S.C.A.  424) Code D.C., tit. 6,  366. In Stilson v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 583, 586\n, 40 S.Ct. 28, 29, 30, we said on this point: 'There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which requires the Congress to grant peremptory challenges to defendants in criminal cases; trial by an impartial jury is all that is secured. The number of challenges is left to be regulated by the common law or the enactments of Congress.' And the same was held to be true of the authority of Congress to treat several defendants, for this purpose, as one party. It is not necessary to multiply illustrations of the familiar principle which while safeguarding the essence of the constitutional requirements permits readjustments of procedure consistent with their spirit and purpose.\n Impartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of this mental atti- \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 146]\n\u00a0\n tude of appropriate indifference, the Constitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is not chained to any ancient and artificial formula. State courts enforcing similar requirements of state constitutions as to trial by jury have held that legislatures enjoy a reasonable freedom in establishing qualifications for jury service, although these involve a departure from common law rules. This principle was thus stated by the Court of Appeals of New York in Stokes v. People, 53 N.Y. 164, 173, 13 Am. Rep. 492: 'While the Constitution secures the right of trial by an impartial jury, the mode of procuring and impaneling such jury is regulated by law, either common or statutory, principally the latter, and it is within the power of the legislature to make, from time to time, such changes in the law as it may deem expedient, taking care to preserve the right of trial by an impartial jury.' And in Brown v. State, 62 N.J. Law, 666, 678, 42 A. 811, 814, the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey enunciated the same doctrine: 'The provision in our constitution (article 1,  8) that the accused should have a right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury, secured to the accused a right to a trial by an impartial jury, by an express constitutional provision. The means by which an impartial jury should be obtained are not defined. In neither of the constitutional provisions on this subject is there any requirement with respect to challenges, or to the qualifications of jurors, or the mode in which the jury shall be selected. These subjects were left in the discretion of the legislature, with no restriction or limitation, except that the accused should have the right to be tried by an impartial jury.'\n One of the grounds of principal challenge at common law was that a juror was 'related to either party within the ninth degree, though it is only by marriage.' \n11\n It appears that this restriction has been reduced in a num- \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 147]\n\u00a0\n ber of states to degrees from the third to the sixth. \n12\n The common-law rule with respect to jurors who have formed an opinion upon the subject of the controversy has been liberalized by legislation which meets the essential condition of impartiality while taking account of modern conditions. \n13\n The disqualification of taxpayers in cases where a municipality is interested has been removed by statute in may states. \n14\n In Commonwealth v. Reed, 1 Gray (Mass.) 472, the court held that action of that sort was not a violation of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights ( Const. pt. 1, art. 29) securing to every citizen 'the right to be tried by judges as free, impartial and independent, as the lot of humanity will admit.' The court thought that an exemption 'from an interest which is only theoretic or imaginary, or which is so remote and trifling and insignificant, that it may fairly be supposed to be incapable of affecting the judgment or of influencing the conduct of an individual, is not essential.' And referring to the particular contention as to the interest of a taxpayer of a town in the penalties demanded, the court added: 'Such an interest as arises from that cause is remote and minute; and it may well devolve upon the legislature to determine if it ought to disable an otherwise impartial citizen from serving in the capacity of a juror. The rule established by such authority must, in general, be the guide by which courts of law will be controlled.'\n The ultimate question is not whether Congress has changed a common- law rule, but whether, in reason, an \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 148]\n\u00a0\n absolute disqualification of governmental employees to serve as jurors in criminal cases is essential to the impartiality of the jury. The government stresses the factual situation in the District of Columbia before the enactment of the statute before us. Respondent replies that a large proportion of governmental employees are in any event disqualified because of legal residence elsewhere. But after making every allowance for that class, it is still true that in the District of Columbia there is a numerous body of persons15 who, except for the fact of governmental employment, would be eligible for service as jurors and whose service, by reason of their intelligence and character, would be highly desirable. That fact is emphasized by the congressional committees which recommended the passage of the act. \n16\n They stated, after referring to the exemptions then existing: 'These exemptions take from those who would otherwise be qualified some of the best jurymen available and makes the empanneling of a jury much more difficult.' The bill was recommended by the bar association of the district, by the district commissioners and by the corporation counsel. \n17\n It is manifest that the act was passed to meet a public need and that no interference with the actual impartiality of the jury was contemplated. The enactment itself is tantamount to a legislative declaration that \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 149]\n\u00a0\n the prior disqualification was artificial and not necessary to secure impartiality.\n Why should it be assumed that a juror merely because of employment by the government, would be biased against the accused? In criminal prosecutions the government is acting simply as the instrument of the public in enforcing penal laws for the protection of society. In that enforcement all citizens are interested. It is difficult to see why a governmental employee, merely by virtue of his employment, is interested in that enforcement either more or less than any good citizen is or should be. The instant case is a good illustration. The accused was on trial for theft from a store of a private corporation. Can it be seriously urged that to assure an impartial jury for his trial it is necessary to segregate governmental employees from other citizens of the District upon the theory that the former are biased against him? What possible interest in such a case has a governmental employee different from that of any citizen who wishes to see crime properly punished but is free from any actual bias against the alleged offender? And what appears to be so obviously true in this case of larceny would be true also in criminal prosecutions in general, running the gamut of offences from murder, burglary, and robbery to cheats and disturbances of the peace. We think that the imputation of bias simply by virtue of governmental employment, without regard to any actual partiality growing out of the nature and circumstances of particular cases, rests on an assumption without any rational foundation.\n It is said that particular crimes might be of special interest to employees in certain governmental departments, as, for example, the crime of counterfeiting, to employees of the treasury. But when we consider the range of offences and the general run of criminal prosecutions, it is apparent that such cases of special interest \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 150]\n\u00a0\n would be exceptional. The law permits full inquiry as to actual bias in any such instances. We repeat, that we are not dealing with actual bias and, until the contrary appears, we must assume that the courts of the District, with power fully adequate to the occasion, will be most careful in those special instances, where circumstances suggest that any actual partiality may exist, to safeguard the just interests of the accused. While bias, as has been said, is 'an elusive condition of the mind,' that consideration affords no ground for extreme and fanciful tests. To impute bias as matter of law to the jurors in question here would be no more sensible than to impute bias to all storeowners and householders in cases of larceny or burglary.\n It is suggested that an employee of the government may be apprehensive of the termination of his employment in case he decides in favor of the accused in a criminal case. Unless the suggestion be taken to have reference to some special and exceptional case, it seems to us far- fetched and chimerical. It does not rise to the dignity of an argument to be addressed to the power of Congress to provide a reasonable scheme with respect to the qualifications of jurors. It belongs in the category of 'theoretic or imaginary' interests-' remote' and 'insignificant' as described in the Massachusetts case above cited.\n Nor are we impressed with the contention that the qualification of governmental employees for jury service in criminal cases in the District of Columbia will impair the public respect in which the processes of the law should be held. On the contrary, we think that the spectacle of the exclusion en masse from that service of a body of citizens otherwise highly desirable in point of intelligence and character-solely by reason of their employment by the Government-and the imposition in consequence of a heavier burden upon other citizens, whether that exclusion would be in deference to a supposed an- \n\n[299 U.S. 123, 151]\n\u00a0\n cient rule or because of a conclusive presumption of bias against an accused, would constitute a serious reproach to the competency and efficiency of the administration of the system of jury trials.\n What has been said applies with equal force to the provisions of the statute qualifying those who receive governmental pensions and gratuities.\n Fourth. Respondent also raises the question of the validity of the statute under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. For the reasons already given, we find nothing arbitrary or capricious in the legislative action.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the judgment of conviction is affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the case is controlled by our decision in Crawford v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 183\n, 29 S.Ct. 260, 15 Ann.Cas. 392, and that the rule there laid down should not now be departed from. They think the opinion of the court below is sound, and that its judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provision is as follows:\n'All executive and judicial officers of the Government of the United States and of the District of Columbia, all officers and enlisted men of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard of the United States in active service, those connected with the police and fire departments of the United States and of the District of Columbia, counselors and attorneys at law in actual practice, ministers of the gospel and clergymen of every denomination, practicing physicians and surgeons, keepers of hospitals, asylums, almshouses, or other charitable institutions created by or under the laws relating to the District of Columbia, captains and masters and other persons employed on vessels navigating the waters of the District of Columbia shall be exempt from jury duty, and their names shall not be placed on the jury lists.\n\n'All other persons, otherwise qualified according to law whether employed in the service of the Government of the United States or of the District of Columbia, all officers and enlisted men of the National Guard of the District of Columbia, both active and retired, all officers and enlisted men of the Military, Naval, Marine, and Coast Guard Reserve Corps of the United States, all notaries public, all postmasters and those who are the recipients or beneficiaries of a pension or other gratuity from the Federal or District Government or who have contracts with the United States or the District of Columbia, shall be qualified to serve as jurors in the District of Columbia and shall not be exempt from such service: Provided, That employees of the Government of the United States or of the District of Columbia in active service who are called upon to sit on juries shall not be paid for such jury service but their salary shall not be diminished during their term of service by virtue of such service, nor shall such period of service be deducted from any leave of absence authorized by law.'\n\n\n This act amended the prior provision known as section 217 of the Code of Law for the District of Columbia approved March 3, 1901 (Code D.C.1929 tit. 18,  360), which provided:\n'Exemption from jury service.-All executive and judicial officers, salaried officers of the Government of the United States and of the District of Columbia, all officers and enlisted men of the National Guard for the District of Columbia, both active and retired, and those connected with the police or fire departments, counselors and attorneys at law in actual practice, ministers of the gospel and clergymen of every denomination, practicing physicians and surgeons, keepers of hospitals, asylums, almshouses, or other charitable institutions created by or under the laws relating to the District, captains and masters and other persons employed on vessels navigating the waters of the District shall be exempt from jury duty, and their names shall not be placed on the jury lists.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Fitzherbert, Abridgment, Challenge,  17, 63, 65, folios 172, 173 ( 1577 Ed.); Brooke, Abridgment, Challenge,  154, 155, folio 126; Staunforde, Pleas of the Crown, 162; Coke upon Littleton, I, 156a-156b; Hale, Pleas of the Crown, II, 271; Rolle, Abridgment, II, 645-646; Duncombe, Trials per Pais (9th Ed.) pp. 166, 167, 175, 189, 196, 203; Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, II, c. 43,  32, 33; Bacon, Abridgment, V, Juries, 355; Viner, Abridgments, XXI, Trial, 243; Hargrave's Coke upon Littleton, I, 156; Chitty, Criminal Law, I, 539. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Year Books, 19 Ass. 62, pl. 6, 4 Henry VII, 8, P. pl. 6; 4 Henry VII, 3, H. pl. 5; King v.

Coudert, Jr., of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents sued out writs of habeas corpus to prevent their extradition to France under the Treaty of 1939 (37 Stat. 1526). They are native-born citizens of the United States and are charged with the commission of crimes in France which are among the extraditable offenses specified in the treaty. Having fled to the United States, they were arrested in New York City, on the request of the French authorities, under a preliminary warrant issued by a United States Commissioner and were held for extradition proceedings. By the writs of habeas corpus the jurisdiction of the Commissioner was challenged upon the ground that because the treaty excepted citizens of the United States, the President had no constitutional authority to surrender the respondents to the French Republic.\n The controlling provisions of the treaty are as follows:\n'Article I. The Government of the United States and the Government of France mutually agree to deliver up persons who, having been charged with or convicted of any of the crimes or offenses specified in the following article, committed within the jurisdiction of one of the contracting Parties, shall seek an asylum or be found within the territories of the other: Provided That this shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his or her \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 7]\n\u00a0\n apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime or offense had been there committed. ...\n\n'Article V. Neither of the contracting Parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens or subjects under the stipulations of this convention.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the orders of the District Judge, sustained the contention of the respondents and directed their discharge. 81 F.(2d) 32. This Court granted certiorari. \n298 \nU.S. 647\n, 56 S. Ct. 680\n\n\n First. The question is not one of policy, but of legal authority. The United States has favored the extradition of nationals of the asylum state and has sought-frequently without success-to negotiate treaties of extradition including them. \n1\n Several of our treaties have made no exception of nationals. \n2\n This is true of the treaties with Great Britain from the beginning, of the treaty with France of 1843, and of that with Italy of 1868. Charlton v. Kelly, \n229 \nU.S. 447, 467\n, 33 S.Ct. 945, 46 L.R.A. (N.S.) 397. Where treaties have provided for the extradition of persons without exception, the United States has always construed its obligation as embracing its citizens. Id., \n229 U.S. 447\n, at page 468, 33 S.Ct. 945, 951, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 397. In the opinion in Charlton v. Kelly we alluded to the fact that it had 'come to be the practice with a preponderant number of nations to refuse to deliver its citizens' and it was observed that this exception was of modern origin. The \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 8]\n\u00a0\n beginning of the exemption was traced to the practice between France and the Low Countries in the eighteenth century. And we found that owing 'to the existence in the municipal law of many nations of provisions prohibition the extradition of citizens, the United States has in several of its extradition treaties clauses exempting citizens from their obligation.' Accordingly we divided the treaties in force into two classes, 'those which expressly exempt citizens, and those which do not.' Id., \n229 U.S. 447\n, at pages 466, 467, 33 S.Ct. 945, 952, 46 L.R.A.(N. S.) 397.\n The effect of the exception of citizens in the treaty with France of 1909-now under consideration-must be determined in the light of the principles which inhere in our constitutional system. The desirability- frequently asserted by the representatives of our government and demonstrated by their arguments and the discussions of juries-of providing for the extradition of nationals of the asylum state is not a substitute for constitutional authority. The surrender of its citizens by the government of the United States must find its sanction in our law.\n It cannot be doubted that the power to provide for extradition is a national power; it pertains to the national government and not to the states. United States v. Rauscher, \n119 U.S. 407\n, 412-414, 7 S.Ct. 234. But, albeit a national power, it is not confided to the Executive in the absence of treaty or legislative provision. At the very beginning, Mr. Jefferson, as Secretary of State, advised the President: 'The laws of the United States, like those of England, receive every fugitive, and no authority has been given to their Executives to deliver them up.' \n3\n As stated by John Bassett Moore in his treaties on Extradition- summarizing the precedents-'the general opinion \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 9]\n\u00a0\n has been, and practice has been in accordance with it, that in the absence of a conventional or legislative provision, there is no authority vested in any department of the government to seize a fugitive criminal and surrender him to a foreign power.' \n4\n Counsel for the petitioners do not challenge the soundness of this general opinion and practice. It rests upon the fundamental consideration that the Constitution creates no executive prerogative to dispose of the liberty of the individual. Proceedings against him must be authorized by law. There is no executive discretion to surrender him to a foreign government, unless that discretion is granted by law. It necessarily follows that as the legal authority does not exist save as it is given by act of Congress or by the terms of a treaty, it is not enough that statute or treaty does not deny the power to surrender. It must be found that statute or treaty confers the power.\n Second. Whatever may be the power of the Congress to provide for extradition independent of treaty, that power has not been exercised save in relation to a foreign country or territory 'occupied by or under the control of the United States.' Act June 6, 1900, c. 793, 31 Stat. 656 (18 U.S.C.  652, 18 U.S.C.A.  652). See Neely v. Henkel, \n180 \nU.S. 109, 122\n, 21 S.Ct. 302. Aside from that limited provision, the Act of Congress relating to extradition simply defines the procedure to carry out an existing extradition treaty or convention. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The provision is that-'Whenever there is a treaty or convention for extradition between the Government of the United States and any foreign government'-a proceeding may be instituted to procure the surrender of a person charged with the commission of a crime specified in the treaty or convention. Upon the apprehension of \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 10]\n\u00a0\n the accused, he is entitled to a hearing and, upon evidence deemed to be sufficient to sustain the charge 'under the provisions of the proper treaty or convention,' the charge with the evidence is to be certified to the Secretary of State to the end that a warrant may issue upon the requisition of the proper authorities of such foreign government, 'for the surrender of such person, according to the stipulations of the treaty or convention.' R.S.  5270 (18 U.S.C.  651, 18 U.S.C.A.  651).\n It is manifest that the act does not attempt to confer power upon the Executive to surrender any person, much less a citizen of the United States, to a foreign government where an extradition treaty or convention does not provide for such surrender. The question then, is the narrow one whether the power to surrender the respondents in this instance is conferred by the treaty itself.\n Third. It is a familiar rule that the obligations of treaties should be liberally construed so as to give effect to the apparent intention of the parties. Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 424, 437\n, 22 S.Ct. 195; Jordan v. Tashiro, \n278 \nU.S. 123, 127\n, 49 S.Ct. 47, 48; Factor v. Laubenheimer, \n290 \nU.S. 276, 293\n, 294 S., 54 S.Ct. 191, 195, 196. But, in this instance, there is no question for construction so far as the obligations of the treaty are concerned. The treaty is explicit in the denial of any obligation to surrender citizens of the asylum state-'Neither of the contracting Parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens.'\n Does the treaty, while denying an obligation in such case, contain a grant of power to surrender a citizen of the United States in the discretion of the Executive? The Constitution (article 6, cl. 2) declares a treaty to be the law of the land. It is consequently, as Chief Justice Marshall said in Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 314, 'to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the legislature, whenever it operates of itself, without the aid of any legislative provision.' See, also, Head Money Cases, \n112 \nU.S. 580, 598\n, 5 S.Ct. 247; \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 11]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Rauscher, supra, \n119 U.S. 407\n, at page 418, 7 S.Ct. 234. Examining the treaty in that aspect, it is our duty to interpret it according to its terms. These must be fairly construed, but we cannot add to or detract from them.\n Obviously the treaty contains no express grant of the power now invoked. Petitioners point to article 1, which states that the two governments 'mutually agree to deliver up persons' who are charged with any of the specified offenses. Petitioners urge that the word 'persons' includes citizens of the asylum state as well as all others. But article 1 is the agreement to deliver. It imposes the obligation of that agreement. Article 1 does not purport to grant any power to surrender save as the power is related to and derived from that obligation. The word 'persons' in article 1 describes those who fall within the agreement and with respect to whom the obligation is assumed. As article 5 provides that there shall be no obligation on the part of either party to deliver up its own citizens, the latter are necessarily excepted from the agreement in article 1 and from the 'persons' there described. The fact that the exception is contained in a separate article does not alter its effect. That effect is precisely the same as though article 1 had read that the two governments 'mutually agree to deliver up persons except its own citizens or subjects.'\n May a grant to the Executive of discretionary power to surrender citizens of the United States be implied? Petitioners seek to find ground for this implication by comparing the expression in article 5 'Neither of the contracting parties shall be bound,' in relation to the surrender of citizens, with the phrase in article 6 that 'A fugitive criminal shall not be surrendered' if the offense charged is of a political character, and the clause in article 8 that extradition 'shall not be granted' where prosecution is barred by limitation according to the laws of the asylum country. This difference in the phrasing \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 12]\n\u00a0\n of denials of obligation would be at the best an extremely tenuous basis for implying a power which in order to exist must be affirmatively granted. Of far greater significance is the fact that a familiar clause-found in several of our treaties-which qualifies the exception of citizens by expressly conferring discretionary power to surrender them was omitted in the treaty with France.\n The treaty with Japan of 1886 provided in article 7:6 'Neither of the contracting parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens or subjects under the stipulations of this convention, but they shall have the power to deliver them up if in their discretion it be deemed proper to do so.'\n A similar provision is found in the extradition treaties with the Argentine Republic, of 1896, and with the Orange Free State, of 1896.7 The treaties with Mexico, of 1899, with Guatemala, of 1903, with Nicaragua, of 1905, and with Uruguay, of 1905, expressly lodge the discretionary power with the 'executive authority.' Thus in the treaty with Mexico of 1899 we find the following article (article 4): 'Neither of the contracting parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens under the stipulations of this convention, but the executive authority of each shall have \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 13]\n\u00a0\n the power to deliver them up, if, in its discretion, it be deemed proper to do so.'8\n We must assume that the representatives of the United States had these clauses before them when they negotiated the treaty with France and that the omission was deliberate. And the fact that our government had favored extradition treaties without excepting citizens puts the omission of the qualifying grant of discretionary power in a strong light.\n Historical background and administrative practice furnish no warrant for reading into the treaty with France a grant which the parties failed to insert. History and practice not only do not support, but they rather negative, the claim of an implied discretionary power. The language of article 5 of the treaty with France first appears in our extradition treaty with Prussia in 1852,9 and it was repeated in a number of later treaties including the Mexican treaty of 1861.10 It seems that the question as to the effect of the provision first arose under the last- mentioned treaty. Mr. Moore reviews the cases. \n11\n In 1871 the United States requested the surrender of fugitives who had escaped to Mexico. It appeared that they were Mexican citizens. The Mexican government refused surrender, stating that its action 'should be in strict conformity with the stipulations of the treaty of extradition' and \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 14]\n\u00a0\n with 'the practice observed' by the government of the United States toward the Mexican government 'in similar cases.' In 1874, one Perez, a Mexican, committed a murder in Texas and escaped to Mexico. Our Secretary of State, Mr. Fish, instructed the American Ambassador that although the surrender could not be demanded as of right and would not be asked as a favor, or even accepted with an understanding that it would be reciprocated, the circumstances might be made known to the Mexican government with a view to ascertain whether it would voluntarily surrender the fugitive. The Mexican government declined the surrender. In another case, arising in 1877, the question of the power of the Mexican government to surrender its citizens to the United States came before its federal Supreme Court. While it appeared that the fact of Mexican citizenship was not conclusively established, the court was of the view that the individual guarantees of the Mexican Constitution would not be violated by the surrender.\n The question was elaborately considered in the case of Trimble in 1884. He was an American citizen whose extradition was demanded by the Mexican government. Our government refused surrender. Mr. Frelinghuysen, Secretary of State, took the ground that as the treaty negatived the obligation to surrender, the President was not invested with legal authority to act. While it is true that Secretary Frelinghuysen later concluded that the question was of such importance that it should receive judicial determination, the view he entertained as to the President's lack of power was cogently stated. \n12\n Re- \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 15]\n\u00a0\n ferring to that view, Mr. Moore adds: 'To this position the government of the United States has adhered.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Secretary Bayard in the case of Hudson, in 1888, followed the ruling in the Trimble case. He said: 'The treaty provision referred to, which is found similarly stated in \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 16]\n\u00a0\n many of our extradition treaties, was held to negative any obligation to surrender, and thus to leave the authorities of this government without authority to act in such a case. After due consideration, the department is of opinion that the construction given to the treaty in the Trimble Case is correct.' See Ex parte McCabe (D.C.) 46 F. 363, 379, 12 L.R.A. 589. Secretary Blaine, in 1891, in refusing to ask for the surrender of Mexican citizens, took the same position, saying: 'In view of this' (the Trimble case) 'and several prior and subsequent cases in which a similar construction has been given to the treaty, the government is precluded from demanding the extradition of the fugitives in the present instance.' Id.\n In this situation, the question of the construction of the treaty with Mexico came before the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Texas in 1891. Mrs. McCabe, an American citizen who was held for extradition proceedings on the charge that she had committed the crime of murder in Mexico, sued out a writ of habeas corpus. In an elaborate opinion reviewing the precedents, Judge Maxey ruled that there was no authority to surrender and directed her discharge from custody. Ex parte McCabe, supra. The case was not appealed.\n In the light of this concurrence of administrative and judicial views a new extradition treaty with Mexico was negotiated (1899). That treaty, as we have seen, repeated the exception with respect to citizens, but, following the precedent of the treaties with Japan, the Argentine Republic and the Orange Free State,14 added the qualifying words 'but the executive authority of each shall have the power to deliver them up, if, in its discretion, it be deemed proper to do so.' And the same qualification was inserted in the later treaties above mentioned. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n[299 U.S. 5, 17]\n\u00a0\n Petitioners insist that the precedents fall short of showing a uniform course of practical construction favorable to the respondents. The argument is unavailing. What is more to the point is that administrative practice is not shown to be favorable to the petitioners. Strictly, the question is not whether there had been a uniform practical construction denying the power, but whether the power had been so clearly recognized that the grant should be implied. The administrative rulings to which we have referred make the latter conclusion wholly inadmissible.\n The treaty with France of 1843 made no exception of citizens. France, however, refused to recognize an obligation under that treaty to surrender her citizens. \n16\n In inserting the exception in the new treaty, a clause was chosen under which Secretaries of State and a federal court had held that the President had no discretionary power to surrender citizens of this country. Notwithstanding this, that excepting clause was inserted without qualification, and a familiar clause granting a discretionary power was omitted. No provision was inserted to confer such a power. It was upon that basis that the treaty was negotiated and ratified. In these circumstances we know of no rule of construction which would permit us to supply the omission.\n Against these considerations, the inference sought to be drawn from the French 'expose des motifs' accompanying the treaty, and more particularly from the 'expose ' accompanying the Franco-British treaty of 1908, is of slight weight. \n 17\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioners strongly rely upon the decision in England in In re Galwey (1896), 1 Q.B.D. 230; compare Reg. v. Wilson, 3 Q.B.D. 42 (1877). But, as the Circuit Court \n\n[299 U.S. 5, 18]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals points out, the Anglo-Belgian treaty there under consideration had its own history and background-quite different from that which we have here-upon which the case turned. It does not present a persuasive analogy.\n Applying, as we must, our own law in determining the authority of the President, we are constrained to hold that his power, in the absence of statute conferring an independent power, must be found in the terms of the treaty and that, as the treaty with France fails to grant the necessary authority, the President is without power to surrender the respondents.\n However regrettable such a lack of authority may be, the remedy lies with the Congress, or with the treaty-making power wherever the parties are willing to provide for the surrender of citizens, and not with the courts.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Moore, Int.Law Dig., vol.

See Moore on Extradition, vol. I, pp. 167, 168. Discussing the constitutional powers of the President, Mr. Frelinghuysen concluded:\n'Thus it appears that, by the opinions of several Attorneys-General, by the decisions of our courts, and by the rulings of the Department of State, the President has not, independent of treaty provision, the power of extraditing an American citizen; and the only question to be considered is whether the treaty with Mexico confers that power.\n\n'By the treaty with Mexico proclaimed June 20, 1862, this country places itself under obligations to Mexico to surrender to justice persons accused of enumerated crimes committed within the jurisdiction of Mexico who shall be found within the territory of the United States; and further provides that that obligation shall not extend to the surrender of American citizens. The treaty confers upon the President no affirmative power to surrender an American citizen. The treaty between the United States and Mexico creates an obligation on the part of the respective governments, and does no more, and where the obligation ceases the power falls. \n\n It is true that treaties are the laws of the land, but a statute and a treaty are subject to different modes of construction. If a statute by the first section should say, The President of the United States shall surrender to any friendly power any person who has committed a crime against the laws of that power, but shall not be bound so to surrender American citizens, it might be argued, perhaps correctly, that the President had a discretion whether he would or would not surrender an American citizen. But a treaty is a contract, and must be so construed. It confers upon the President only the power to perform that contract. I understand the treaty with Mexico as reading thus: The President shall be bound to surrender any person guilty of crime, unless such person is a citizen of the United States.\n'Such being the construction of the treaty, and believing that the time to prevent a violation of the law of extradition was before the citizens left the jurisdiction of the United States, I telegraphed the Governor of Texas that an American citizen could not legally be held under the treaty for extradition.\n\n'It would be a great evil that those guilty of high crime, whether American citizens or not, should go unpunished; but even that result could not justify in usurpation of power.' \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Moore on Extradition, vol.

Haley, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Lane Summers, F. T. Merritt, and W. H. Hayden, all of Seattle, Wash., for respondents. \n\n[297 U.S. 114, 115]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this libel in 1931, in the District Court for the Western District of Washington, against the vessel 'Taigen Maru,' for personal injuries which he sustained as a seaman in 1922. The vessel was then known as the 'Luise Nielsen' and was of Norwegian registry. The respondent Ocean Transport Company, Limited, a Japanese corporation, made claim as owner, and filed exceptions alleging that a final decree had been entered in the District Court for the District of Oregon in 1924, dismissing a libel, for the same cause, on the intervention of the Norwegian consul.\n In the present case, there was again an intervention by the Norwegian consul, who claimed that, while the vessel was now Japanese, he was nevertheless officially concerned, as the former Norwegian owner had agreed to deliver the vessel 'free from all debts and encumbrances.' The consul filed exceptive allegations to the effect that the libelant, a Dutch subject, had signed Norwegian articles and, so far as his rights as a seaman were concerned, was bound by the laws of Norway, which provided for appropriate remedies. The consul asked that, if the cause was not dismissed because of the former decree, the dispute should be left for his adjustment and disposition. The libelant made response and, on hearing, the District Court dismissed the cause 'in the exercise of its discretion.'\n The Circuit Court of App als affirmed the decree, but upon the ground that the dismissal should have been for want of jurisdiction rather than as an exercise of discretion. The Taigen Maru, 73 F.(2d) 922. The court based its decision upon the second paragraph of article 13 of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, of July 4, 1827, between the United States and the Kingdom of Sweden and Norway, the text \n\n[297 U.S. 114, 116]\n\u00a0\n of which is given in the margin. \n1\n The court assumed that this provision was still in effect, apparently not being advised of the fact that articles 13 and 14 of that treaty had been terminated in 1919. See Foreign Relations of the United States, 1919, pp. 47-54.\n Section 16 of the Seamen's Act of March 4, 1915 (22 U.S.C.A.  258 note)2 expressed 'the judgment of Congress' that treaty provisions in conflict with the provisions of the act 'ought to be terminated,' and the President was 'requested and directed' to give notice to that effect to the several governments concerned within ninety days after the passage of the act. It appears that, in consequence, notice was given and that a large number of treaties were terminated in whole or in part. \n3\n The Treaty with Sweden and Norway of 1827 provided that it might be terminated, after an initial period of ten years, upon one year's notice. \n4\n On February 2, 1918, the governmet gave notice to the Norwegian government of the denunciation of the treaty in its entirety, to take effect on February 2, 1919, but later by an exchange of diplomatic \n\n[297 U.S. 114, 117]\n\u00a0\n notes, this government formally withdrew its denunciation, except as to articles 13 and 14. Foreign Relations of the United States, 1919, pp. 50- 52. It was expressly stated that articles 13 and 14 of the treaty, being in conflict with provisions of the Seamen's Act, were deemed to be terminated on July 1, 1916, so far as the laws of the United States were concerned. Id., pp. 53, 54.\n On June 5, 1928, the two governments signed a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Consular Rights, and on February 25, 1929, an additional article, which supplanted the Treaty of 1827 (so far as the latter had remained effective), save that article 1 of the former treaty, concerning the entry and residence of the nationals of the one country in the territories of the other for the purposes of trade, was continued in force. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n Respondent contends: (1) That the Seamen's Act did not specifically direct the abrogation of article 13; (2) that the act was not so unavoidably inconsistent with all the provisions of article 13 as to require its entire abrogation; and (3) that the diplomatic negotiations attempting to effect abrogation of the whole of article 13 'were in excess of congressional direction and in violation of constitutional authority.'\n The first and second points are unavailing, if article 13 was actually abrogated in its entirety, and that this was the urport of the diplomatic exchanges between the two governments is beyond dispute. As to the third point, we think that the question as to the authority of the Executive in the absence of congressional action, or of action by the treaty-making power, to denounce a treaty of the United States, is not here involved. In this instance, the Congress requested and directed the President to give notice of the termination of the treaty provi- \n\n[297 U.S. 114, 118]\n\u00a0\n sions in conflict with the act. From every point of view, it was incumbent upon the President, charged with the conduct of negotiations with foreign governments and also with the duty to take care that the laws of the United States are faithfully executed, to reach a conclusion as to the inconsistency between the provisions of the treaty and the provisions of the new law. It is not possible to say that his conclusion as to articles 13 and 14 was arbitrary or inadmissible. Having determined that their termination was necessary, the President through the Secretary of State took appropriate steps to effect it. Norway agreed to the termination of articles 13 and 14 and her consul cannot be heard to question it.\n The injuries, of which libelant complains, took place after that termination. The effect of the new treaty we need not, and do not, consider, as in any event it could not be regarded as retroactively affecting the jurisdiction of the District Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals fell into error in sustaining the dismissal of the cause upon the ground of want of jurisdiction by reason of the treaty provision invoked. We express no opinion upon any other questions which the cause may present, as these have not been considered by the courts below. They should be considered and determined.\n The decree is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8 Stat. 346, 352.

In the course of its business, the company acted as an insurance carrier for employers in relation to claims under the compensation laws of New York and other States. Upon his first report, the liquidator sought the direction of the state court to pay in full, as preferred under section 34 of the Workmen's Compensation Law of New York (Consol. Laws N.Y. c. 67), all compensation claimants who had filed preferred claims under the New York law and whose claims the liquidator had allowed.\n Appellants are holders of awards of compensation against the company under the laws of Minnesota. They appeared in the proceedings for liquidation and objected to the preference of the New York claimants. The Supreme Court of the State sustained the preference and ordered distribution accordingly. The Court of Appeals affirmed the order. In re People, by Van Schaick, 266 N.Y. 589, 195 N.E. 213, 214. Appeal to this Court was dismissed. Villa v. Van Schaick, \n296 \nU.S. 544\n, 56 S.Ct. 153. The Court of Appeals amended its remittitur so as to recite that a federal question was presented and necessarily passed upon, in that the court held that section 34 of the Workmen's Compensation Law of New York was not repugnant to section 2 of article 4 and section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The Court of Appeals thereupon vacated the judgment \n\n[299 U.S. 152, 154]\n\u00a0\n previously entered and directed the entry of a new judgment which, after a further amendment of the remittitur, was entered on April 1, 1936, and from which this appeal was taken within the time allowed by law.\n It appears from the record that the business had its origin with the Southern Surety Company of Oklahoma which was incorporated in that State in 1907; that the Oklahoma company took over the business of other companies in Missouri, Michigan, Indiana, and New Mexico; that in 1918 the Southern Surety Company of Iowa was organized and took over the business of the Oklahoma company; that in 1928 the Southern Surety Company of New York was incorporated, assuming the liabilities and receiving most of the assets of the Iowa company; that the business of the New York company grew rapidly, but that in March, 1932, it was found to be insolvent and the liquidator took charge.\n The Court of Appeals stated in its order that 'In this case the New York assets are concededly more than sufficient for the payment of the preferences allowed. See Clark v. Williard, \n294 \nU.S. 211\n, 55 S.Ct. 356 (98 A.L.R. 347) decided February 5, 1935. We pass on no other situation.' The record discloses that when the liquidator took possession of the assets in March, 1932, the aggregate 'was sufficient to pay the New York compensation claims in full without resorting to any assets received by the liquidator thereafter from sources outside the State of New York,' but that the assets so taken over 'had been derived from the general conduct of the insurance business during the preceding years throughout the United States.'\n Appellants contend that 'the New York assets' to which the Court of Appeals referred were the commingled assets owned by the company at the time the liquidator took possession and derived from the operations of the company throughout the country, and not simply assets which had been derived from the business of the company in the State of New York. The liquidator appear \n\n[299 U.S. 152, 155]\n\u00a0\n ently contends that while the preference does not apply to assets from other States brought to New York after the liquidation proceeding was instituted, it does apply to all the assets, however derived, which were in the State of New York at the time of the liquidation order, aside from the statutory deposit held in trust for the policyholders under section 71 of the state insurance law (Consol. Laws N.Y. c. 28).\n The condensed statement in the record leaves doubt as to the determination of the state court upon points bearing upon the federal question which that court has decided in upholding the preference. It does not clearly appear whether the court has determined that upon a segregation of assets there would be sufficient assets derived from the business done within the State of New York to pay the preferred claims, or whether that preference is to be satisfied out of assets resulting from operations in other States. Nor does it appear whether assets derived from business in Minnesota will be sufficient to discharge appellants' claims.\n We express no opinion as to the merits of the federal question and we think that the facts should be more fully elucidated before that question is decided here. We have frequently said that in the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction we have power not only to correct errors in the judgment under review but to make such disposition of the case as justice requires. In determining what justice does require we have considered changes, either in fact or law, supervening since the judgment was entered and in such cases we have set aside the judgment and remanded the cause so that the state court might be free to act. We think that the fundamental principle involved in such action applies as well to cases where the record before us does not adequately show the facts underlying the decision of the state court of the federal question and opportunity should be given for their appropriate presentation either through amendment of the record or by further proof as the state \n\n[299 U.S. 152, 156]\n\u00a0\n court may be advised.

Johnson, of New Orleans, La., for appellee.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Appellant is a sublessee of lands leased by the state of Louisiana in 1924 to the Terre aux Boeufs Drainage District. The lands had become the property of the state by an adjudication for unpaid taxes of 1911 to 1923. The lease by the state contained a clause that the lease woule end in case the lands were redeemed by the former owner or sold by the state. At the time the lease and sublease \n\n[297 U.S. 119, 120]\n\u00a0\n were made, the lands could be redeemed only by payment of all taxes, penalties, and interest due at the date of redemption. By a subsequent statute, Act No. 161 of 1934, the Legislature of Louisiana permitted redemption on different and less onerous terms, that is, by the payment, on an installment basis, of the actual taxes for which the property had been adjudicated to the state. Under that statute, certificates for the redemption of the lands in question were issued by the register of the state land office. Appellant then sought mandamus to compel the cancellation of the certificates, upon the ground that the Act of 1934 violated the Constitution of the United States (article 1,  10, cl. 1; Amend. 14) in that the act impaired the obligation of appellant's contract of lease, deprived appellant of its property without due process of law, and denied to appellant the equal protection of the laws. Judgment against the appellant was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. That court decided that there was no impairment of the contract as the clause in the original lease, making it subject to redemption, was 'free of ambiguity and without limitation as to the conditions under which the properties embraced in the lease might be redeemed or sold, or the price to be paid therefor.'

Grace, 182 La. 405, 162 So. 26, 28.\n While this Court, when the contract clause of the Federal Constitution is invoked, may determine for itself the meaning and effect of the contract (Larson v.

The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n1\n Certiorari was granted (\n298 \nU.S. 652\n, 56 S.Ct. 956) limited to the question whether the statute \n\n[299 U.S. 92, 93]\n\u00a0\n upon which the second count of the indictment was based was repealed by the National Prohibition Act2 and has not been re-enacted.\n Many of the existing revenue acts imposing taxes in respect of manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors were superseded by the National Prohibition Act. 3 The effect of section 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act4 was to re-enact all such laws in existence when national prohibition became effective, save such as were in direct conflict with any provision of the National Prohibition Act or the Willis-Campbell Act. \n5\n The statutes taxing the business of conducting a wholesale liquor business and imposing the penalties for so doing without the payment of the tax6 were not in direct conflict with the prohibition act and were, therefore, re-enacted. \n7\n The difficulty of paying the excise upon the privilege of carrying on a business which is prohibited does not preclude the prescription of sanctions for nonpayment. \n8\n Petitioners insist it is a contradiction in terms to say the laws of the United States at the same time prohibit and license an occupation. The contention is based on misconception of the nature of the exaction. The United States has not licensed the liquor business but, as clearly within its power, has laid an \n\n[299 U.S. 92, 94]\n\u00a0\n excise upon the doing of the business whether lawfully or unlawfully conducted. \n 9\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 82 F.(2d) 305. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of October 28, 1919, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, U.S.C. tit. 27, passim (27 U.S.C.A.). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] United States v.

Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Wendell Berge, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n\n\n[298 U.S. 229, 234]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 6(b) of the Grain Futures Act, September 21, 1922, c. 369, 42 Stat. 998, 1001 (7 U.S.C.A.  9), provides that if the Secretary of Agriculture has reason to believe that any person 'is violating' any provision of the act, or any rules and regulations made pursuant thereto, or 'is attempting' to manipulate the market price of grain in violation of the provisions of the act, the Secretary may serve upon the person a complaint stating his charge in that respect and requiring him 'to show cause why an order should not be made directing that all contract markets until further notice of the said commission refuse all trading privileges thereon to such person.' The commission referred to is a board 'composed of the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General' (section 6(a), 7 U.S.C.A.  8), before whom the hearing on the complaint is had. This case is here to review a decree of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which set aside an order entered by the commission under that section. Certiorari was granted (\n297 \nU.S. 701\n, 56 S.Ct. 596) on account of the novelty and importance of the question presented.\n April 11, 1934, the Secretary of Agriculture caused such a complaint to be served upon Arthur W. Cutten. It recited that during the years 1930 and 1931 he was, and since had been, continuously a member of the Chicago Board of Trade; and that by its regulations made pursuant to the Grain Futures Act he was required 'to report to the Grain Futures Administration his net position in futures owned or controlled by him, long or short, by grain and by future, when he had net open \n\n[298 U.S. 229, 235]\n\u00a0\n commitments in any one future equal to or in excess of 500,000 bushels ; ...' (and also) 'daily trades made by him on the Board of Trade, in futures in which he owned or controlled open commitments equal to or in excess of 500,000 bushels.'\n The complaint alleged further that:\n'During the years 1930 and 1931 (he) conspired and colluded with various persons and grain firms of the Board of Trade to conceal his trading and position in the market from the Grain Futures Administration. In furtherance of said conspiracy, respondent made inaccurate, incorrect and false reports of his position in the market to the Grain Futures Administration, failed and refused to report accurately and correctly his position in the market and trades made by him,' etc.\n\n Then followed, in 44 numbered paragraphs, specifications of Cutten's alleged violations of the regulations and the act on dates between March 6, 1930, and December 31, 1931\n\n\n A referee was appointed to take the evidence. The hearings before him began on May 14, 1934. Upon the opening of those proceedings, Cutten moved to quash the complaint on the ground that section 6(b) empowered the commission to act only against persons who are presently committing offenses; and that consequently it had no authority to deny to him trading privileges for violations committed more than two years prior to the institution of the proceedings against him. The referee, without passing upon the motion to quash, proceeded to take the evidence; the hearings before him were concluded May 24, 1934; then the commission heard the complaint on briefs and oral argument; and before it the motion to quash was renewed. On February 12, 1935, the commission overruled the motion; made findings of fact on the evidence; concluded that Cutten's conduct 'constitutes a violation of the Grain Futures Act, \n\n[298 U.S. 229, 236]\n\u00a0\n and the Rules and Regulations made pursuant thereto'; and ordered that 'all contract markets refuse all trading privileges thereon to Arthur W. Cutten for a period of two years from March 1, 1935.'\n This suit was brought to set aside that order. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the power conferred by section 6(b) is remedial, not punitive; that it is limited to suspending a trader who 'is violating any of the provisions of this Act (chapter), or is attempting to manipulate the market price of any grain,' in other words, one who is presently committing an offense; that at the time of the filing of the complaint there was no wrong existing to be remedied, the latest wrongdoing complained of having occurred more than two years before the filing of the complaint by the Secretary of Agriculture; that, therefore, the commission was without authority to entertain the complaint, and should have granted the motion to quash. 80 F.(2d) 140, 142.\n The government argues that, since violations of the reporting requirements by their very nature cannot be detected during the course of commission, the literal construction thus given to section 6(b) renders it impractical and ineffective as a means of dealing with those persons who violate any of the provisions of the act or attempt to manipulate the market price of grain. Incidents in the history of the legislation are cited to support the government's contention. In reply, it is argued that ample remedy is afforded by other provisions of the act; that these confer broad power over boards of trade; and that the boards of trade may control their own members. It is urged that for the construction given to section 6(b) by the lower court support may be found in the different language employed in section 6(a). For it authorizes the commission to suspend 'or to revoke the designation of a board of trade as a 'contract market' upon a showing that such board of trade has failed or is failing to comply' \n\n[298 U.S. 229, 237]\n\u00a0\n with the requirements prescribed. Attention is also called to the penalty provisions of section 9.\n It would be inappropriate for us to discuss these, and other, arguments presented. The language of section 6(b) is clear; and on the face of the statute, there can be no doubt concerning the intention of Congress. As was said in Iselin v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 245, 250\n, 251 S., 46 S.Ct. 248, 250: 'The statute was evidently drawn with care. Its language is plain and unambiguous. What the government asks is not a construction of a statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court, so that what was omitted, presumably (possibly) by inadvertence, may be included within its scope. To supply omissions transcends the judicial function.' A fortiori, it may not be done for the purpose of making punishable action which, on the face of the statute, is merely to be prevented.

Va., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[298 U.S. 193, 204]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal presents the question of the validity of an ad valorem property tax laid by West Virginia upon accounts receivable and bank deposits of appellant, Wheeling Steel Corporation, organized under the laws of Delaware.\n The tax statutes1 were assailed upon the ground that, as applied, they violated the due process and equal pro- \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 205]\n\u00a0\n tection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The proceeding was a statutory one, instituted by appellant in the circuit court of Ohio county, W. Va., to review a county assessment which was made as of January 1, 1933. The judgment of that court, reducing the assessment, was reversed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. In re Wheeling Steel Corporation Assessment, 115 W.Va. 553, 117 S.E. 535, 537. The circuit court then entered final judgment which the Supreme Court of Appeals refused to review. The case comes here on appeal.\n The case was submitted upon agreed statements which disclosed the following facts: The corporation maintains its principal office in Delaware through the Corporation Service Company, as permitted by the laws of that state. It keeps there a duplicate stock ledger and records of all transactions with respect to its capital stock, the originals of such ledger and records being kept in New York City. It files reports and pays franchise taxes as required by Delaware.\n The general business offices of the corporation are located in Wheeling, Ohio county, W. Va. There, the general books and accounting records are kept. The chairman of the board, president, treasurer, secretary and chief counsel reside at Wheeling. There, its stockholders' and directors' meetings, as permitted by the laws of Delaware, are held. Dividends, when declared, are ordered to be paid and distributed at meetings held at Wheeling, although the checks are drawn and distributed by the dividend disbursing agent located in New York City and are paid with funds there deposited.\n The corporation maintains sales offices in various cities of the United States. Sales contracts are negotiated and orders are taken by these offices subject to acceptance or rejection at Wheeling. \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 206]\n\u00a0\n The principal manufacturing plants of the corporation are located in the state of Ohio. The plant offices maintain original detailed accounting records showing materials received, railroad cars received and shipped, detailed labor costs, production and shipments, and detailed stocks of goods and payrolls. Employment offices are mai tained at each plant. The Portsmouth, Ohio, plant makes up and mails out invoices for all products shipped from that plant, together with bills of lading and shipping notices. The other plants prepare complete invoices with exception of information relating to the price of materials described. The latter invoices are then forwarded to Wheeling where they are completed and mailed to the customer. Bills of lading and shipping notices are, however, mailed to customers from the individual plants. All invoices are payable in Wheeling. The majority of commercial accounts are paid by check issued at Wheeling. Pay rolls are made up and payroll checks are prepared and signed at the various plants and are there distributed to the employees. Such checks are paid with funds on deposit in banks in the localities where the plants are situated.\n The corporation owns vessels operating on the Allegheny, Ohio, and Mississippi rivers, transporting coal and steel. These vessels are registered at the port of Pittsburgh.\n The total assessed value of the real estate and tangible personal property owned by the corporation on January 1, 1933, was $31,977,600. The assessed value of its real estate and tangible personal property in West Virginia was $8,673,205, or 27.10 per cent. of the total.\n At least 80 per cent. of the sums spent by the corporation in the conduct of its business, including the purchase of materials, maintenance and repairs of plants, building of improvements, property, additions, pay rolls and other operating expenses were made in connection \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 207]\n\u00a0\n with the operation of its plants and business outside the state of West Virginia and all such payments, aside from moneys borrowed, were made from the proceeds of sales of its products. The moneys thus expended in the conduct of its business in Ohio and states other than West Virginia are expended by executive action taken at Wheeling, and by the drawing of checks or drafts at that place, except in connection with the payment of pay rolls at its Portsmouth, Ohio, and Steubenville, Ohio, plants, where pay-roll checks or orders are drawn against moneys sent to banks at those points for the express purpose of meeting the pay rolls and for incidental items as they arise. All moneys are controlled and the expenditures directed by the Wheeling office, and if the immediate expenditure be made elsewhere, it is made only under specific or general direction and control of that office.\n On January 1, 1933, the corporation had on deposit to its credit in various banks the sum of $2,307,773.61, of which $849,161.99 was on deposit in West Virginia. Of the last-mentioned amount the corporation had received $121,684.91 from sales of goods manufactured in West Virginia and the remainder from sales of goods manufactured in, and shipped from, points outside that state. The money on deposit in banks outside West Virginia on January 1, 1933, had been deposited by the corporation by sending from its Wheeling office the original checks or drafts received from its customers. The deposits outside West Virginia are not segregated for the purpose of keeping separately the receipts from sales of products manufactured in, and shipped from, West Virginia plants. Ordinarily not more than 20 per cent. of the total amounts on deposit at any time within and without West Virginia have been derived from sales of products manufactured in that state.\n The total amount of the corporation's accounts and notes receivable on January 1, 1933, was $2,234,743.11. \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 208]\n\u00a0\n Of this amount, $374,410.42 were receivables for goods sold and manufactured in, and shipped from, West Virginia to resident and nonresident purchasers. It appeared that the corporation had been assessed in Ohio, as of January 1, 1933, on accounts and notes receivable amounting to $250,133.42.\n The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia held that there had been 'such a localization of the corporation's business at Wheeling' that there was imparted 'to its entire intangible property a prima acie situs for taxation at that place.' But the court thought that the 'statutory limitation of the assessment to property 'liable to taxation\" indicated that the legislature 'did not propose to tax intangibles which were primarily subject to taxation in another jurisdiction.' And referring to the above mentioned taxation in Ohio, the Supreme Court of Appeals said: 'For the purposes of this opinion, we assume that the claim of our sister state is well founded, and should be deducted from the assessment as corrected by the Tax Commissioner.' And in remanding the cause to the circuit court, the Supreme Court of Appeals gave opportunity to have it determined 'whether or not further deductions should be made in deference to the legal demands of other states.' In the further proceeding in the circuit court, it was stipulated that 'no states other than Ohio and West Virginia have assessed taxpayer upon any of its intangibles for the year 1933.'\n First. The tax is not a privilege or occupation tax. It is not a tax on net income. See Hans Rees' Sons v. North Carolina, \n283 \nU.S. 123, 133\n, 51 S.Ct. 385. It is an ad valorem property tax. We have held that it is essential to the validity of such a tax, under the due process clause, that the property shall be within the territorial jurisdiction of the taxing state. This rule receives its most familiar illustration in the case of land. The rule has been ex- \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 209]\n\u00a0\n tended to tangible personal property which is thus subject to taxation exclusively in the state where it is permanently located, regardless of the domicile of the owner. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 204\n, 206 S., 26 S.Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493; Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 489\n, 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316. We have said that the application to the states of the rule of due process arises from the fact 'that their spheres of activity are enforced and protected by the Constitution, and therefore it is impossible for one state to reach out and tax property in another without violating the Constitution.' United States v. Bennett, \n232 \nU.S. 299, 306\n, 34 S.Ct. 433, 437. Compare Burnet v. Brooks, \n288 \nU.S. 378, 401\n, 53 S.Ct. 457, 86 A.L.R. 747. When we deal with intangible property, such as credits and choses in action generally, we encounter the difficulty that by reason of the absence of physical characteristics they have no situs in the physical sense, but have the situs attributable to them in legal conception. Accordingly we have held that a state may properly apply the rule mobilia sequuntur personam and treat them as localized at the owner's domicile for purposes of taxation. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204, 211\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 65 A. L.R. 1000. And having thus determined 'that in general intangibles may be properly taxed at the domicile of their owner,' we have found 'no sufficient reason for saying that they are not entitled to enjoy an immunity against taxation at more than one place similar to that accorded to tangibles.' Id., \n280 U.S. 204\n, at page 212, 50 S.Ct. 98, 100, 65 A.L.R. 1000. The principle thus announced in Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota has had progressive application. Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n, 50 S.Ct. 436, 72 A.L.R. 1303; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1\n, 51 S.Ct. 54; First National Bank v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312, 328\n, 329 S., 52 S.Ct. 174, 177, 77 A.L.R. 1401. But despite the wide application of the principle, an important exception has been recognized.\n In the case of tangible property, the ancient maxim, which had its origin when personal property consisted in \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 210]\n\u00a0\n the main of articles appertaining to the person of the owner, yielded in modern times to the 'law of the place where the property is kept and used.' First National Bank v. Maine, supra. It was in view 'of the enormous increase of such property since the introduction of railways and the growth of manufactures' that it came to be regarded as 'having a situs of its own for the purpose of taxation, and correlatively to exempt at the domicil of its owner.' Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, \n199 U.S. 194\n, at page 207, 26 S.Ct. 36, 39, 4 Ann.Cas. 493. There has been an analogous development in connection with intangible property by reason of the creation of choses in action in the conduct by an owner of his business in a state different from that of his domicile. New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 \nU.S. 309\n, 20 S.Ct. 110; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 \nU.S. 133\n, 20 S.Ct. 585; State Board of Assessors v. Comptor National, \n191 \nU.S. 388\n, 24 S.Ct. 109; Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. New Orleans, \n205 \nU.S. 395\n, 27 S.Ct. 499; Liverpool & L. & G. Insurance Co. v. Board of Assessors for Parish of Orleans, \n221 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S.Ct. 550, L.R.A. 1915C, 903.\n These cases, we said in Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, supra, \n280 U.S. 204\n, at page 213, 50 S.Ct. 98, 101, 65 A.L.R. 1000, 'recognize the principle that choses in action may acquire a situs for taxation other than at the domicile of their owner, if they have become integral parts of some local business.' We adverted to this reservation in Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, supra, \n282 U.S. 1\n, at page 8, 51 S.Ct. 54, and in First National Bank v. Maine, supra, \n284 U.S. 312\n, at page 331, 52 S.Ct. 174, 77 A.L.R. 1401\n\n\n In the instant case, both parties recognize the principle and the exception. It is appellant's contention that the state creating a corporation has the sole right to tax its intangible property 'unless such intangible property has acquired a 'business situs' elsewhere.' Counsel for the state agrees with appellant on this point and in fact asserts 'that, generally, the taxable situs of accounts receivable and of money in bank is at the domicile of the owner.' But the state insists that the accounts receiv- \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 211]\n\u00a0\n able and bank deposits of the Wheeling Steel Corporation had acquired a taxable situs in West Virginia and that they have no taxable situs in Delaware, where the corporation was chartered.\n Second. The corporation complied with the laws of the state of its creation in designating its 'principal' office in that state. It is manifest that this designation, while presumably sufficient for the purpose was a technical one and that the office is not a principal office so far as the actual conduct of business is concerned. While a duplicate stock ledger and records of transactions with respect to capital stock are maintained in Delaware, the business operations of the corporation are conducted outside that state. The office in Delaware is maintained through the service of an agency organized to furnish this convenience to corporations of that description. To attribute to Delaware, merely as the chartering state, the credits arising in the course of the business established in another state, and to deny to the latter the power to tax such credits upon the ground that it violates due process to treat the credits as within its jurisdiction, is to make a legal fiction dominate realities in a fashion quite as extreme as that which would attribute to the chartering state all the tangible possessions of the Corporation without regard to their actual location.\n The constitutional authority of West Virginia to tax the accounts receivable and bank deposits in question cannot be denied upon the ground that they are taxable solely in Delaware. The question is whether they should be deemed to be localized in West Virginia.\n Third. The corporation established in West Virginia what has aptly been termed a 'commercial domicile.' It maintains its general business offices at Wheeling and there it keeps its books and accounting records. There its directors hold their meetings and its officers conduct the affairs of the corporation. There, as appellant's \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 212]\n\u00a0\n counsel well says, 'the management functioned.' The corporation has manufacturing plants and sales offices in other states. But what is done at those plants and offices is determined and controlled from the center of authority at Wheeling. The corporation has made that the actual seat of its corporate government.\n The question here is not of the taxation of the plants in other states. The real estate, equipment, and all tangible property there located is taxable by those states respectively. The accounts receivable with which we are now concerned are the proceeds of contracts of sale. While these contracts are negotiated and orders are taken at the various sales offices throughout the country, they are subject to acceptance or rejection at the Wheeling office. All invoices are payable at Wheeling. Thus the contracts of sale become effective by the action taken at the Wheeling office and there the accounts are kept and the required payments are made. In the face of these facts, it cannot properly be said that the credits arise either where the goods are manufactured or at the sales offices where the orders are taken. The tax is not on the manufacturing or on the privilege of maintaining sales offices. The tax is not on the net profits of a unitary enterprise demanding a method, not intrinsically arbitrary, of making an apportionment among different jurisdictions with respect to the processes by which the profits are earned.

State Tax Commission, \n266 \nU.S. 271, 282\n, 283 S., 45 S.Ct. 82; Hans Rees' Sons v. North Carolina, supra. Such a tax on net gains is distinct from an ad valorem property tax on the various items of property owned by the corporation and laid according to the location of the property within the respective tax jurisdictions. Here, the tax is a property tax on the accounts receivable, as separate items of property, and these are not to be regarded as parts of the manufacturing plants where the goods sold are produced. \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 213]\n\u00a0\n Hence we cannot agree with appellant's counsel that the only fair rule in such a case is one 'which allocates intangibles on the basis of tangible property owned and used in production of material for sale.' This is to confuse two distinct subjects of ad valorem property taxation, the accounts receivable which arise from sales and the manufacturing plants. The accounts are not necessarily localized in whole or in part where the goods are made but are attributable as choses in action to the place where they arise in the course of the business of making contracts of sale. We said, in Virginia v. Imperial Coal Sales Co., \n293 \nU.S. 15, 20\n, 55 S.Ct. 12, 14, that we were not able to perceive 'any sound reason for holding that the owner must have real estate or tangible property within the state in order to subject its intangible property within the state to taxation.'\n The tax is laid both on accounts receivable and on the amount of deposits in banks. It appears that the corporation has deposit accounts in several states. The deposits outside West Virginia were made by sending from the Wheeling office to the various banks the original checks or drafts received by the corporation from its customers. From these deposit accounts the corporation, by executive action at Wheeling, pays the amounts required for payrolls, materials, equipment, maintenance, and operating expenses as these amounts become payable in the course of its operations in Ohio and other states. Checks and drafts on these bank accounts are drawn at Wheeling, except in connection with the payment of pay rolls at certain manufacturing plants where pay-roll checks or orders are drawn against moneys sent to banks at such points for that express purpose and for meeting incidental items. The agreed statement shows that: 'All moneys are controlled and the expenditures directed by the Wheeling office, and if the immediate expenditure be \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 214]\n\u00a0\n made elsewhere, such immediate expenditure is made only under specific or general direction and control of the Wheeling office.' The so-called 'money in bank' is not cash or physical property of the corporation but is an indebtedness owing by the bank to the corporation by virtue of the deposit account. From the Wheeling office proceed the items deposited and there the withdrawals are directed and controlled. In the light of this course of business as shown by the agreed statements of fact, we find no sufficient basis for concluding that the bank accounts thus maintained and controlled were properly attributable to the corporation at any place other than at its general office at Wheeling. If there were any special circumstances by which any of these deposits could be deemed to have been localized elsewhere, they do not appear upon the present record.\n The state court permitted the deduction of the amount of the intangible property of the corporation which had been assessed in Ohio. That assessment, according to the agreed statement, was 'on accounts and notes receivable.' Counsel for the state, while insisting that the record does not show a taxable situs in Ohio of any of appellant's accounts receivable, has not taken a cross appeal or sought to assign error with respect to this part of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals. The state is not in a position to complain of the deduction and no question as to its propriety is before us upon this record. Appellant urges that in Ohio 'only the excess of receivables and prepaid items over current payables' is actually taxed, and that the deduction of 'current indebtcdness' accounts for the amount of the Ohio assessment. The inference is sought to be drawn that the amount of accounts receivable taken into consideration in Ohio was thus larger than the amount assessed. We find no basis for a conclusion whether, or to what extent, deductions were allowed in Ohio. The stipulation states \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 215]\n\u00a0\n that the appellant had been assessed 'on accounts and notes receivable' in the amount which the state court of West Virginia has allowed. Upon this record the question before us is with regard to the constitutional validity of the tax as assessed in West Virginia and not as to the amount or validity of any tax assessed elsewhere.\n Further, we find no ground for appellant's contention that the statutes of West Virginia, under which the tax is laid, are invalid in the view that they require the taxation of all the intangibles of a foreign corporation doing business within the state, regardless of the place where such intangibles may properly be the subject of taxation. We think the argument is sufficiently met by the construction placed upon these statutes by the state court. It held that the legislature intended to limit the assessment to property which was liable to taxation according to the facts and the applicable principles of law. Nor would this inquiry of the state officials into the facts involve, as contended, any delegation of authority of which complaint could be made under the Federal Constitution. The taxing officials would apply the law to the facts of the case subject to review by the courts of the state and ultimately by this Court so far as any federal question might be involved.\n Our conclusion is that appellant has failed to show that West Virginia in laying the tax has transcended the limits of its jurisdiction and thus deprived appellant of its property without due process of law.\n Fourth. Appellant also contests the tax upon the ground that equal protection of the laws has been denied. The argument is that the statutes, as construed, require that the total intangibles of appellant are to be reported and assessed, except that portion taxed in other states, and hence that the statutes discriminate unlawfully against business corporations and in favor of natural persons. Appellant also urges discrimination on the \n\n[298 U.S. 193, 216]\n\u00a0\n basis of a comparison with the provisions for the taxati n of the property of railroads and other public utilities. Counsel for the state presents an analysis of the state statutes and insists that there is no discrimination between the assessment of the intangibles of corporations, either foreign or domestic, and of those of natural persons, or with respect to the assessment of corporations engaged in public service.\n The contention of appellant is that we should deduce the protested discrimination from the face of the respective statutes. But we do not find that their provisions required the asserted construction and we have not been advised of decisions of the state court placing such a construction upon them. The decision in the instant case, as we have seen, is not that the statutes require taxation in West Virginia of all of the intangibles of appellant, without due regard to the place where they may properly be deemed to be localized, but only of such intangibles as upon the facts and the law, according to the course of business, may be deemed to be within the jurisdiction of the state. The record discloses no discrimination of which appellant is entitled to complain.\n The judgment of the state court is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 299 U.S. --, 57 S.Ct. 4, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The statutes to which appellant refers are: Code of West Virginia, chapter 11, article 3, sections 12, 13, 15, article 5, section 1, article 6, section 2, article 12, section 71; chapter 31, article 1, section 79. \n\n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWHITFIELD v.

Bricker, of Columbus, Ohio, and Alfred Clum, of Cleveland, Ohio, for State of Ohio.\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 431, 434]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was charged in the municipal court of Cleveland with a violation of section 2228-1 of the Ohio General Code, adopted March 23, 1933, which provides: 'After January 19, 1934, no goods, wares or merchandise, manufactured or mined wholly or in part in any other state by convicts or prisoners, except convicts or prisoners on parole or probation, shall be sold on the open market in this state.' By section 2228-2, a violation of this provision subjects the offender to a fine of not less than $25 nor more than $50 for the first offense. An Act of Congress passed January 19, 1929 (effective five years later), c. 79,  1, 2, 45 Stat. 1084, title 49 U.S.C.  60 (49 U.S.C.A.  60), commonly called the Hawes-Cooper Act, provides that 'All goods, wares, and merchandise manufactured, produced, or mined, wholly or in part, by convicts or prisoners, except convicts or prisoners on parole or probation, or in any penal and\/or reformatory institutions, except commodities manufactured in Federal penal and correctional institutions for use by the Federal Government, transported into any State or Territory of the United States and remaining therein for use, consumption, sale, or storage, shall upon arrival and delivery in such State or Territory be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such State or Territory to the same extent and in the same manner as though such goods, wares, and merchandise had been manufactured, produced, or mined in such State or Territory, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced in the original package or otherwise.'\n The information contains two counts. The first count charges that petitioner, upon a day named, and within the city of Cleveland, Ohio, 'did unlawfully sell on the \n\n[297 U.S. 431, 435]\n\u00a0\n open market certain goods, wares or merchandise, to-wit: one dozen Chambray men's work shirts, which said merchandise was manufactured in whole or in part by convicts or prisoners at Wetumpka Prison in the State of Alabama; said prisoners so manufacturing said articles at the time of manufacturing same not being on parole or probation.' By the second count it is charged that petitioner 'did unlawfully sell for shipment to R. C. Kissack, via railway express from Wetumpka Prison in the State of Alabama to R. C. Kissack in the City of Lakewood, Ohio, ... six dozen Chambray men's work shirts,' manufactured by convicts or prisoners at the same prison in Alabama. The case was tried before the court upon a stipulation of facts substantially the same as those set forth in the information, with the addition, in respect of the first count, that the goods were sold in the original package as shipped by interstate commerce into the state of Ohio, and that there is nothing harmful, injurious, or deleterious about the goods sold; that the six dozen shirts mentioned in the second count were not delivered to Kissack at the time of sale, but were to be shipped to his residence in Lakewood, Ohio, by railway express from the prison in Alabama.\n The case was tried without a jury. The court found petitioner guilty upon both counts, and sentenced him to pay a fine of $25 and costs.\n An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals of Ohio, Eighth District, Cuyahoga County, where the judgment was affirmed. 49 Ohio App. 530, 197 N. E. 605. A petition in error to the Supreme Court of Ohio was dismissed by that court on the ground that no debatable constitutional question was involved. 129 Ohio St. 543, 196 N.E. 164. This court granted certiorari, \n296 \nU.S. 561\n, 56 S.Ct. 141.\n Petitioner assails the constitutional validity of the Ohio statute and also of the Hawes-Cooper Act. The record fails to show that the points made by petitioner \n\n[297 U.S. 431, 436]\n\u00a0\n in this court were properly raised in the trial court. But it sufficiently appears from the opinion of the appellate court that that court considered and passed upon the following contentions: that the Ohio statute abridged the privileges and immunities of petitioner as a citizen of the United States in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, by depriving him of the privilege of selling goods, manufactured in Alabama by prison labor, in competition with citizens of Ohio engaged in selling like goods; that the Ohio statute constituted an unauthorized regulation of and a burden upon interstate commerce; and that the Hawes-Cooper Act constituted an unlawful delegation of the power of Congress to the states. These questions, therefore, are properly here for consideration. Home Ins. Co. v. Dick, \n281 U.S. 397\n, 405-407, 50 S.Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701; Erie Railroad Co. v. Purdy, \n185 \nU.S. 148, 153\n, 22 S.Ct. 605.\n The policy of the state of Ohio for many years, as evidenced by its Constitution and laws, has been to protect the products of free labor against competition from similar products brought into existence by prison labor. A section of the state constitution (article 2,  41), adopted in 1912, provides: 'Laws shall be passed providing for the occupation and employment of prisoners sentenced to the several penal institutions and reformatories in the state; ... and goods made by persons under sentence to any penal institution or reformatory without the State of Ohio, and such goods made within the State of Ohio, excepting those disposed of to the state or any political sub-division thereof or to any public institution owned, managed or controlled by the state or any political sub- division thereof, shall not be sold within this state unless the same are conspicuously marked 'prison made.' Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the passage of laws providing that convicts may work for, and that the prod- \n\n[297 U.S. 431, 437]\n\u00a0\n ucts of their labor may by disposed of to, the state or any political sub- division thereof, or for or to any public institution owned or managed and controlled by the state or any political sub-division thereof.'\n\n 1. \nThe court below proceeded upon the assumption that petitioner was a citizen of the United States; and his status in that regard is not questioned. The effect of the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as applied to the facts of the present case, is to deny the power of Ohio to impose restraints upon citizens of the United States resident in Alabama in respect of the disposition of goods within Ohio, if like restraints are not imposed upon citizens resident in Ohio. The effect of the similar clause found in the Fourth Ar icle of the Constitution (section 2), as applied to these facts, would be the same, since that clause is directed against discrimination by a state in favor of its own citizens and against the citizens of other states. The Slaughter House Case (Live-Stock Dealers ' & Butchers' Ass'n v. Crescent City Live-Stock Landing & Slaughter-House Co.), Fed.Cas. No. 8,408, 1 Woods 21, 28; Bradwell v. State of Illinois, 16 Wall. 130, 138. As interpreted by the court below, the laws of Ohio passed in pursuance of the State Constitution prohibit the sale in the open market of goods made in Ohio by convict labor. The statutory provision here challenged enforces, without discrimination, the same rule as to the convictmade goods of other states when they are brought into Ohio; and the contention in respect of the privileges and immunities clause must be rejected as without substance. Compare Scott v. Donald, \n165 \nU.S. 58, 100\n, 17 S.Ct. 265; Colgate v. Harvey (December 16, 1935) \n296 \nU.S. 404\n, 56 S.Ct. 252.\n\n 2. \nA serious question as to the infringement of the commerce clause of the Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3) is presented by the second count of the information. That count alleges that the prison-made goods described were sold to a purchaser in Ohio for shipment via railway express from a prison in Alabama. Whether the court below intended to sustain this count is not clear; but the state confines its \n\n[297 U.S. 431, 438]\n\u00a0\n argument here to a defense of its asserted power to prohibit and penalize the sale of such goods upon the open market and the statute apparently goes no further than this. In any event, for present purposes, we lay that count out of the case, and limit our consideration to the first count. True, the petitioner was found guilty upon both counts, but the penalty imposed upon him does not exceed that which might have been exacted under the first count if it had stood alone. The case, therefore, falls within the rule, frequently stated by this court, that a judgment upon an indictment containing several counts, with a verdict of guilty upon each, will be sustained if any count is good, and sufficient in itself to support the judgment. Claassen v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 140, 146\n, 12 S. Ct. 169; Evans v. United States, \n153 \nU.S. 584, 595\n, 14 S.Ct. 934; Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616, 619\n, 40 S.Ct. 17; Brooks v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 432, 441\n, 45 S.Ct. 345, 37 A.L.R. 1407\n\n\n The first count simply charges, in the terms of the statute, that petitioner unlawfully sold on the open market in Ohio certain goods made by prison labor in Alabama. These goods, according to the stipulation of facts, were sold in original packages as they were shipped in interstate commerce into Ohio. When the goods were sold, their transportation had come to an end; and the regulative power of the state had attached, except so far as that power might be affected by the fact that the packages were still unbroken. But any restrictive influence which that fact otherwise might have had upon the state power was completely removed by Congress, if the Hawes-Cooper Act by valid. That act is in substance the same as the Wilson Act with respect to intoxicating liquors, passed August 8, 1890, c. 728, 26 Stat. 313 (27 U.S.C.A.  121), as construed and upheld by this court. Rhodes v. Iowa, \n170 U.S. 412\n, 421-423, 426, 18 S.Ct. 664; In re Rahrer, \n140 U.S. 545\n, 559-560, 562, 564, 11 S.Ct. 865. In effect, both acts provide (the one as construed and the other in terms) that the subject-matter of the in- \n\n[297 U.S. 431, 439]\n\u00a0\n terstate shipment shall, upon arrival and delivery in any state or territory, become subject to the operation of the local laws as though produced in such state or territory; and shall not be exempt therefrom because introduced in original packages. Each statute simply permits the jurisdiction of the state to attach immediately upon delivery, whether the importation remain in the riginal package or not. In other words, the importation is relieved from the operation of any rule which recognizes a right of sale in the unbroken package without state interference-a right the exercise of which never has been regarded as a fundamental part of the interstate transaction, but only as an incident resulting therefrom. Rhodes v. Iowa, supra, \n170 U.S. 412\n, at pages 420, 423, 424, 18 S.Ct. 664. The interstate transaction in its fundamental aspect ends upon delivery to the consignee.\n The view of the state of Ohio that the sale of convict-made goods in competition with the products of free labor is an evil, finds ample support in fact and in the similar legislation of a preponderant number of the other states. Acts of Congress relating to the subject also recognize the evil. In addition to the Hawes-Cooper Act, the importation of the products of convict labor has been denied the right of entry at the ports of the United States and the importation prohibited. Chapter 497,  307, 46 Stat. 689, title 19 U.S.C. (1934 Ed.),  1307 (19 U.S.C.A.  1307). And the sale to the public in competition with private enterprise of goods made by convicts imprisoned under federal law is forbidden. Chapter 340,  3, 46 Stat. 391, title 18 U.S.C. (1934 Ed.),  744c (18 U.S.C.A.  744c).\n All such legislation, state and federal, proceeds upon the view that free labor, properly compensated, cannot compete successfully with the enforced and unpaid or underpaid convict labor of the prison. A state basing its legislation upon that conception has the right and power, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, by nondiscriminating legislation, to preserve its policy \n\n[297 U.S. 431, 440]\n\u00a0\n from impairment or defeat, by any means appropriate to the end and not inconsistent with that instrument The proposition is not contested that the Ohio statute would be unassailable if made to take effect after a sale in the original package. And the statute as it now reads is equally unassailable, since Congress has provided that the particular subjects of interstate commerce here involved 'shall be governed by a rule which divests them of that character at an earlier period of time than would otherwise be the case,' In re Rahrer, supra, \n140 U.S. 545\n, at page 562, 11 S.Ct. 865, 869, namely upon arrival and delivery.\n If the power of Congress to remove the impediment to state control presented by the unbroken-package doctrine be limited in any way (a question which we do not now find it necessary to consider), it is clear that the removal of that impediment in the case of prison-made goods must be upheld for reasons akin to those which moved this court to sustain the validity of the Wilson Act. Even without such action by Congress the unbroken-package doctrine, as applied to interstate commerce, has come to be regarded, generally at least, as more artificial than sound. Indeed, in its relation to that commerce, it was definitely rejected in Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506, 508\n, 509 S., 43 S.Ct. 643, 644, as affording no immunity from state taxation. 'The interstate transportation,' this court there concluded, 'was at an end, and, whether in the original packages or not, a state tax upon the oil as property or upon its sale in the state, if the state law levied the same tax on all oil or all sales of it, without regard to origin, would be neither a regulation nor a burden of the interstate commerce of which this oil had been the subject.'\n Whether that view of the doctrine as applied to state taxation should now be given a more general application, the Hawes-Cooper Act, being determinative of the case now under review, makes it unnecessary for us to decide. \n\n[297 U.S. 431, 441]\n\u00a0\n 3. That the Hawes-Cooper Act does not constitute a delegation of Congressional power to the states is made clear by In re Rahrer, supra, \n140 U.S. 545\n, at pages 560, 561, 11 S.Ct. 865, and by what we have already said under sub-division 2.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. J stice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice STONE concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWINE RY.

April 25, 1923, petitioner, appliance company, by counterclaim, charged that respondent had infringed its patents and asked for damages. The district court dismissed both bill and counterclaim. The Circuit Court of Appeals held one of \n\n[297 U.S. 387, 392]\n\u00a0\n petitioner's patents valid and infringed and remanded the cause for an accounting.\n The master reported (June 17, 1932) that profits amounting to $18,002. 83 had been realized on the infringing device, and recommended judgment for that sum. Of this total he attributed $5,490.77 to the period preceding the filing of the counterclaim and $12,512.06 t the subsequent one. The district court approved; but the Circuit Court of Appeals, after citing many conflicting opinions by other federal courts, held no recovery could be had for anything done prior to the counterclaim. This ruling is challenged. To determine the issue, we must construe section, 4900, R.S., U.S.C.A., title 35,  49, which provides:\n'It shall be the duty of all patentees, and their assigns and legal representatives, and of all persons making or vending any patented article for or under them, to give sufficient notice to the public that the same is patented; either by fixing thereon the word 'patented,' together with the day and year the patent was granted; or when, from the character of the article, this can not be done, by fixing to it, or to the package wherein one or more of them is inclosed, a label containing the like notice; and in any suit for infringement, by the party failing so to makr, no damages shall be recovered by the plaintiff, except on proof that the defendant was duly notified of the infringement, and continued, after such notice, to make, use, or vend the article so patented.'\n\n This section derives verbatim from section 38 of 'An Act to revise, consolidate, and amend the Statutes relating to Patents and Copyrights,' approved July 8, 1870, c. 230, 16 Stat. 198, 203, and has remained in force without change, presently important. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[297 U.S. 387, 393]\n\u00a0\n Section 4901, R.S., U.S.C.A., title 35,  50,2 penalizes the use of unauthorized marks upon manufactured articles 'for the purpose of deceiving the public.' Section 4919, R.S., and section 4921, as amended, U. S.C.A., title 35,  67 and 70, permit recovery of damages for infringement of any patent.\n The parties agree that issuance of a patent and recordation in the Patent Office constitute notice to the world of its existence. Boyden v. Burke, 14 How. 575, 582; Sessions v. Romadka, \n145 \nU.S. 29, 50\n, 12 S.Ct. 799.\n Neither petitioner nor another with its consent has ever manufactured or vended an article under the infringed patent. No actual notice of infringement was given respondent prior to the counterclaim.\n Counsel for petitioner affirm that under section 4900, whenever a patented article is made or vended by one of those therein specified, it becomes his duty to give sufficient notice to the public 'that the same is patented' either by placing thereon or upon the label the word 'Pate ted.' Also that, as penalty for failure therein, the defaulter is \n\n[297 U.S. 387, 394]\n\u00a0\n deprived of the right to recover damages for infringement, except upon proof that, after notice, the defendant continued to make, use, or vend. This construction, it is said, correctly we think, gives effect to every word in the section and carries out the legislative purpose.\n Counsel for respondent submit:\n Section 4900 requires a patentee or patent owner, whether or not he makes or vends, to give notice in one of the two alternative methods ( marking the article, or giving actual notice to the defendant), as therein specified. By plain language, the duty to give notice of infringement is imposed without limitation upon 'all patentees, and their assigns and legal representatives.' Then the statute proceeds and imposes this upon 'all persons making or vending any patented article for or under them.' The duty to give notice is required, not only of patentees and their assigns and legal representatives, but also the duty is imposed upon all persons making or vending under them. The purpose, is, not that notice may be given of the issuance and existence of a patent, but to prevent innocent infringement; and this is accomplished in two ways-by marking the article, if made, for all to see; or by sending an accusing notice. The section clearly does say that the three classes of persons named therein, ( 1) patentees, (2) assigns and legal representatives, and (3) all persons making or vending patented articles for or under them, must either mark the article of the patent in accordance with the statute or give notice to the accused infringer. Alternative methods of giving notice are provided by the statute; so no hardship is worked upon him who does not make and sell and no lack of harmony with other provisions of the patent laws exists. If the present edition of the statute means that giving notice is imposed only on those who make or sell, there would have been no necessity for changing the earlier enactments of the statute. The \n\n[297 U.S. 387, 395]\n\u00a0\n whole matter could have been disposed of by saying 'all persons who make or vend patented articles.'\n Obviously, but not section 4900, a patentee might recover for all damages suffered through infringement without giving prior actual notice to the infringer. That section subtracts something and creates an exception.\n If respondent's position is correct, process patents and patents under which nothing has been manufactured may be secretly infringed with impunity, notwithstanding injury to owners guilty of no neglect. Only plain language could convince us of such an intent.\n The idea of a tangible article proclaiming its own character runs through this and related provisions. Two kinds of notice are specified-one to the public by a visible mark, another by actual advice to the infringer. The second becomes necessary only when the first has not been given; and the first can only be given in connection with some fabricated article. Penalty for failure implies opportunity to perform.\n If the word 'patentees' is not qualified by 'making or vending any patented article,' the section would seem to impose on such persons a duty to the public impossible of performance when no article is made or vended by them. Also, if these words do not qualify patentees, then the words 'same' and 'thereon' are not easily understood.\n Section 5, Act of August 29, 1842, c. 263, 5 Stat. 544, declared that it shall be an offense to place the word 'patent' or 'letters-patent' on any unpatented article with intent to deceive the public and prescribes a penalty recoverable by action.\n'Sec. 6. That all patentees and assigness of patents hereafter granted, are hereby required to stamp, engrave, or cause to be stamped or engraved, on each article vended, or offered for sale, the date of the patent; and if any person or persons, patentees or assignees, shall \n\n[297 U.S. 387, 396]\n\u00a0\n neglect to do so, he, she, or they, shall be liable to the same penalty, to be recovered and disposed of in he manner specified in the foregoing fifth section of this act.'\n\n The Act of March 2, 1861, c. 88, 12 Stat. 249, provided:\n'Sec. 13. That in all cases where an article is made or vended by any person under the protection of letters-patent, it shall be the duty of such person to give sufficient notice to the public that said article is so patented, either by fixing thereon the word patented, together with the day and year the patent was granted; or when, from the character of the article patented, that may be impracticable, by enveloping one or more of the said articles, and affixing a label to the package or otherwise attaching thereto a label on which the notice, with the date, is printed; on failure of which, in any suit for the infringement of letters-patent by the party failing so to mark the article the right to which is infringed upon, no damage shall be recovered by the plaintiff, except on proof that the defendant was duly notified of the infringement, and continued after such notice to make or vend the article patented.'\n\n Section 38 of the Act of July 8, 1870, supra, became section 4900, R. S. (35 U.S.C.A.  49). Section 39, now section 4901, R.S. (35 U.S.C.A.  50), is in the margin, \n297 \nU.S. 393\n, 56 S.Ct. p. 529.\n By the act of 1842 (the earliest here important) 'all patentees and assignees of patents' were required to mark 'each article vended, or offered for sale,' and defaulters were subjected to a money penalty. Section 6. The act of 1861 directed that 'in all cases where an article is made or vended by any person under the protection of letters-patent, it shall be the duty of such person to give sufficient notice to the public that said article is so patented,' etc. Section 13. It penalized default by taking away the right to recover damages, except, etc. The act of 1870, prepared by the \n\n[297 U.S. 387, 397]\n\u00a0\n Commissioners to Revise the Statutes (Act June 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 74),3 made it the duty of 'all patentees, and their assigns and legal representatives, and of all persons making or vending any patented article for or under them, it give sufficient notice to the public that the same is patented,' etc. (16 Stat. 203,  38) and penalized default as did the act of 1861\n\n\n All these acts reveal the purpose to require that marks be put on patented articles for the information of the public. They undertook to specify those charged with the duty to attach such marks. In this regard, the meaning of the act of 1861 is not open to question. The different language found in the act of 1870 was intended, we think, to delimit the term a 'person under the protection of letters-patent' to describe the members of the class more definitely, and not to impose a new and different burden upon non-producing patentees. We find nothing adequate to support the notion that such patentees were deprived of the right theretofore existing to claim damages from an infringer unless and until he could be run down and served with actual notice.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously sustained the respondent's position, because of the different language found in the act of 1870. It said:\n The earlier statute (section 13) provided 'that in all cases where an article is made or vended by any person under the protection of letters- patent, it shall be the duty of such person to give sufficient notice to the public that said article is so patented.' 12 Stat. 249. That statute required any person making or vending an article under the protection of letters patent to give the notice, whereas the present one requires that notice be given by all patentees and their assigns and legal representatives, and also, by all persons making or vending the patented \n\n[297 U.S. 387, 398]\n\u00a0\n article. Thus under the earlier statute a patentee who did not make or vend the article was not required to give the notice, but under the present statute he patentee, his assigns and legal representatives, must give it, whether they do or do not make or vend the article. This is the only difference between the two statutes, and, in our opinion, the amendment to the old statute as embodied in the new requires the patentee or his assignee who does not make or vend the article to give notice of the patent and limits the recovery for infringement thereof to damages sustained thereafter.\n Under the interpretation which we accept, section 4900, R.S. (35 U.S. C.A.  49), provides protection against deception by unmarked patented articles, and requires nothing unreasonable of patentees. By admission, the act of 1861 did not require a patentee who did not produce to give actual notice to an infringer before damages could be recovered; and there is nothing in the language or history of the act of 1870 sufficient to indicate an intent to alter his position in this regard. This conclusion is in harmony with the language of Dunlap v. Schofield, \n152 \nU.S. 244, 247\n, 14 S.Ct. 576.\n The challenged judgment must be reversed. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act of February 7, 1927, c. 67, 44 Stat. 1058 (35 U.S.C.A.  49 ), amended section 4900, R.S. by inserting 'Provided, however, That with respect to any patent issued prior to April 1, 1927, it shall be sufficient to give such notice in the form following, viz.: 'Patented,' together with the day and year the patent was granted' immediately after the words 'like notice' and before 'and in any suit.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 4901, R.S., U.S.C.A., title 35,  50.-Every person who, in any manner, marks upon anything made, used, or sold by him for which he has not obtained a patent, the name or any imitation of the name of any person who has obtained a patent therefor without the consent of such patentee, or his assigns or legal representatives; or\n'Who, in any manner, marks upon or affixes to any such patented article the word 'patent' or 'patentee,' or the words 'letters patent,' or any word of like import, with intent to imitate or counterfeit the mark or device of the patentee, without having the license or consent of such patentee or his assigns or legal representatives; or\n\n Who, in any manner, marks upon or affixes to any unpatented article the word 'patent,' or any word importing that the same is patented, for the purpose of deceiving the public, shall be liable, for every such offense, to a penalty of not less than $100, with costs; one-half of said penalty to the person who shall sue for the same, and the other to the use of the United States, to be recovered by suit in any district court of the United States within whose jurisdiction such offense may have been committed. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Congressional Globe, vol. 43, part 5, pp. 2679-2684; Congressional Globe, vol. 43, part 5, pp. 2679-2680; Congressional Globe, vol. 43, part 5, p. 2680. \n\n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWOOLSEY v.

CENTRAL KENTUCKY NATURAL GAS CO(1936)\nNo. 551\nArgued: March 4, 1936Decided: March 16, 1936\n\n\n\n\n[297 U.S. 537, 538]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lon B. Rogers, of Lexington, Ky., for appellant.\n Messrs. D. L. Hazelrigg, of Frankfort, Ky., and Henry T. Duncan, of Lexington, Ky., for appellees.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Under an ordinance of the city of Lexington, Kentucky, adopted in January, 1927, the Central Kentucky Natural Gas Company purchased a franchise for the distribution and sale of gas to consumers in that city. The contract with the city provided that the company should promulgate the rates which it proposed to charge and that, if the city deemed them to be excessive, proceedings should be instituted before the Railroad Commission of the State in order to have just and reasonable rates prescribed. It was also stipulated that pending the proceedings before the commission, and any subsequent proceedings in court, the company should have the right to charge specified temporary rates, provided that a certain amount collected under such rates should be impounded pending the final fixation of rates, whereupon \n\n[297 U.S. 537, 539]\n\u00a0\n the sums impounded, with interest accumulations, should be distributed under the order of the commission, or of the court, to the company or to its several customers as the final determination should direct.\n The company promulgated a schedule of rates which the city assailed as excessive and a portion of the amounts collected were impounded. In 1929, the commission made an order prescribing rates and this order was attacked by the company in a suit in the District Court of the United States. By an interlocutory injunction that court enjoined further proceedings under the order and appointed as receiver the custodian of the fund which had been impounded by the commission, directing him to hold any fund required by the franchise contract to be impounded subsequently. Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, 37 F.(2d) 938. On final hearing, the court held the prescribed rate to be confiscatory, but finding that a certain higher rate would be reasonable, directed that a permanent injunction should issue restraining the imposition of the prescribed rate, upon condition that the company file its consent that the fund impounded from the rate collected in excess of that deemed by the court to be reasonable should be distributed. As the company declined so to consent, a final decree was entered denying a permanent injunction and directing the distribution of the impounded fund. 60 F.(2d) 137.\n This Court reversed the decree, holding that on the basis of the conclusion of the District Court that the rate prescribed by the commission was confiscatory, that court should have granted appropriate relief without condition, leaving the commission free to exercise its authority to fix a reasonable rate, and the court should have relinquished its control over the impounded fund by directing the receiver to retain it in his capacity as custodian appointed by the commission. Central Kentucky Natural Gas Company v. Railroad Commission, 290 U.S. 264, 273, 275, 54 S. Ct. 154. The city and the company then undertook \n\n[297 U.S. 537, 540]\n\u00a0\n to compromise their differences by agreeing upon a rate for the future and by providing for distribution of the impounded fund. The terms of the agreement were embodied in Resolution No. 74 passed by the board of commissioners of the city and accepted by the company. Pursuant to that agreement, the board of commissioners passed Ordinance No. 271 amending the existing franchise ordinance and putting into effect the agreed schedule of future rates. A petition for a referendum was filed against the la ter ordinance, whereupon the board of commissioners repealed both Ordinance No. 271 and Resolution No. 74.\n The present suit was then brought by the company against the city in the circuit court of the State for a declaration of the rights of the company and for a determination of the validity of Resolution No. 74 and Ordinance No. 271. Another suit was filed by J. M. Wright (appellant here) in the state court, setting up the adoption of the original franchise ordinance in 1927 and its acceptance by the city, and that he was a consumer of gas, and seeking a mandatory injunction directing the company to furnish gas to him at a specified rate until the proceedings before the Railroad Commission had been finally determined. The two cases were consolidated. Later, J. M. Wright and F. A. Forsythe (the other appellant here) were permitted to file an intervening petition in the company's suit against the city, setting forth their interest as consumers. The circuit court held Resolution No. 74 invalid in its entirety, because (1) it undertook to distribute, without the approval of the court, the fund in which it held the consumers had a vested right, (2) one S. B. Featherstone, who had been a party plaintiff on behalf of himself and all other consumers in earlier proceedings in the state court and before the Railroad Commission, had not agreed to the resolution, and (3) \n\n[297 U.S. 537, 541]\n\u00a0\n the city was without power to agree upon a distribution of the impounded fund and could only agree on a rate, after which the duty would devolve upon the court and the commission to distribute the fund in accordance with the rate fixed.\n That decision was reversed by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. City of Lexington, 260 Ky. 361, 85 S.W.( 2d) 870, 871. That court, after observing that it had been 'erroneously thought by numerous voters that Ordinance 271 was subject to a referendum,' reached the following conclusions: That at the time when Resolution No. 74 was passed the rate theretofore fixed by the Railroad Commission was a nullity; that the city and the company were as free to agree upon the rates to be charged under the franchise contract as they were before the void finding of the Railroad Commission was promulgated; that the consent of the court or commission required in the resolution was purely a formal consent to the method of distribution; and that there 'was no reason requiring the consent of the court or commission as to the amounts distributed.' In this view, the Court of Appeals deemed the question for its consideration to be whether or not Resolution No. 74 in effect fixed a rate. The court did not consider it necessary that Featherstone should be a party to the agreement, citing In re Engelhard & Sons, \n231 \nU.S. 646\n, 34 S.Ct. 258. 'The matter was one entirely between the gas company and the city.' The court then concluded that Resolution No. 74 'did in fact fix a reasonable rate for the period of impoundment'; that the city and the company 'had the power to deal with the situation in a practical way'; and that so long as the result of their action was to agree upon a return for the company that was neither extortionate nor confiscatory, there was no basis for objection to the method adopted. Accordingly, the court held that both Resolution No. 74 and Ordinance No. 271 were valid as contracts and could \n\n[297 U.S. 537, 542]\n\u00a0\n not be repealed as attempted, and that it was (the plain duty of the public agencies concerned to lend every effort to bring this long-pending litigation to an end.'\n The case comes here on appeal. Appellants, consumers of gas, contend that the obligations of the original franchise contract have been impaired by the attempted compromise in violation of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution (article 1,  10) and that appellants have been deprived of vested property rights in the impounded fund without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. On examining the franchise contract and the proceedings for the impounding of amounts collected from consumers (Appleby v. New York, 271 U.S 364, 380, 46 S.Ct. 569; Larson v. South Dakota, \n278 \nU.S. 429, 433\n, 49 S.Ct. 196; Abie State Bank v. Bryan, \n282 \nU.S. 765, 773\n, 51 S.Ct. 252), we find no warrant for a conclusion that appellants had any vested right which precluded the city from effecting a reasonable adjustment of the controversy over rates and from entering into a contract fixing a reasonable rate for the period during which the fund was impounded as well as for the future. Compare Violet Trapping Company, Inc. v. Grace, \n297 \nU.S. 119\n, 56 S.Ct. 386, decided February 3, 1936; Ingraham v. Hanson, \n297 \nU.S. 378\n, 56 S.Ct. 511, decided March 2, 1936. In making that settlement, as well as in the making of the original franchise contract, the consumers were represented by the city. In re Engelhard & Sons, supra. Compare Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company, \n270 \nU.S. 587, 592\n, 46 S.Ct. 408, 70.Ed. 747; Kentucky v. Indiana, \n281 \nU.S. 163, 174\n, 50 S.Ct. 275; Chicago v. Chicago Rapid Transit Company, \n284 \nU.S. 577\n, 52 S.Ct. 2.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nZIMMERN v. U.S.(1936)\nNo. 766\nArgued: Decided: April 27, 1936\n\n\n\n Mr. Lawrence Koenigsberger, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr., of Boston, Mass., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether the petitioners appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals within the time prescribed by law.\n The United States brought suit to set aside a deed by Samuel Zimmern to his wife, and another deed, in which the wife joined, to his children; a separate parcel of real estate being the subject of each. At the time of the conveyance Samuel Zimmern was indebted to the complainant for a deficiency of income taxes duly assessed against him. The deeds were attacked upon the ground that they \n\n[298 U.S. 167, 168]\n\u00a0\n had been made without consideration and with fraudulent intent. The District Court, after a trial, sustained the charge of fraud and gave judgment in favor of the complainant for the relief prayed for in the bill. Its decree, which was entered on March 3, 1934, directed a sale of the two parcels, and the payment of the proceeds to the United States to be applied upon the taxes after deducting what was due to the wife by reason of a homestead exemption allowed by the local law. Nothing was said in the decree as to the exception or reservation from the sale of her inchoate right of dower.\n The term at which the cause was tried would have expired, unless extended, on May 28, 1934. However, before that date, the judge made an order extending the term for 90 days; the order being prefaced with the following recital: 'It appearing to the court that a decree was entered in this cause on March 3rd, 1934 and for good reason shown it will be necessary to modify or amend said decree.' \n1\n No petition for rehearing in behalf of the wife, Leila Zimmern, appears in the record, nor any motion for an amendment. A petition in behalf of Samuel Zimmern does appear, but it was filed on August 11, 1934, when the time to appeal had already gone by if the original decree was then presently in force. Cf. Conboy v. First National Bank of Jersey City, \n203 \nU.S. 141, 145\n, 27 S.Ct. 50. Two \n\n[298 U.S. 167, 169]\n\u00a0\n days later the judge made an order amending the decree by directing that the sale be subject to any dower rights of the wife, and in all other respects denying whatever motions were before him. Appeals by all the defendants were taken and allowed. Under the applicable statute (28 U.S.C .  230 (28 U.S.C.A.  230 and note)), the appeals were too late if the time is to be computed from the date of the decree as originally entered. They were regular if the time is to be computed from the date of the amendment. The Court of Appeals held that what had been corrected by the amendment was an accidental slip or omission, not affecting the issues in suit (Federal Equity Rule 72, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723), and inoperative to toll the statute. Accordingly, the appeals were dismissed; two opinions being written, one upon the original hearing and the other upon rehearing. 79 F.(2d) 703; 80 F.(2d) 993. This court granted certiorari to review a ruling as to practice that might tend, if erroneous, to introduce confusion into the law. \n297 \nU.S. 701\n, 56 S.Ct. 594.\n We think the decision misapprehends the effect of the order of May 11, 1934, in which th judge who had tried the cause declared himself dissatisfied with the decree that he had made, and to give himself an opportunity to make the necessary changes extended the term then drawing to a close. He did not limit the amendment to matters of form only as distinguished from those of substance. He did not act, so far as the record shows, at the instance of the defendants, still less upon a showing of error in only one particular. He stated broadly and, for all that appears, of his own motion that changes must be made, and without a word to indicate whether he meant them to be great or little. We think the effect of that order was to suspend the operation of the decree so that no appeal could be taken from it until it had been amended or confirmed, and its vigor thus restored. Until such action had been taken, it was no longer a decree at all. The judge had plenary power while the term was in existence \n\n[298 U.S. 167, 170]\n\u00a0\n to modify his judgment for error of fact or law or even revoke it altogether. Doss v.

Finality was lacking until his choice had been announced.\n The appeals being timely, the decree which dismissed them should be reversed, and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For greater certainty the terms of the order are here stated in full:\n'It appearing to the Court that a decree was entered in this cause on March 3rd, 1934 and for good reason shown it will be necessary to modify or amend said decree,\n\n'It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged by the Court that the November Term of this Court which expires on the 28th day of May, 1934 be, and the same is, extended for ninety (90) days from that date, in which time all matters and orders in connection with this cause and the amendments of the decree may be entered.\n\n'Done this 11th day of May, A.D., 1934.\n\n'Robert T.
