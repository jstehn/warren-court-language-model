The claim is based upon an implied contract alleged to have arisen from a taking for war purposes, for such time as might be necessary, of described portions of the Bush Terminal docks and warehouses, including the claimant's pier. The Court of Claims dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction upon the ground that the facts found excluded as matter of law the possibility that a contract should be implied and that therefore there could be no claim. Hill v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 593\n, 13 S. Ct. 1011.\n Under the Act of August 29, 1916, c. 418, 39 Stat. 619, 645 (Comp. St .  1974a), giving the President authority to take possession of any system of transportation, he took possession through the Secretary of War of the Bush Terminal, in Brooklyn, New York, including Pier No. 8, the Secretary issuing a general order dated December 31, 1917, 'To whom it may concern' which stated that 'possession and control is hereby taken ... of the following described parts of a system of transportation ... that is to say of those portions of the Bush Terminal docks and warehouse property described,' etc. 'Steps will be promptly taken to ascertain the fair compensation to be paid for the temporary use by the Government of the premises.' Notice of this order was served on the Bush Terminal Company on or about January 3, 1918, and at about the same time the receiver of A. W. Duckett & Co. was notified that 'the Bush Terminal has this day been requisitioned for the use of the embarkation service of the United States Army, and possession thereof has passed to the United States' and he was directed to make arrangements for vacating the premises. As the result of conferences the United States took possession of the pier at midnight, January 31, 1918\n\n\n It is unnecessary to go into the details of what was done later, as the acts that we have stated determined the relations of the parties. On the face of those acts \n\n[266 U.S. 149, 151]\n\u00a0\n it seems to us manifest that the United States, although not taking the fee, proceeded in rem as in eminent domain, and assumed to itself by paramount authority and power the possession and control of the piers named, against all the world. Ordinarily an unqualified taking in fee by eminent domain takes all interests and as it takes the res is not called upon to specify the interests that happen to exist. Whether or not for some purposes the new takers may be given the benefit of privity with the former holders, the accurate view would seem to be that such an exercise of eminent domain founds a new title and extinguishes all previous rights. Emery v. Boston Terminal Co., 178 Mass. 172, 184, 59 N. E. 763, 86 Am. St. Rep. 473; Farnsworth v. Boston, 126 Mass. 1, 8. In such a case we no more should expect to hear it argued that leaseholds were not to be paid for than that the former fee simple should not be, on the ground that it was gone and a new fee begun. A right may be taken by simple destruction for public use. United States v. Welch, \n217 \nU.S. 333, 339\n, 30 S. Ct. 527, 28 L. R. A. (N. S.) 385, 19 Ann. Cas. 680. See Peabody v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 530, 538\n, 34 S. Ct. 159. Here the taking purported to be a taking of the Bush Terminal docks, etc.-not of the title of the Bush Terminal Company, but of the things, to whomsoever they belonged. The notice was 'to whom it may concern.' The claimant was turned out like the others. We can see no ground for attributing to the United States the extraordinary intent to recognize and pay for other interests but to exclude the claimant. The order made no such distinction but promised fair compensation, seemingly to all, and the subsequent appointment of a board of appraisers contemplated payment to tenants. Any arrangement that the Government may have made later with the owner to pay to it what might be due to the tenants or some of them did not affect the claimant's rights. \n\n[266 U.S. 149, 152]\n\u00a0\n Omnia Commercial Co., Inc., v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 502\n, 43 S. Ct. 437, which was thought to give some color to the decision below, has no bearing upon the present question. There the Government made a requisition of the entire product of a Steel Company for a year. On the assumption that the Government thereby made it impossible for the Steel Company to perform a contract to sell a large quantity of steel plate to the claimant, the decision was that nevertheless the contract was not taken. The contract was no part of the res taken and whatever might be the collateral consequences of the appropriation liability for them was not an incident of the Government's act. \n261 \nU.S. 510\n, 43 S. Ct. 437. Here the claimant's possession under its lease was a part of the res, and therefore was within the implied promise to pay. Whatever the effect of the taking there was a contract implied in fact by the President's order and there is no doubt concerning the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. United States v.

St.  8604a]) provides that a common carrier receiving property for transportation in interstate commerce 'shall issue a receipt or a bill of lading therefor,' shall be liable 'for the full actual loss, damage, or injury to such \n\n[265 U.S. 265, 266]\n\u00a0\n property [shipped] caused by it,' that 'no contract, receipt, rule, regulation, or other limitation of any character whatsoever, shall exempt such common carrier ... from the liability hereby imposed,' and that such liability for the full actual loss shall exist 'notwithstanding any limitation of liability or limitation of the amount of recovery or representation or agreement as to value in any such receipt or bill of lading, or in any contract, rule, regulation, or in any tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission; and any such limitation, without respect to the manner or form in which it is sought to be made is hereby declared to be unlawful and void.' The effect of this act is to nullify provisions limiting liability contained in public tariffs and in bills of lading. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., \n253 U.S. 97\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 504.\n While this act of Congress was in force, Darden shipped six horses by Adams Express from Latonia, Ky., to Windsor, Ontario. Five of the horses were killed in transit. He brought this action to recover their value against that company in the federal court for the Middle district of Tennessee. The jury found that the accident was due to the carrier's negligence, and rendered a verdict for Darden in the sum of $32,500. Judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 286 Fed. 61. The case was brought here by writ of error under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218). A petition for a writ of certiorari was also filed, and consideration of it was postponed. The case is properly here on writ of error. Compare Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Rice, \n247 U.S. 201\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 429. The petition for a writ of certiorari is therefore denied.\n The company contends that a verdict for it should have been directed, or that the recovery should have been limited to $500, by reason of the following facts: The tariff contained a provision requiring that the actual value of a shipment be declared; and also provided for an additional \n\n[265 U.S. 265, 267]\n\u00a0\n charged by way of a graduated percentage, if the value exceeded a stated amount. The tariff rate for shipping a carload of horses valued at $100 each was $165. This rate was named to Darden by the Express Company's agent, that amount was paid, and the company's so-called nonnegotiable live stock contract, prepared by it, recited that the value of the horses were declared by the shipper to be $100 each. The horses were in fact race horses, and were of much greater value than the sum named. This fact was known to the company's agent. The copy of the shipping contract stating $ 100 to be the declared value of each horse was not seen by Darden until after the accident had occurred. It was not contended that he was guilty of actual fraud in shipping at the rate named.\n The main argument for the company appears to be this: The statute requires the shipper to disclose the 'real value' of the shipment, and requires the carrier to collect the 'real value' rate. Darden paid the rate which, by the tariff, was made applicable only to horses valued at not more than $100 each. The shipping contract recited that the declared value of each horse was $100. To that contract was attached a notice that the shipper 'must state the actual value of the shipment, which value must be inserted in the contract.' The form of this contract and notice were filed as part of the tariff. Darden was bound to know the provisions of the tariff. To recover he must sue on the shipping contract. By claiming actual value largely in excess of $100, with a view to establish liability therefor, he attempted not only to vary a written contract, but to secure, by means of a discriminatory rate, an illegal rebate. Thereby he necessarily disclosed to the courts his unlawful conduct, and the court should refuse its aid, whether the action be deemed one upon an illegal contract or, more generally, a proceeding to enforce rights arising out of an illegal transaction. \n\n[265 U.S. 265, 268]\n\u00a0\n The short answer to this, and to the company's other arguments, is furnished by the comprehensive terms of the statute. From them appears the intention of Congress to make the carrier liable for the full actual loss, regardless of any agreement or representation of the shipper. Its purpose is so accurately stated that discussion could not make it clearer. It might confuse. The enactment of the second Cummins Amendment, in the following year (Act of August 9, 1916, c. 301, 39 Stat. 441 [Comp. St.  8604a]), indicates merely that the provisions of the 1915 act proved to be mroe comprehensive than was found to be desirable. \n1\n Compare American Railway Express Co. v.

DUNKEN(1924)\nNo. 62\nArgued: Decided: December 15, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 389, 390]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. J. Moroney, of Dallas, Tex., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. C. A. Boynton, W. E. Spell, and J. A. Stanford, all of Waco, Tex., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by the defendant in error upon a policy of insurance issued by the insurance company on the life of W. J. Dunken. The insurance company is a Connecticut corporation. When it issued the policy it was doing business in Texas under the laws of that state, of which Dunken then was a citizen and inhabitant.\n The Texas statute provides:\n'Any contract of insurance payable to any citizen or inhabitant of this state by any insurance company or corporation \n\n[266 U.S. 389, 391]\n\u00a0\n doing business within this state shall be held to be a contract made and entered into under and by virtue of the laws of this state relating to insurance, and governed thereby, notwithstanding such policy or contract of insurance may provide that the contract was executed, and the premiums and policy (in case it becomes a demand) should be payable without this state, or at the home office of the company or corporation issuing the same.' Article 4950, Rev. Civ. Stats. 1911\n\n\n\n The statute further provides that where loss occurs failure to make payment within 30 days after demand shall render the company liable to pay the holder of the policy in addition to the amount of loss twelve per cent. damages on the amount of such loss, together with reasonable attorney fees for the prosecution and collection thereof. Article 4746.\n These provisions, together with others, are declared to be conditions upon which foreign insurance companies shall be permitted to do business within the state and any such corporation engaged in issuing insurance policies within the state is deemed to have assented thereto as a condition precedent to the right to engage in such business. Article 4972.\n The policy in question was issued under the following circumstances: On December 17, 1910, H. D. Alexander, manager for the insurance company in the state of Tennessee, took the application of Dunken, then a resident of Tennessee, for a seven-year term policy. The policy was duly issued in Connecticut and delivered in Tennessee to Dunken. By its terms, at the sole option of the insured, upon any anniversary of its date, without medical re-examination, it was convertible, among other forms of insurance, into a 20-payment life commercial policy, bearing the same date and issued at the same age, on payment of the difference between the premiums already paid and those required under the converted policy. On February \n\n[266 U.S. 389, 392]\n\u00a0\n 19, 1916, the seven-year policy still being in force, Dunken, in the meantime having moved to Texas, exercised his option and applied to the company for a conversion 'in accordance with the conditions' of that policy just stated. His application stipulated that the statements and answers in the original application for the seven-year term policy should be the basis of the new policy and form a part of the same. The application was mailed to the Tennessee manager and by him forwarded to the home office of the company in Connecticut. There the old policy was canceled, stamped 'Surrendered; new number, 152,755; $10,000,' and a 20 payment life commercial policy, bearing the new number and conforming to the express terms of the agreement in the original policy, was issued and forwarded to Alexander in Tennessee for delivery. Alexander sent the policy by mail to Dunken at Waco, Texas, together with a loan note and a form authorizing the company to deduct the 1916 premium from the proceeds of the loan to be signed by him and returned. Dunken received these documents in due course of mail and retained the policy, but did not answer Alexander's letter, pay the premiums or execute the loan papers. Three months later he died. In the letter transmitting the policy Alexander fixed no time for the execution and return of the loan note and authority to deduct the 1916 premium; nor did he suggest that the delivery of the policy was in any way qualified. There was no further correspondence or notice of any kind from the company. It was agreed that the demand required by article 4746 of the Texas statute, heretofore cited, was made by defendant in error. Judgment was rendered against the company for the amount of the policy less certain offsets, together with the statutory penalty of 12 per cent. and an attorney's fee of $3,000, which judgment was duly affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals. 248 S. W. 165. The Supreme Court of the state having dismissed an application \n\n[266 U.S. 389, 393]\n\u00a0\n for a writ of error for want of jurisdiction, the writ of error here was issued to the intermediate court. Randall v. Commissioners, \n261 \nU.S. 252\n, 43 S. Ct. 252.\n The judgment below is challenged upon these grounds: (1) The policy as shown by the undisputed evidence never became a completed or binding contract; (2) it was a Tennessee or Connecticut contract, and, since under the laws of those states no penalty or attorney's fee was recoverable, the Texas statute, as construed and applied, violates the contract impairment clause, the full faith and credit clause, and the several clauses of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution; and (3) assuming it to be a Texas contract, plaintiff having demanded and sued for substantially more than she recovered, the suit was rightfully defended and the statute as construed and applied to that situation violates the same provisions of the federal Constitution.\n Defendant in error moves to dismiss the writ of error or affirm the judgment of the state court upon the ground that the asserted federal questions are so lacking in substance as to be frivolous. This motion must be denied. Other matters aside, the contention that the contract is controlled by the law of Tennessee or Connecticut-in which event the Texas statute in respect of penalty and attorney's fee as construed and applied, is unconstitutional-clearly presents a substantial question under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 \nU.S. 531, 540\n, 541 S., 35 S. Ct. 724, L. R. A. 1916A, 771. See, also, New York Life Ins. Co. v. Head, \n234 \nU.S. 149, 159\n, 160 S., 34 S. Ct. 879. And the cause is properly here on writ of error, under section 237 of the Judicial cial Code, as amended September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214). Kans. City So. Ry. v. Road Imp. Dist. No. 6, \n256 \nU.S. 658\n, 41 S. Ct. 604.\n First. Coming then to the merits, the first contention to be considered presents a pure question of fact, which \n\n[266 U.S. 389, 394]\n\u00a0\n was decided against plaintiffs in error by the jury in response to specially submitted issues. Upon these issues the jury found that the new policy was delivered by an agent of the insurance company as a completed contract with the intention that it should become effective and binding from the time of its receipt by Dunken, and that such delivery as a completed contract was acquiesced in by an executive officer of the company. This verdict met with the concurrence of the trial court, and after a full review of the evidence, of the appellate court. The rule is settled that the decision of a state court upon a question of fact ordinarily cannot be made the subject of inquiry here. See for example, Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Haber, \n169 \nU.S. 613, 639\n, 18 S. Ct. 488; Smiley v. Kansas, \n196 \nU.S. 447, 453\n, 454 S., 25 S. Ct. 289. To this general rule there are two equally well settled exceptions:\n'(1) Where a federal right has been denied as the result of a finding shown by the record to be without evidence to support it, and (2) where a conclusion of law as to a federal right and findings of fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary, in order to pass upon the federal question, to analyze the facts.' Nor. Pac. Ry. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 593\n, 35 S. Ct. 429, 432 (59 L. Ed. 735, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1), and cases cited.\n\n See, also, Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 324\n, 325 S., 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375.\n This case comes within the general rule and not within either of the exceptions. The fact decided is that the policy sued upon was delivered as a completed and binding contract. The federal question presented arises from the ruling of the court that the Texas and not the Tennessee statute controls this contract. The asserted federal right was not denied as a result of the finding of fact; nor are the conclusion in respect of the federal right and the finding interdependent or so intermingled as to cause it to be necessary to consider the latter in order to pass upon the former. That the contract was effective is a fact equally consistent with the determination of the federal question either way. \n\n[266 U.S. 389, 395]\n\u00a0\n Second. The argument that the policy was not a Texas contract proceeds upon two grounds: (a) That the converted policy became effective, if it ever did, when it was mailed by the company's agent in Tennessee; (b) that the original policy was clearly a Tennessee or Connecticut contract, and the converted policy, being executed under the optional privilege granted by the original contract and in exact compliance with its terms, is a subsidiary and not an independent agreement, and the rights and obligations of the parties are controlled by the law of the original contract.\n We proceed at once to the consideration of the second ground, since if that is well founded it will be unnecessary to consider the first. Whether a subsequent contract made in pursuance of the provisions of an earlier one is to be regarded as separate, detached and independent, or as a continuation and in effect the same, is a matter not always free from difficulty. The question as applied to substituted policies of insurance has not heretofore arisen in this court and apparently has seldom arisen in the state courts. In Dannhauser v. Wallenstein, 169 N. Y. 199, 208, 62 N. E. 160, 162, where a 10-payment life policy provided that after the payment of two or more equal premiums, notwithstanding default in payment of subsequent premiums, the company would grant a paid-up policy for a proportionate part of the original amount of the policy, it was held that such paid-up policy when issued was not an independent contract. The court said:\n'It was simply a continuation of the original contract under the option which gave the holder thereof the right, after two or more annual premiums had been paid, to cease paying the annual premiums and take a paid-up policy in exchange for the first one. It was a change in the mere form of the contract expressly provided for by its own terms. It is true that the first policy, the original evidence of the contract between the insured and the company, \n\n[266 U.S. 389, 396]\n\u00a0\n was 'surrendered to the company and canceled' when the paid-up policy was issued, but this was simply a part of, and in compliance with, the terms of the original contract. The contract was continued as it provided that it might be, in the form of a paid-up policy, such as was accepted by the defendant. It was not a modification, but a fulfillment of the original contract.\n\n The facts were held to justify an opposite conclusion in Gans v. AEtna Life Ins. Co., 214 N. Y. 326, 108 N. E. 443, L. R. A. 1915F, 703. There the original policy contained a provision to the effect that if the insured should commit suicide within one year from the date thereof the policy should be void. It allowed, among other options, an exchange for another policy bearing the same date upon payment of a sum equal to the difference between the premiums actually paid and those which would have been earned by the substituted policy. The substituted policy, however, bore the date of its issue and by its terms the suicide provision ran for 'one year from the date hereof.' It was contended that, since the assured might have exercised his option so as to have made the date of the original policy the date of the substituted policy, the option actually exercised should be construed to that effect. But the court replied that, the parties having agreed that the date of the new policy should be that of its issue and so made it, and the premium payable being adapted to the kind of policy selected and to the then insuring age of the assured, it must be held to be an independent contract to be construed without reference to the options not exercised.\n Under different circumstances the same question came before the Supreme Court of Tennessee, in Silliman v. International Life Ins. Co., 131 Tenn. 303, 174 S. W. 1131, L. R. A. 1915F, 707. There a five-year term policy provided that the insured might at any premium date exchange it for any form of policy then in use at the premium fixed by his age at the time of the exchange or at the age in the original policy by paying the \n\n[266 U.S. 389, 397]\n\u00a0\n difference in premiums, etc. The policy contained a provision to the effect that in case of suicide within one year from its date the company should be liable only for the amount of the premiums paid. Four years later the insured demanded another form of policy and the exchange was made on the old application and medical examination, the terms of the second policy being in strict accord with the obligations of the first policy. The new policy limited the right of recovery in case of suicide 'within one year from the date on which this insurance begins.' Six months after the change of policies, insured committed suicide. The Tennessee court held that the two policies were in effect one and the same contract, and that the insurance began within the meaning of the suicide clause in the second policy at the time the first policy was issued, since the dominant purpose of the parties was to carry out the provisions of the contract contained in that policy. That time having run before the exchange, the clause was rejected as surplusage. The Gans Case, was distinguished upon several grounds, and especially upon the ground that there was nothing to show that the second Tennessee policy was an independent, complete and isolated contract, unconnected with the first policy; but on the contrary that it was expressly shown that they were connected, 'and that the second was issued because of and in compliance with the requirements of the first.' See, also, McDonnell v. Alabama Gold Life Ins. Co., 85 Ala. 401, 412-415, 5 So. 120; People v. Globe Mutual Life Ins. Co., 15 Abb. N. C. (N. Y.) 75; Barry v. Brune et al., 71 N. Y. 261, 268.\n While this court has not passed upon the precise question here presented, it had before it an analogous question in New York Life Ins. Co. v. Dodge, \n246 \nU.S. 357\n, 38 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 593, and Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Liebing, \n259 \nU.S. 209\n, 42 S. Ct. 467. The Dodge Case dealt with an insurance policy issued in Missouri to a resident and citizen of Missouri by a New York corporation with a Missouri license. The policy provided \n\n[266 U.S. 389, 398]\n\u00a0\n that 'cash loans can be obtained by the insured on the sole security of this policy on demand at any time after this policy has been in force two full years,' etc. It was provided that application for any loan should be in writing and that the loan would be subject to the terms of the company's loan agreement. Under this provision the insured procured a loan at the home office of the company in New York City, hypothecating the policy there as security. The loan agreement declared that it was made and to be performed in New York and under and pursuant to the laws of that state. Upon failure of the insured to pay a premium the entire reserve of the policy was applied to satisfy the loan and thereupon all obligation ceased under the provisions of New York law. The insured having died, suit was brought by the beneficiary upon the policy in reliance upon the Missouri nonforfeiture statute (Rev. Stats. 1899,  7897), by the terms of which, unlike the New York statute, the insurance would have continued in force. This court held that while the policy was clearly a Missouri contract the loan agreement was an independent contract made in New York and subject to New York law. In the course of the opinion it is said (page 373 [38 S. Ct. 339]):\n'It should be noted that the clause in the policy providing 'cash loans can be obtained by the insured on the sole security of this policy on demand, etc.,' certainly imposed no obligation upon the company to make such a loan if the Missouri statute applied and inhibited valid hypothecation of the reserve as security therefor as defendant in error maintains. She cannot, therefore, claim anything upon the theory that the loan contract actually consummated was one which the company had legally obligated itself to make upon demand.'\n\n The decision proceeds upon the theory that the provision in respect of loans did not constitute an absolute promise to make a loan upon simple demand at all events, \n\n[266 U.S. 389, 399]\n\u00a0\n and that the loan contract was an independent, subsequent agreement made in another state. In the Liebing Case, subsequently decided, the policy executed in Missouri provided that 'the company will ... loan amounts within the limits of the cash surrender value,' etc., and this court, pointing out that the language of the policy in the Dodge Case was 'cash loans can be obtained, etc.,' said (pages 213, 214 [42 S. Ct. 468]):\n'The policy now sued upon contained a positive promise to make the loan if asked, whereas in the one last mentioned [the Dodge Case] it might be held that some discretion was reserved to the company.'\n\n In the light of these decisions, then, we inquire whether the second policy issued to Dunken is to be controlled by Tennessee or Texas law. The contract contained in the original policy was a Tennessee contract. The law of Tennessee entered into it and became a part of it. The Texas statute was incapable of being constitutionally applied to it since the effect of such application would be to regulate business outside the state of Texas and control contracts made by citizens of other states in disregard of their laws under which penalties and attorney's fees are not recoverable. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Head, \n234 \nU.S. 149\n, 34 S. Ct. 879; Overby v. Gordon, \n177 \nU.S. 214, 222\n, 20 S. Ct. 603. The second policy here was issued in pursuance of, and was dependent for its existence and its terms upon, the express provisions of the contract contained in the first one. By those provisions, upon the simple application of the insured, the new policy must issue. Nothing was left to future agreement. The terms of the new policy were fixed when the original policy was made. In effect, it is as though the first policy had provided that upon demand of the insured and payment of the stipulated, increase in premiums that policy should, automatically, become a 20- payment life commercial policy. It was issued not as the result of any new negotiation or agreement but \n\n[266 U.S. 389, 400]\n\u00a0\n in discharge of pre-existing obligations. It merely fulfilled promises then outstanding; and did not arise from new or additional promises. The result in legal contemplation was not a novation but the consummation of an alternative specifically accorded by, and enforceable in virtue of, the original contract. If the insurance company had refused to issue the second policy upon demand, the insured could have compelled it by a suit in equity for specific performance. See Tayloe v. Merchants' Fire Ins. Co., 9 How. 390, 405.\n From these premises it necessarily results that the second policy follows the status of the first for which it was exchanged, and is not subject to the Texas statute relating to penalties and attorney's fees but is controlled by Tennessee law. The judgment below, therefore, in so far as it gives effect to the Texas statute by imposing a penalty of twelve per cent. and allowing attorney's fees, is erroneous, in that the Texas statute cannot constitutionally be applied to a Tennessee contract.\n Third. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the third contention urged as ground for reversal.\n The judgment below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAIR-WAY ELECTRIC APPLIANCE CORPORATION v. DAY(1924)\nNo. 31\nArgued: Decided: October 20, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 71, 72]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Newton A. Tracy, Thomas H. Tracy, and Geo. D. Welles, all of Toledo, Ohio, for Air-Way Electric Appliance Corporation.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 71, 76]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. J. Meyer, of Columbus, Ohio, for State Treasurer. \n\n[266 U.S. 71, 77]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff, Air-Way Electric Appliance Corporation, brought this suit against the above-named treasurer and other state officers to restrain the collection of a franchise fee charged against it as a foreign corporation for the privilege of exercising its franchises in Ohio during the year commencing July 1, 1921, on the grounds, among others, that the legislation of Ohio, under which the fee was imposed, is invalid under the commerce clause of the Constitution, and is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Plaintiff was incorporated in 1920 under the laws of Delaware. Under its certificate of incorporation and the laws of that state, its authorized capital stock is 400,000 shares without par value, of which 200, 000 shares are common stock and 200,000 founders' stock. The only \n\n[266 U.S. 71, 78]\n\u00a0\n difference between the two classes is that holders of the former are entitled to one vote per share and of the latter to five votes per share. Shortly after its incorporation, it obtained from the secretary of state in conformity with the laws of Ohio a certificate of admission to do business in that state, and also paid the initial fee for the privilege of there exercising its franchise. Sections 178-180, 183, 184, General Code of Ohio. It complied with the laws of Ohio regulating the sale of stock in that state and received a certificate from the commissioner of securities authorizing sale at $7 per share. Sections 6373-1 to 6373-24, General Code of Ohio. It acquired two large manufacturing plants at Toledo, including grounds, buildings, tools, machinery, etc. August 1, 1920, it commenced business-the manufacture of electrical household appliances and their sale in Ohio and elsewhere. In July, 1921, as required by law, it filed with the tax commission a report covering the year ended July 1, 1921. There had been issued and were then outstanding only 50,485 shares of stock, of which 10,010 shares were common and 40,475 were founders' stock. All of its property was located in Ohio; its value was $458,278.56. The amount of business transacted in the preceding year was $250,594.58. The complaint alleged and the answer admitted that the value of the stock was $7 per share.\n Section 5503 (enacted May 31, 1911) imposes an annual fee required of foreign corporations having capital stock with par value as follows: 'On or before October fifteenth, the auditor of state shall charge for collection, as herein provided, annually, from such company, in addition to the initial fees otherwise provided for by law, for the privilege of exercising its franchises in this state, a fee of three-twentieths of one per cent. upon the proportion of the authorized capital stock of the corporation represented by property owned and used and business transacted in this state. ...' \n\n[266 U.S. 71, 79]\n\u00a0\n An act of May 14, 1921 (109 Ohio Laws, p. 277), amending section 8728- 11, General Code of Ohio, provides: '... The amount of fees payable by a foreign corporation having common stock without par value ... under section 5503 shall be three-twentieths of one per cent. upon the proportion of the authorized preferred stock represented by property owned and used and business transacted in this state and five cents per share upon the proportion of the number of shares of authorized common stock, represented by property owned and used and business transacted in this state. ...'\n Under the section last quoted, an annual fee of $20,000 was assessed and payment on or before December 1, 1921, was demanded, and notice was given that, if not made on or before that day, a penalty of 15 per cent. would be added. Under the laws of the state, all fees, taxes, and penalties constitute liens on the corporation's property; a fine for each day's delinquency may be imposed; and, in case of failure to pay, its authority to do business is liable to cancellation, and injunction and ouster are authorized. Sections 5506, 5507, 5509, 5512, 5513\n\n\n Plaintiff's report to the tax commission stated that the amount of business transacted in Ohio in the year ended July 1, 1920, was $250,594. 58, whereas that figure represented its total sales, of which only $70,802. 30, or about 28 per cent., was intrastate, and the balance, $179,792.28, or about 72 per cent., was interstate. The state officers, assuming that all plaintiff's property and business was located and transacted in Ohio, made no apportionment between local and interstate business and fixed the annual franchise fee at 5 cents per share on its total authorized stock.\n Plaintiff invoked equity jurisdiction on the ground that it was threatened with irreparable injury through the enforcement of the coercive provisions of the statutes above referred to. Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 587\n, 34 S. Ct. 372. A motion \n\n[266 U.S. 71, 80]\n\u00a0\n for a temporary injunction was heard by a court of three judges. Section 266, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243). It was held (279 Fed. 878) that the plaintiff's objections to the act and the tax were not valid; but the bill was retained to await the result of an application by the plaintiff to the tax commission for a rehearing and correction of the amount of the tax. Plaintiff made such an application, setting forth the above mentioned amount of intrastate and interstate sales respectively. The commission held that, as more than 60 days had elapsed after the certification of the amount of the tax by the state auditor, it had no jurisdiction to entertain such an application. At a later hearing, the court held that the commission was authorized to grant plaintiff a rehearing and make correction if it found the tax or any part of it to be erroneous; that it was not the intent of the state laws to include interstate commerce as a basis for the levy, and that plaintiff may not be taxed on its interstate business and on the portion of its authorized stock represented by property owned and used and business transacted in other states; that the $ 20,000 charge included a substantial sum levied directly on the stock representing interstate business and that the tax should have been $14,926- 5 cents per share on 298,520 shares. These figures were arrived at by taking such proportion of 400,000, the total number of shares authorized, as the actual value of plaintiff's property in Ohio plus its local business in that state is to such actual value plus all its business, and by applying thereto 5 cents per share. \n1\n By the decree defendants \n\n[266 U.S. 71, 81]\n\u00a0\n are enjoined from collecting any part of the tax in excess of $14,926. The plaintiff appealed, and attacks the act on the grounds above stated. Defendants appealed and contend that the lower court erred in finding that 298,520 shares of the authorized capital stock of plaintiff represented the property owned and used and business transacted by it in Ohio, and in enjoining the collection of a tax in excess of $14,926.\n In cases involving the validity of the laws of a state imposing license fees or excise taxes on corporations organized in another state, this court has decided:\n'1. The power of a state to regulate the transaction of a local business within its borders by a foreign corporation-meaning a corporation of a sister state-is not unrestricted or absolute, but must be exerted in subordination to the limitations which the Constitution places on state action.\n\n'2. Under the commerce clause exclusive power to regulate interstate commerce rests in Congress, and a state statute which either directly or by its necessary operation burdens such commerce is invalid, regardless of the purpose with which it was enacted.\n\n'3. Consistently with the due process clause, a state cannot tax property belonging to a foreign corporation and neither located nor used within the confines of the state.\n\n'4. That a foreign corporation is partly, or even chiefly, engaged in interstate commerce does not prevent a state in which it has property and is doing a local business from taxing that property and imposing a license fee or excise in respect of that business, but the state cannot require the corporation as a condition of the right to do a local business therein to submit to a tax on its interstate business or on its property outside the state.\n\n'5. A license fee or excise of a given per cent. of the entire authorized capital of a foreign corporation doing \n\n[266 U.S. 71, 82]\n\u00a0\n both a local and interstate business in several states, although declared by the state imposing it to be merely a charge for the privilege of conducting a local business therein, is essentially and for every practical purpose a tax on the entire business of the corporation, including that which is interstate, and on its entire property, including that in other states, and this because the capital stock of the corporation represents all its business of every class and all its property wherever located.\n\n'6. When tested, as it must be, by its substance-its essential and practical operation-rather than its form or local characterization, such a license fee or excise is unconstitutional and void as illegally burdening interstate commerce and also as wanting in due process because laying a tax on property beyond the jurisdiction of the state.'\n\n International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 135, 141\n, 38 S. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617.\n All plaintiff's business, intrastate and interstate, and all its property wherever located were represented by the 50,485 shares of stock outstanding. The annual fee demanded by the state officers is five cents per share on 400,000 shares, and that fixed by the lower court is based on 298,520 shares. The inevitable effect of the act is to tax and directly burden interstate commerce of foreign corporations permitted to do business in Ohio, and engaged in interstate commerce, wherever the number of shares authorized, subject to the charge of 5 cents each, exceeds the number of outstanding shares attributable to or represented by the corporation's property and business in that state. In this case, the fee fixed by the commission was based on nearly eight times the number of outstanding shares and that determined by the court on nearly six times that number. As some of the outstanding shares are represented by plaintiff's interstate business, the application of the rate to all the shares, or to a number greater than the total outstanding, necessarily amounts to \n\n[266 U.S. 71, 83]\n\u00a0\n a tax and direct burden upon all the property and business including the interstate commerce of the plaintiff. International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, p. 142 (38 S. Ct. 292). We hold that the act violates the commerce clause.\n The fee determined by the lower court, as well as that fixed by the state officers, is arbitrary. Without holding that such a charge must be measured by the value of the privilege for which it is imposed, it may be said that some relation to such value is a reasonable requirement. Indeed, under the Constitution and laws of Ohio, a tax on privileges and franchises cannot exceed the reasonable value of the privilege or franchise originally conferred or its continued annual value thereafter. Southern Gum Co. v. Laylin, 66 Ohio St. 578, 64 N. E. 564. That value depends on the 'property owned and used and business transacted' in Ohio. Section 8728-11. Plaintiff's authority to issue stock or the number of shares it may have outstanding at any time does not depend upon the laws of Ohio. Under the laws of Delaware where the corporation was organized, these matters are left to the discretion of the persons controlling the corporation. Laws of Delaware 1917, c. 113,  3, amending, by adding 1918a, section 4a to Revised Code, c. 65. The number of nonpar value shares of the corporation is not an indication of, and does not purport to be a representation as to, the amount of its capital. Each outstanding share represents merely an aliquot part of its assets. The number of shares not subscribed or issued has no relation to the privilege held by plaintiff in Ohio, and it is not a reasonable measure of such a fee. Such shares may never be subscribed or issued, or additional shares may be issued to acquire property or do business in other states or to carry on interstate commerce. Plainly the fee, to the extent that it is based on a number of shares in excess of those outstanding, has no relation to what was paid in for the stock or to its value or to the amount of plaintiff's capital, its property or its business, \n\n[266 U.S. 71, 84]\n\u00a0\n intrastate in Ohio or interstate. The act in its practical operation does not require like fees for equal privileges held by foreign corporations in Ohio under the same circumstances. Unless, under the laws of the states where organized they chance to be authorized to issue the same number of nonpar value shares, the annual franchise fees imposed on foreign corporations having the same amount of property and business, and exercising the same privileges in Ohio will not be the same, and the charge imposed on one may be many times that made against another. If plaintiff's authorized shares were of the par value of $100 each, the amount of capital stock for apportionment between its property and business in Ohio and its interstate business to arrive at the franchise fee would be $40,000,000, and, adopting the basis of apportionment determined by the lower court which attributed about 75 per cent. of the shares to the property and business in Ohio, the amount of the fee would be $44,778, and with par value of $7 each, the amount for which the commissioner of securities authorized plaintiff to sell its shares in Ohio, and their admitted value, the amount for such apportionment would be $2, 800,000, and the fee would be $3,134.46.2 These figures are to be contrasted with $14,926, fixed by the lower court. Again, compare two corporations organized in a sister state having the same number of authorized nonpar value shares, one having property and business of little value, all in Ohio, and the other having much more property and business in that state, and also much property and business in other states. The act would require the former to pay 5 \n\n[266 U.S. 71, 85]\n\u00a0\n cents per share on all its shares, but would require the latter to pay a fee based only on the proportion of its shares representing its property owned and used and business transacted in Ohio.\n It is clear that the mere number of authorized nonpar value shares is not a reasonable basis for the classification of foreign corporations for the purpose of determining the amount of such annual fees. Such a classification is not based on anything having relation to the purpose for which it is made. Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 417\n, 30 S. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247; Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 40 S. Ct. 560. The act has no tendency to produce equality; and it is of such a character that there is no reasonable presumption that substantial equality will result from its application. Martin v. District of Columbia, \n205 \nU.S. 135, 139\n, 27 S. Ct. 440; Gast Realty Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., \n240 \nU.S. 55, 58\n, 36 S. Ct. 254; Kansas City Southern Ry. v.

It was applied as follows:\n $458,278.56 + $70,802.30\/$458,278.56 + $250,594.58 x 400,000=298,520\n 298,520 x $0.05=$14,926.00. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] If par value were $100:\n 298,520 x $100 = $29,852,000.\n $29,852.000 x 3\/20 of 1% = $44,778 amount of tax.\n If par value were $7:\n 298,520 x $7 = $2,089,640.\n $2,089,640 x 3\/20 of 1% = $3,134.46 amount of tax. \n\n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nASAKURA v. CITY OF SEATTLE, 265 U.S. 332 (1924)(1924)\nNo. 211\nArgued: Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\nMr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\nPlaintiff in error is a subject of the Emperor of Japan, and, since 1904, has resided in Seattle, Washington.  Since July, 1915, he has been engaged in business there as a pawnbroker. The city passed an ordinance, which  took effect July 2, 1921, regulating the business of pawnbroker and repealing former ordinances on the same subject.  It makes it unlawful for any person to engage in the business unless he shall have a license, and the ordinance provides  \"that no such license shall be granted unless the applicant be a citizen of the United States.\" Violations of the ordinance are punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.  Plaintiff in error brought this suit in the Superior Court of King County, Washington, against the city, its Comptroller and its Chief of Police to restrain them from enforcing the ordinance against him.  He attacked the ordinance on the ground that it violates the treaty between the United States  and the Empire of Japan, proclaimed April 5, 1911 (37 Stat. 1504); violates the constitution of the State of Washington, and also the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.He declared his willingness to comply with any valid ordinance relating to the business of pawnbroker. It was shown that he had about $5,000 invested in his business, which would be broken up and destroyed by the enforcement  of the ordinance. The Superior Court granted the relief prayed.  On appeal, the Supreme Court of the State held the ordinance valid and reversed the decree.  The case is here on writ of error under \u00a7 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. \u00a7 1214).\nDoes the ordinance violate the treaty? Plaintiff in error invokes and relies upon the following provisions: \"The citizens or subjects of each of the High Contracting Parties shall have liberty to enter, travel and reside in the territories of the other to carry on trade, wholesale and retail, to own or lease and occupy houses, manufactories, warehouses and shops, to employ agents of their choice, to lease land for residential and commercial purposes, and generally to do anything incident to or necessary for trade upon the same terms as native citizens or subjects, submitting themselves to the laws and regulations there established. . . .  The citizens or subjects of each . . . shall receive, in the territories of the other, the most constant protection and security for their persons and property, . . . .\"\nA treaty made under the authority of the United States \"shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound  thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\" Constitution, Art. VI, \u00a7 2.\nThe treaty-making power of the United States is not limited by any express provision of the Constitution, and, though it does not extend \"so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids,\" it does extend to all proper subjects of negotiation between our government and other nations.  Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U.S. 258, 266, 267; In re Ross, 140 U.S. 453, 463; Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416. The treaty was made to strengthen friendly relations between the two nations.  As to the things covered by it, the provision quoted establishes the rule of equality between Japanese subjects while in this country and native citizens.  Treaties for the protection of citizens of one country residing in the territory of another are numerous,[120 U.S. 678, 682-683. The rule of equality established by it cannot be rendered nugatory in any part of the United States by municipal ordinances or state laws.  It stands on the same footing of supremacy as do  the provisions of the Constitution and laws of the United States.  It operates of itself without the aid of any legislation, state or national; and it will be applied and given authoritative effect by the courts.  Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 314; Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580, 598; Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U.S. 536, 540; Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U.S. 190, 194; Maiorano v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., 213 U.S. 268, 272.\nThe purpose of the ordinance complained of is to regulate, not to prohibit, the business of pawnbroker. But it  makes it impossible for aliens to carry on the business.  It need not be considered whether the State, if it sees fit, may forbid and destroy the business generally.  Such a law would apply equally to aliens and citizens, and no question of conflict with the treaty would arise.  The grievance here alleged is that plaintiff in error, in violation of the treaty, is denied equal opportunity.\nIt remains to be considered whether the business of pawnbroker is \"trade\" within the meaning of the treaty. Treaties are to be construed in a broad  and liberal spirit, and, when two constructions are possible, one restrictive of rights that may be claimed under it and the other favorable to them, the latter is to be preferred.  Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U.S. 483, 487; Geofroy v. Riggs, supra, 271;  Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U.S. 424, 437. The ordinance defines \"pawnbroker\" to  \"mean and include every person whose business or occupation [it] is to take and receive by way of pledge, pawn or exchange, goods, wares or merchandise, or any kind of personal property whatever, for the repayment or security of any money loaned thereon, or to loan money on deposit of personal property\"; and defines \"pawnshop\" to \"mean and include every place at which the business of pawnbroker is carried on.\" The language of the treaty is comprehensive.  The phrase \"to carry on trade\" is broad.  That it is not to be given a restricted meaning is plain.  The clauses \"to own or lease . . . shops, . . . to lease land for . . . commercial purposes, and generally to do anything incident to or necessary for trade,\" and \"shall receive . . . the most constant protection and security for their . . . property . . .\" all go to show the intention  of the parties that the citizens or subjects to either shall have liberty in the territory of the other to engage in all kinds and classes of business that are or reasonably may be embraced within the meaning of the word \"trade\" as used in the treaty.\nBy definition contained in the ordinance, pawnbrokers are regarded as carrying on a \"business.\" A feature of it is the lending of money upon the pledge or pawn of personal property which, in case of default, may be sold to pay the debt.  While the amounts of the loans made in that business are relatively small and the character of property pledged as security is different, the transactions are similar to loans made by banks on collateral security.The business of lending money on portable securities has been carried on for centuries.  In most of the countries of Europe, the pledge system is carried on by governmental agencies; in some of them the business is also carried on by private parties.  In England, as in the United States, the private pledge system prevails.  In this country, the practice of pledging personal property for loans dates back to early colonial times, and pawnshops have been regulated by state laws for  more than a century.  We have found no state legislation abolishing or forbidding the business.  Most, if not all, of the States provide for licensing pawnbrokers and authorize regulation by municipalities.While regulation has been found necessary in the public interest, the business is not on that account to be excluded from the trade and commerce referred to in the treaty. Many worthy occupations and lines of legitimate business are regulated by state and federal laws for the protection of the public against fraudulent and dishonest practices.  There is nothing in the character of the business of pawnbroker which requires it to be excluded from the field covered by the above quoted provision, and it must be held that such business is \"trade\" within the meaning of the treaty. The ordinance violates the treaty. The question in the present case relates solely to Japanese subjects who have been admitted to this country.  We do not pass upon the right of admission or the construction of the treaty in this respect, as that question is not before us and would require consideration of  other matters with which it is not now necessary to deal.  We need not consider other grounds  upon which the ordinance is attacked.\nDecrease reversed.\n\n[1] See \"Handbook of Commercial Treaties,\" prepared by United States Tariff Commission, 1922.\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATCHISON, T & S F R.

The injuries resulted in death. The action was brought in one of the superior courts of the state of California, and removed on petition of petitioner to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Southern Division.\n The amount sued for was $35,586.42, being composed of the elements of $ 15,000 for the loss of services and advice of the wife, $20,000 for the loss of her society, love, and affection, and $586.42 for various specified services. \n\n[264 U.S. 348, 350]\n\u00a0\n Judgment was rendered for petitioner, with costs. It was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, with directions to enter judgment for Nichols in the sum of $5,000.\n The question of liability in some court petitioner does not contest. It contests only that the law of New Mexico, upon which liability of petitioner was based, is in conflict with the policy of the state of California, expressed in the laws and decisions of the state. We therefore immediately encounter as an element for consideration the law of New Mexico. It is as follows:\n'Whenever any person shall die from any injury resulting from, or occasioned by the negligence, unskillfulness or criminal intent of any officer, agent, servant or employe, whilst running, conducting or managing any locomotive, car, or train of cars, ... shall forfeit and pay for every person or passenger so dying the sum of five thousand dollars, which may be sued and recovered, first, by the husband. ...' Code N. M. 1915,  1820\n\n\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the law. Judge Ross, addressing himself to the contention that the law could not be enforced or administered in California, or in a federal court sitting in California, and considering the ground of the contention to be that the law is penal, said:\n'But a penal law is one thing, and a statute intended to protect life and to impose a new and extraordinary civil liability upon those causing death, by subjecting then to a private action for the pecuniary damages thereby resulting to the family of the deceased, is quite another. The latter is a question of general law.'\n\n For this were adduced Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 U.S. 657\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 224; Dennick v. Railroad Co., \n103 U.S. 11\n; Texas & Pacific Railway v. Cox, \n145 U.S. 593\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 905.\n The principle announced is contested, and the application of the cases adduced to support it. The attack is \n\n[264 U.S. 348, 351]\n\u00a0\n naturally directed against Huntington v. Attrill, as it declares itself to be in submission and sequence to the other cases, as well as the expression of independent reasoning and conclusion. The question there, as here, was upon the character of a statute having 'aspects' of penalty. It ( the statute) was, however, excluded from the class of criminal laws which had their venue of commission and trial where committed, for it was decided to be, applying and quoting from Dennick v. Railroad Co., supra, 'though a statutory remedy, a civil action to recover damages for a civil injury,' and this because the court decided that, when a statute like the one passed on is involved in consideration, the question whether it is one 'which in some aspects may be called penal, is a penal law in the international sense, so that it cannot be enforced in the courts of another state, depends upon the question whether its purpose is to punish an offense against the public justice of the state, or to afford a private remedy to a person injured by the wrongful act.'\n The reasoning of the court is very complete, with the pertinence of cases, and it has the supplement of a number of state rulings which the Circuit Court of Appeals has adduced.\n The law of New Mexico is within the principle and description of those rulings, and of Huntington v. Attrill. It is in reparation of a private injury, not in punishment of 'an offense against the public justice of the state.' Its reparation is in a fixed amount, it is true, but it is in an amount that has been fixed by a consideration of the determining factors, they necessarily having a certain similarity in all cases. It was the legislative judgment, therefore, that the interests of the state would best be served by an exact definition of the measure of responsibility and relief when the circumstances were such as are represented in the law. It is not less reparative because so defined. \n\n[264 U.S. 348, 352]\n\u00a0\n Against this conclusion an argument can be opposed, and is opposed- one not without strength and the support of cases. We are unable to yield to it. We repeat, we think the motive and effect of the law is not punishment in the sense of a penal law, but remuneration-'damages for a civil injury.' And a peculiar injury, one resulting from death and its deprivations-deprivations difficult to estimate (and which the common law did not estimate in individual injury and redress), and, therefore, we think properly within the power of the state-its power to make provision for the controversies and rights that may grow out of the relations of its people.\n The contention of petitioner is, as we understand it, not that damages in redress of death are opposed to the policy of California, but only when damages are given in a fixed amount as provided by the law of New Mexico, the Code of Civil Procedure of the state giving such damages only 'as under all the circumstances of the case may be just,'1 therefore, confining the damages to compensation for pecuniary loss suffered by surviving relatives of the deceased. This may be conceded; there is nothing in the law of New Mexico that transcends the purpose. It does not preclude the recovery of damages; it only defines them, recognizing, as the Supreme Court of California has recognized, the incapability of precise accuracy being attained either by court or jury of the damages that may result from the death of a person to surviving relatives.

North Alaska Salmon Co., 153 Cal. 438, 95 Pac. 862.\n We do not regard, therefore, the Code of the state as expressing the policy of the state to be that the aid of its courts and of the federal courts sitting in the state are to be denied the power to enforce the redress given by the law of the state where the injury was inflicted, the law not being penal.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Sec. 377.

C., for petitioner.\n Mr. George E. Wallace, of El Paso, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Wells, a citizen and resident of Colorado, employed by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, was injured while performing his duties in New Mexico. He sued the company in a state court of Texas, but could not make personal service upon it within that state. \n1\n Wells procured from the same court a writ of garnishment to a Texas railroad company whose line connected with the Santa Fe, which had in its possession Santa Fe rolling stock, and which owed to it large sums on traffic balances. Thereafter constructive service was made upon the Santa Fe, by serving one of its officers in Kansas and by publication in a Texas newspaper. The Santa Fe did not appear in the action, and judgment in the sum of $4,000 and costs was entered against it by default. Objection by the garnishee to the jurisdiction having been overruled, a judgment was entered that Wells recover from it this sum with interest and costs, in satisfaction of his judgment against the Santa Fe. To enjoin the enforcement of these judgments, suit was brought by the Santa Fe in the federal court for western Texas against Wells, who had meanwhile become a resident of that state, and his counsel. The case was heard on agreed facts, and a decree dismissing the bill was affirmed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \n\n[265 U.S. 101, 103]\n\u00a0\n 285 Fed. 369. It is here on writ of certiorari under section 240 of the Judicial Code. \n261 U.S. 612\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 519.\n The rolling stock held by the garnishee was then being used in interstate commerce and the amount due on traffic balances arose out of transactions in such commerce. These facts did not render the property immune from seizure by attachment or garnishment. Davis v. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co., \n217 U.S. 157\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 463, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 823, 18 Ann. Cas. 907. But the writ of garnishment is void because of the purpose for which it was invoked. The Santa Fe is a Kansas corporation. It had not been admitted to Texas as a foreign corporation. It had not consented to be sued there. It did not own or operate any line of railroad within the state, and had no agent there. The Texas statutes concerning garnishment were construed and applied in the Wells suit, so as to permit a citizen and resident of another state to prosecute in Texas a cause of action which arose elsewhere against a railroad corporation of another state, which is engaged in interstate commerce, which neither owns nor operates a railroad in Texas, and which has not consented to be sued there. For the reasons stated in Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Co., \n262 U.S. 312\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 556 ( decided since the entry of the judgment here under review), such a suit necessarily and unreasonably burdens interstate commerce, and the statute as construed and applied is invalid.\n Relief against the void judgments entered was properly sought by the Santa Fe in the federal court. Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., \n236 U.S. 115\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 255; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 U.S. 175\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 93. See Essanay Film Co. v. Kane, \n258 \nU.S. 358, 360\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 318. The garnishment was void because seizure of the rolling stock and credits for the purpose of compelling the Santa Fe to submit to the jurisdiction of the court in the Wells suit interfered unreasonably with interstate commerce. The Santa Fe was not obliged to assert its rights in the courts of Texas. Compare Firestone \n\n[265 U.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n Tire & Rubber Co. v. Marlboro Cotton Mills (C. C. A.) 282 Fed. 811, 814. Nor could its right not to be sued there be affected by anything which the garnishee did or omitted to do. Moreover, the garnishee's objection to the jurisdiction (on grounds later upheld by this court in the Farmers' Cooperative Co. Case) had been overruled by the state court. We have no occasion, therefore, to consider further the scope or the provisions of the statutes concerning garnishment.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry.

C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Transportation Act 1920 (Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91) title 4,  402(15), 41 Stat. 456, 474, 476 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563\n\n[266 U.S. 127, 15]\n\u00a0\n), authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission, whenever it is of opinion that shortage of equipment, congestion of traffic or other emergency requiring immediate action exists in any section of the country, to suspend its rules as to car service and to make such reasonable rules with regard to it as in the Commission's opinion will best promote the service in the interest of the public and the commerce of the people; and also, among other things, to give direction for preference or priority in transportation or movement of traffic.\n On July 25, 1922, the Interstate Commerce Commission, reciting that in the opinion of the Commission an emergency which required immediate action existed upon the railroad lines east of the Mississippi River, ordered that coal cars should be furnished to the mines according to a certain order of purposes numbered in classes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and that no coal embraced in classes 1, 2, 3 or 4 should be subject to reconsignment or diversion except for some purpose in the same or a superior class. The making of gas falls in Class 2; the making of Portland Cement into Class 5.\n The plaintiff in error was indicted for fraudulently inducing interstate carriers to transport coal seemingly intended to be used to make gas but actually intended to be used to make Portland Cement in violation of the Commission's order. A demurrer to this indictment was overruled and the plaintiff in error pleaded guilty and \n\n[266 U.S. 127, 130]\n\u00a0\n was sentenced to a fine. Subsequently he moved in arrest of judgment upon the grounds that the order and the statute if it authorized the order were unconstitutional, as depriving him of due process of law, and as exercising a power reserved to the States; and also that the order granted a preference to the ports of one State over those of another. The motion was overruled and a writ of error was taken direct to this Court.\n The right to come here depends upon the presence of some substantial constitutional question. But so far as such questions are raised we are of opinion that they are not substantial in view of previous decisions. We must take it that an emergency contemplated by the statute existed, as found by the Commission and alleged in the indictment. That in such circumstances Congress could require a preference in the order of purposes for which coal should be carried, consistently with the Fifth Amendment is clear, and is assumed in Peoria & Pekin Union Ry.

That it can do so without trenching upon the powers reserved to the States seems to us not to need argument.

The defendants, the petitioners here, relied upon a title by the ordinary prescription of ten years' possession under a just title and in good faith, the sale to them having been made more than ten years before this suit was begun. The sale took place under an order of the local District Court having jurisdiction over the minors and over the tutor, but the Circuit Court of Appeals overruling the Supreme Court of Porto Rico held that this was not sufficient to constitute just title, seemingly being of opinion that the purchasers were chargeable with notice that the record would have disclosed the failure of the guardian to satisfy what it regarded as conditions precedent to the exercise of his power. 288 F. 28, sub nom. Ayllon v. Gonzalez. A writ of certiorari was \n\n[266 U.S. 144, 146]\n\u00a0\n granted by this Court. \n263 \nU.S. 691\n, 44 S. Ct. 5. Of course there is no doubt of our jurisdiction upon certiorari although the respondents seem to have been misled by some decisions upon writs of error. Judicial Code,  240 (Comp. St.  1217). We shall assume without argument that the Circuit Court of Appeals also was right in taking jurisdiction on the ground that the value of the land exceeded five thousand dollars and that the title to the land was in issue in this suit. Act of January 28, 1915, c. 22,  2; 38 Stat. 803, 804.\n The decision of the Supreme Court of Porto Rico turned upon local statutes and local traditions. The caution to be used before overruling such decisions was emphasized in a recent case where the action of the Supreme Court was open to greater doubt than here. Diaz v. Gonzalez, \n261 \nU.S. 102, 106\n, 43 S. Ct. 286. For here apart from the respect due to the local judgment its reasoning commands our assent. The question is whether the defendants held their possessions under a 'just' or 'proper' title as it is called indifferently, within the meaning of the law that allows a ten-year prescription in that case in place of the thirty years for which a just title is not required. As remarked by the Porto Rican Court a just title does not mean a perfect title, as otherwise prescription would not be needed. See United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., \n209 \nU.S. 447, 450\n, 28 S. Ct. 579. If the title is good on its face and the possessor under it has no notice of any extrinsic defect, it will found a good title in ten years. The order of sale disclosed no defect, and the Supreme Court held that as it issued from a Court having jurisdiction over the minors and over the tutor, as we have said, the purchasers were not bound to look further. They had no actual notice of the omissions of the tutor, and for the purposes of a possession in good faith that would satisfy the law. They were entitled to assume that all necessary conditions had been fulfilled. We need not consider the further intimation of the Court, also to be respected, that \n\n[266 U.S. 144, 147]\n\u00a0\n the failure to register and to give bond did not make the sale void.\n Longpre v. Diaz, \n237 \nU.S. 512\n, 35 S. Ct. 731, has no bearing on the present case. There the conveyance assailed was made with no semblance of authority, as the parties knew, and it was held that persons holding under a conveyance that was void upon the facts known to them could not be possessors in good faith, and that a judge of first instance had no jurisdiction to validate the sale at a later date. Here the judge had the jurisdiction that we have stated and an order that on its face was a valid exercise of that jurisdiction furnished a proper title to one who believed the facts to be as the order implied.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE & O. S. W. R. CO. v. BURTCH(1924)\nNo. 115\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 540, 541]\n\u00a0\n William A. Eggers and Morison R. Waite, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Oscar H. Montgomery, of Seymour, Ind., and Merrill Moores, of Indianapolis, Ind., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by Guerney O. Burtch against the Railroad Company to recover damages for a personal injury suffered, as a result of the company's negligence, while he was engaged in assisting to unload a heavy ensilage cutter from a freight train at Commisky, Ind. \n\n[263 U.S. 540, 542]\n\u00a0\n After the allowance of the writ of certiorari Burtch died and his administratrix was substituted as respondent.\n The complaint is in two counts, the only one necessary to be considered being drawn upon the theory that at the time of the injury Burtch was an employee of the company and both were engaged in intrastate commerce. The answer denies the allegations of the complaint and alleges facts to establish that at the time of the injury they were engaged in interstate commerce. The contention, therefore, upon the one hand, was that the case was governed by the state, and upon the other hand that it was governed by the federal, Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657- 8665). The distinction is material, since certain common-law defenses, abrogated by the former, are still available under the latter.\n It is clear that the trial court assumed that the state and not the national law applied, and the case was submitted to the jury upon that theory; and this presents the only question which it is necessary for us to consider. The jury returned a verdict in Burtch's favor, the judgment upon which was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 134 N. E. 858.\n That the train carrying the cutter came from Louisville, Ky., is not disputed; but it is contended that there was no evidence from which it could be determined that the shipment originated there, or at any other point outside the state of Indiana; and the jury, in answer to certain interrogatories, so found. These interrogatories and answers are as follows:\n'Did said car come in said train from Louisville, Ky., to Commisky?\n\n'Ans. The train came from Louisville. No evidence where car came from.\n\n'Did said cutter come to Commisky from Louisville, Ky?\n\n'Ans. No evidence.' \n\n[263 U.S. 540, 543]\n\u00a0\n If, in truth, there be no evidence from which these facts can be found, or if the evidence be conflicting, we can, of course, inquire no further. But if, on the contrary, the uncontradicted evidence affirmatively establishes that the shipment originated in Louisville, Ky., and thence was carried to Commisky, Ind., it was an interstate shipment, and neither the special findings nor the general verdict will preclude us from so holding. Lurton, the consignee, testified that he obtained the cutter 'through an Indianapolis concern, but it was shipped from a warehouse in Louisville,' and that the bill of lading was made out to him from Louisville to Commisky. Hartwell, a telegraph operator testified that the freight train came from Louisville, and 'this cutter was in one of the cars of that train that came from Louisville.' This constitutes the entire evidence upon the point and plainly establishes the interstate character of the shipment. But this is not enough. It is necessary to show further that 'the employee at the time of the injury [was] engaged in interstate transportation, or in work so closely related to it as to be practically a part of it.' Shanks v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. Co., \n239 \nU.S. 556, 558\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 188, 189 (60 L. Ed. 436, L. R. A. 1916C, 797).\n\n There is a preliminary dispute as to whether Burtch stood in the relation of employee at the time of the injury, and this we first consider. The testimony shows that Burtch was not regularly employed, but that he engaged in this particular work at the request of the train conductor, because it was necessary to unload the cutter and the train crew was unable to do so without help. The evidence tends to show that the conductor, in making the request, followed a long-standing practice to call upon bystanders to assist in unloading heavy freight. These facts, either undisputed or established by the verdict of the jury under appropriate instructions, are ample to sustain the conclusion reached below that there was an exigency which authorized the conductor to employ outside \n\n[263 U.S. 540, 544]\n\u00a0\n assistance, and that Burtch, for the time being, occupied the relation of employee to the company. See, for example, Marks v. Railroad Co., 146 N. Y. 181, 189, 190, 40 N. E. 782; Fox v. Chicago, St. P. & K. C. R. Co., 86 Iowa, 368, 373, 53 N. W. 259, 17 L. R. A. 289; Haluptzok v. Great Northern Railway Co., 55 Minn. 446, 450, 57 N. W. 144, 26 L. R. A. 739; Maxson v. J. I. Case Threshing Machine Co., 81 Neb. 546, 550, 116 N. W. 281, 16 L. R. A . (N. S.) 963; Aga v. Harbach, 127 Iowa, 144, 102 N. W. 833, 109 Am. St. Rep. 377, 4 Ann. Cas. 441. The train upon arrival at Commisky drew in upon a sidetrack, where the cutter was unloaded, and the train then proceeded on its way. It was while assisting in this work that Burtch sustained the injury sued for. It is too plain to require discussion that the loading or unloading of an interstate shipment by the employees of a carrier is so closely related to interstate transportation as to be practically a part of it, and it follows that the facts fully satisfy the test laid down in the Shanks Case, supra.\n It appears that Burtch was interested in the cutter as part owner, and it is contended that in complying with the request of the conductor he assumed all responsibility because, in doing so, he simply discharged a duty imposed by a rule filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, requiring owners of heavy freight, under stated circumstances, stances, to unload it. The evidence, however, not only tends to show that conditions requiring compliance with the rule were absent, but the point is immaterial, in view of the finding of the jury to the effect that Burtch assisted in the work, not as owner, but in the capacity of an employee. Observance of the rule in question is required only to prevent discrimination among shippers. It has nothing to do with the interrelations of the carrier and its employees.\n Moreover, the failure to enforce the rule, if such there was, constituted no part of the causal sequence of events. Such failure would be merely an attendant circumstance, neither causing nor contributing to cause the injury, which, on the contrary, came about as the result of physical \n\n[263 U.S. 540, 545]\n\u00a0\n facts and conditions wholly apart therefrom. If, therefore, a violation of the rule be assumed, it would not avail to relieve the company from a liability which would otherwise exist. See Moran v. Dickinson, 204 Mass. 559, 562, 90 N. E. 1150, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 675; Newcomb v. Boston Protective Department, 146 Mass. 596, 16 N. E. 555, 4 Am. St. Rep. 354; Currelli v. Jackson, 77 Conn. 115, 122, 58 Atl. 762.\n Upon the facts now disclosed by the record the case is one arising under and governed by the federal Employers' Liability Act, and in that view it should have been submitted to the jury. The judgment of the state Supreme Court is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBANCO MEXICANO DE COMMERCIO E INDUSTRIA v.

Thereafter, as the appellants are informed and believe, under the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act and other statutes in such case made and provided, all moneys, securities, and property owned by the Deutsche Bank in the United States, or held for it by others, were turned over to or seized by the Alien Property Custodian of the United States, and have ever since been held by him.\n It is averred, on information and belief, that the money so loaned was never transferred from the United States physically or otherwise, but constituted a part of the balance \n\n[263 U.S. 591, 597]\n\u00a0\n of the general deposits and securities and other property in the United States of the bank, which were taken over and seized by the Alien Property Custodian. The total amount of such balance, and the total value of the securities and property, are unknown to appellants, but are sufficient, as they are informed and believe, after the payment and satisfaction of all other claims and demands, fully to pay, satisfy, and discharge the claim and demand of the appellants arising upon the loan.\n After the loan was made, and until its balance, securities, and other property were turned over to the Alien Property Custodian, the Deutsche Bank continuously kept in the United States sufficient funds and property over and above what was necessary to pay and discharge all other claims and demands of every kind, to repay the loan, with interest, and the funds and securities were kept in the United States for the express purpose and with the intention by the use thereof of repaying the loan when it fell due; and the bank would have, in the ordinary and usual course of business, repaid the same when the debt fell due, if war had not intervened between the United States and Germany.\n On June 15, 1917, there became due to appellants from the Deutsche Bank the amount of the loan, and it is still due, although they have made demands for the payment thereof upon the bank and the Alien Property Custodian.\n In pursuance of section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, the appellants, as liquidators and in behalf of the Banco Mexicano, or on about May 27, 1920, filed with the Alien Property Custodian a notice of claim, under oath, and in such form and containing such particulars as was required by that section and as the Custodian had prescribed, demanding payment of the debt above described, with interest thereon then accrued, by the Custodian, from the money or other property belonging to the bank, or held by him, or by the Treasurer of the United States. \n\n[263 U.S. 591, 598]\n\u00a0\n On or about the same day a similar application was filed with the President of the United States. Neither the President nor the Alien Property Custodian has paid the debt or the interest thereon.\n Appellants aver that since December 15, 1916, the Deutsche Bank kept in the United States sufficient cash and marketable securities over and above its obligations to enable it to pay the loan and interest, and that the Alien Property Custodian and Treasurer of the United States now hold sufficient cash and securities, formerly owned by the bank and seized by the Custodian, over and above all claims against the same, to pay the debt with interest.\n Appellants are advised and believe that, under the law of New York state, and in the event of default by the Deutsche Bank in the payment of the loan, they would have had, on June 15, 1917, and ever since, and now have, a cause of action against the bank upon which they could have sued and can now sue, and could have procured and can now procure, the issue of a writ of attachment under which the funds and securities of the bank in New York City could have been and now can be levied upon and seized and applied in satisfaction of a judgment obtained.\n It is averred that by reason of the foregoing facts the debt of the appellants arose with reference to the money and other property within the meaning and intention of subdivision (e) of section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act.\n A motion to dismiss the bill of appellants was made, the grounds thereof being:\n\n\n (1)\n Appellants are claimants other than citizens of the United States, and that the debt which they are seeking to recover did not arise with reference to money or any other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States under and pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended. \n\n[263 U.S. 591, 599]\n\u00a0\n (2) The appellants have not set forth facts sufficient to entitle them to equitable relief under section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended.\n The motion was granted, and a decree made and entered dismissing the bill.\n Upon the appeal of appellants the decree was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, to review which action this appeal is prosecuted.\n The case is in narrow compass. The facts are set forth in the bill; the law adduced, that is section 9 as amended, it is contencded, constitutes them grounds of recovery prayed for, and demonstrates the error in the decree appealed from. We quote it, although its pertinent and determining words are few. As passed October 6, 1917, it is as follows:\n'That any person not an enemy or ally of enemy claiming any interest, right, or title in any money or other property which may have been conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States, or to whom any debt may be owing from an enemy or ally of enemy whose property or any part thereof shall have been conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States may file with the said custodian a notice of his claim under oath and in such form and containing such particulars as the said Custodian shall require; and the President, if application is made therefor by the claimant, may order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery to said claimant of the money or other property so held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States, or of the interest therein to which the President shall determine said claimant is entitled: Provided, \n\n[263 U.S. 591, 600]\n\u00a0\n that no such order by the President shall bar any person from the prosecution of any suit at law or in equity against the claimant to establish any right, title, or interest which he may have in such money or other property. If the President shall not so order within sixty days after the filing of such application or if the claimant shall have filed the notice as above required and shall have made no application to the President, said claimant may, at any time before the expiration of six months after the end of the war institute a suit in equity in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia or in the District Court of the United States for the district in which such claimant resides, ... to establish the interest, right, title, or debt so claimed.' Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2e.\n\n The amendment of June 5, 1920, is as follows:\n'No money or other property shall be returned nor any debt allowed under this section to any person who is a citizen or subject of any nation which was associated with the United States in the prosecution of the war, unless such nation in like case extends reciprocal rights to citizens of the United States; nor in any event shall a debt be allowed under this section unless it was owing to and owned by the claimant prior to October 6, 1917, and as to claimants other than citizens of the United States unless it arose with reference to the money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or Treasurer of the United States hereunder.' Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923 ,  3115 1\/2e.\n\n The amendment provides that:\n'Nor in any event shall a debt be allowed under this section unless it was owing to and owned by the claimant prior to October 6, 1917, and as to claimants other than citizens of the United States unless it arose with reference to the money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or Treasurer of the United States hereunder.'\n\n The italics are ours and mark the words which make the controversy. The Court of Appeals regarded them a limitation upon the generality of the section as originally enacted-an \n\n[263 U.S. 591, 601]\n\u00a0\n exception from its indulgence of claimants other than citizens of the United States unless the debt arose with reference to the money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or Treasurer of the United States under the act.\n We concur. The Condition did not exist in the claimant. The debt did not arise with reference to the money or property held. The transaction was an ordinary business one, money borrowed to be repaid at a specified distant date; a deposit of it in the ordinary way and with the legal result and relation, the creation of debtor and creditor, not a word or act else-not a word or act else giving the transaction other character or quality. No distinction, indeed, from any other transaction, nothing to give specification to it or particular remedy.\n But particularity is not necessary, is the contention. Mere trace of relation seems, in counsel's view, to satisfy the requirement of section 9. The definition of the Standard Dictionary is adduced, and from it, it is said, it is reasonable to look upon \"with reference to\" as equivalent to \" with an eye toward.\" To give this pertinence, necessarily, the eye must see what the statute requires to be seen-a debt that had fixed some right or title or equity to the money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States.\n In support of counsel's view, the explanation of the amendment by the congressman in charge of it is quoted as giving a remedy to a just 'debt owed to a citizen of a friendly nation, that originated with reference to the property which is over here.' And further:\n'There would seem to be no reason in justice or good morals why that property here should not pay it subject to the limitation that it must have been a debt that accrued prior to the enactment of the Trading with the Enemy Act.'\n\n This is given emphasis of meaning by the contrast of 'enemy \n\n[263 U.S. 591, 602]\n\u00a0\n creditors' which it was declared 'should be collected by other means than out of this property here.' The views of the Attorney General were also referred to and the absence of any recommendation by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of an intention 'to make radical changes in the rights and remedies of friendly aliens as they had been created by the act previously in force.'\n It may be conceded that there is some suggestive strength in this history, but it is to be remembered that an act of legislation is not the act of one legislator, and its meaning and purpose must be expressed in words. If there be ambiguity in them it is the office of construction to resolve it. This we think the Court of Appeals exercised, and to a right conclusion.\n A contention, or rather the support of the main contention, is made by appellants by reference to the New York statutory law which authorized, it is said, an action against a foreign corporation-in this case by the Banco Mexicano against the Deutsche Bank-for the collection of its note, a writ of attachment and a judgment that could be satisfied out of the property attached. And the further contention is that by section 9, as amended:\n'Nonresident alien individuals and corporations were accorded broader rights even than they then enjoyed under the laws of New York, in that, they could collect their indebtedness out of the property of nonresident alien enemies in the hands of the Custodian wherever and however it arose and whatever its nature.'\n\n But this is a conclusion deduced from the construction put upon section 9 which we think is untenable.\n We repeat, we do not think that the debt arose with reference to the money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian.\n Therefore the prayer of the bill of complaint should be denied. We are constrained to this because we agree with \n\n[263 U.S. 591, 603]\n\u00a0\n the Court of appeals that this suit is in effect a suit against the United States and all of its conditions must obtain.\n Decree affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. \n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBARNETT v. KUNKEL(1924)\nNo. 134\nArgued: January 4, 1924Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied March 17, 1924. \n\n[264 U.S. 16, 17]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lewis C. Lawson, of Holdenville, Okl., and Malcolm E. Rosser, Joseph C. Stone, Charles A. Moon, and Francis Stewart, all of Muskogee, Okl., for appellants.\n Mr. Preston C. West, of Tulsa, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n W. A. Kunkel, a citizen of Indiana, began this suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma to quiet title to 160 acres of land in that district, and made defendants Hannah C. Barnett, her husband, Tucker K. Barnett, and others, all citizens of Oklahoma residing in the district. In his amended bill the complainant averred that he deraigned his title from one Mehaley Watson, a Creek citizen, to whom was allotted the land in question; that a patent was issued in her name, signed by the principal chief of the Creek Nation and approved by the Secretary of the Interior; that she died in October, 1908, before the issue of the patent in March, 1909; that she was an illegitimate child of the defendant, Hannah C. Barnett, a Creek of the full blood, who was her heir and inherited the land in question; that on March 22, 1909, in consideration of $500, the mother executed and delivered a warranty deed for the tract to one B. O. Sims; that on the same day the deed to Sims was approved by the county court of Hughes county, Okl., the court having jurisdiction to settle the estate of Mehaley Watson, deceased; that Sims conveyed to Brannan; that Brannan conveyed to Berrian and others, from whom by some 11 mesne conveyances, the details of which were set out in the bill, the land was conveyed, in March, 1913, to one R. S. \n\n[264 U.S. 16, 18]\n\u00a0\n Litchfield; that, the question then having arisen whether Mehaley Watson was not a resident of Okfuskee county, instead of Hughes county, when she died, Mrs. Barnett and her husband filed their petition in the county court of Okfuskee county, asking approval of her deed of March, 1909, to B. O. Sims, and obatined the approval of that court accordingly in consideration of $2,000 paid her by Litchfield; that Sims on the same day made and delivered a quitclaim deed of the land to Litchfield; that by several mesne conveyances, set forth, the tract became ultimately vested in the complainant; and that complainant in May, 1914, leased the land to the Prairie Oil & Gas Company for oil and gas purposes, which entered upon the land and was operating wells thereon and paying complainant rentals and royalties.\n The bill then alleged that the defendants and each of them were asserting title adverse to that of the complainant, by leases and conveyances of the land and otherwise, and unless restrained would make others, all of which were or would be clouds upon complainant's title; wherefore he prayed that defendants be required to set forth such right, title, or interest as may be asserted by them, and that the title of complainant be adjudged valid and quieted against defendants' claims.\n To the amended bill, the defendants Hannah C. Barnett and her husband filed an answer and cross-bill, in which they attacked the validity of her deed to Sims as violating section 9 of the Act of Congress of May 27, 1908 ( 35 Stat. 315), in three respects: First, it was executed two days before the patent to Mehaley Watson was approved by the Secretary of the Interior; second, the approval of the deed by the Hughes county court in 1909 was of no effect, because Mehaley Watson died a resident of Okfuskee county; and, third, the purported approval of the deed by the Okfuskee county court in 1913 was void, for the reason that it was made by the \n\n[264 U.S. 16, 19]\n\u00a0\n judge of that court during a vacation of the court, at his residence, and not at the courthouse, and that it was obtained by fraud upon the judge and Hannah Barnett. By cross-bill the Prairie Gas & Oil Company, a corporation of Kansas, was made defendant. Mrs. Barnett, asserting ownership in the land in herself, prayed for a decree declaring the Sims deed void, and quieting her title and an accounting for the profits made from the land by complainant and the Prairie Oil & Gas Company. Evidence was heard and a decree rendered by the District Court, finding for the complainant and quieting title in him. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, in which the decree of the District Court was reversed ( 259 Fed. 394, 170 C. C. A. 370), and the case remanded for another hearing because of the exclusion of material evidence. Upon a second hearing, the decree was again for the complainant, and on the second appeal the decree of the District Court was affirmed. 283 Fed. 24. A petition for certiorari was filed and submitted to this court October 23, 1922, and was denied November 13, 1922. \n260 U.S. 738\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 97.\n No question of our jurisdiction to hear this appeal is raised by the appellees, That, however, does not relieve us from the duty of inquiring into it. The jurisdiction of the District Court was invoked on the ground of diverse citizenship of the parties. There was no other ground set forth in the bill. The complainant, in deraigning his title, disclosed the fact that it rested on the allotment of the land in question to a deceased Creek Indian minor; that the land was inherited by the minor's mother, and was conveyed by that mother as a full-blood Creek Indian, with approval of the county court, all in accordance with and by virture of a law of Congress; but there was nothing to show on the face of the bill that the validity of this conveyance was questioned under that law. The averment that the defendants were asserting \n\n[264 U.S. 16, 20]\n\u00a0\n a conflicting title or interest did not show that the issues which the assertion of their claims would present for trial would necessarily involve the validity of the conveyances made under and by virtue of the federal law any more than the legal sufficiency of the many other conveyances set forth in the bill in the chain of complainant's title. It is true that the issues made by the answer clearly involved a consideration and construction of the effect of the federal statute of May 27, 1908, and perhaps others, but that fact subsequently developed would not furnish a ground for jurisdiction of a federal District Court. In Florida Central Railroad v. Bell, \n176 \nU.S. 321, 327\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 399, 401 ( 44 L. Ed. 486), it was said:\n'It must be regarded as conclusively established by our decisions that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court must appear in the plaintiffs' statement of their case'-citing Metcalf v. Watertown, \n128 U.S. 588\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 173; Colorado Central Mining Co. V. Turck, \n150 U.S. 138\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 35; Oregon Railway v. Skottowe, \n162 U.S. 490\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 869; Hanford v.

Ed. 486]):\n'In view of the frequent and recent decisions of this court on this subject, it is not necessary to argue the proposition that the mere assertion of a title to land derived to the plaintiffs, under and by virtue of a patent granted by the United States, presents no question which, of itself, confers jurisdiction on a Circuit Court of the United States. Blackburn v. Portland Gold Mining Co., \n175 U.S. 571\n.'\n\n The subject is discussed and cogent reasons for the rule are given in Shulthis v. McDougal, \n225 \nU.S. 561, 569\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 704. See, also, Taylor v. Anderson, \n234 U.S. 74\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 724; Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, \n177 U.S. 505\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 726; De Lamar's Nevada Co. v. Nesbitt, \n177 U.S. 523\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 715.\n Had the bill of complaint in this case averred that the suit arose under the laws of the United States, because \n\n[264 U.S. 16, 21]\n\u00a0\n Hannah Barnett insisted that her deed to Sims was void under the statutes of the United States, and so had created a cloud upon complainant's title by her subsequent leases and contracts, the District Court could have taken jurisdiction on that ground alone. Hopkins v. Walker, \n244 \nU.S. 486, 490\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 711; Lancaster v. Kathleen, \n241 U.S. 551\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 711; Wilson Cypress Co. v. Del Pozo, \n236 \nU.S. 635, 643\n, 644 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 446. But nothing of this kind appeared in the bill, and the development of the real federal issues in the answer or on the trial could not supply the defect in the original jurisdiction of the suit as one arising under the laws of the United States.\n It being established that the sole ground for jurisdiction in the District Court was diverse citizenship, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming the decree of the District Court on appeal, was final ( section 128, Judicial Code [Comp. St.  1120]), and can only be reviewed in this court by writ of certiorari under section 240, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1217). Schulthis v. McDougal, \n225 U.S. 561\n, 32 Sup.

Tax Commission, No. 5, 45 S. Ct. 80, 69 L. Ed. --, just decided.\n This Article1 provides that for the privilege of doing business in the State a foreign manufacturing and mercantile corporation shall pay, in advance, an annual franchise tax, to be computed by the State Tax Commission, at the rate of three per centum, upon the net income of the corporation for the preceding year.  209,2 215. This net income is 'presumably the same' as that upon which the corporation is required to pay a tax to the United States, section 209; but the amount thereof as returned to the United States is subject to any correction for fraud, evasion or errors, ascertained by the Commission, section 214. If the entire business of the corporation is not transacted \n\n[266 U.S. 271, 278]\n\u00a0\n within the State, the tax is to be based upon the portion of such ascertained net income determined by the proportion which the aggregate value of specified classes of the assets of the corporation within the State bears to the aggregate value of all such classes of assets wherever located. The classes of assets which are to enter into this ratio- hereinafter termed the segregated assets-are: Real property and tangible personal property; bills and accounts receivable resulting from the manufacture and sale of merchandise and services performed; and shares of stock owned in other corporations, not exceeding ten per centum of the real and tangible personal property, which are to be allocated according to the location of the physical property representing such stock. Section 214.3 The corporation is to be exempt from any personal property tax. Section 219-j.\n Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Limited, is a British corporation, engaged in brewing and selling Bass's ale. All its brewing is done and a large part of its sales are made in England; but it formerly imported a portion of its product into the United States which it sold through branch offices \n\n[266 U.S. 271, 279]\n\u00a0\n located in New York City and in Chicago. On its report to the New York Tax Commission-amended under protest-the Commission computed and assessed its franchise tax for the year commencing November 1, 1918. At a hearing granted on an application for revision, the Commission adhered to the original assessment. The Company then paid the tax under protest. The determination of the Commission was subsequently confirmed, upon a writ of certiorari, by the Appellate Division of the certiorari, by the Appellate Division 189 N. Y. S. 952; and the order of that court was affirmed, upon appeal, by the Court of Appeals, 232 N. Y. 42, 133 N. E. 122. The record was remitted to the Supreme Court, to which this writ of error was directed. Hodges v. Snyder, \n261 \nU.S. 600\n, 43 S. Ct. 435.\n It is undisputed that for the year preceding that for which this franchise tax was assessed, the Company, as reported to the United States, had no net income upon which it was subject to a Federal income tax. Its total net income, however, from all its business wherever carried on, was $ 2,185,600.4 The value of its segregated assets, wherever located, was: real property, $785,675; tangible personal property, $2,105,105; bills and accounts, $321,625; and shares of stock of other corporations, $845,195. Limiting the value of the shares of stock to ten per centum of the aggregate real and tangible personal property, that is, to $289,078, made the aggregate value of its segregated property, wherever located, $3,501, 483. The value of its segregated assets in New York was as follows: bills and accounts, $20,449; and tangible personal property, $23,668. This made the aggregate value of its segregated property in New York, $44,177. Taking the entire net income, $2,185,600, as the basis for the assessment of the tax, the Commission allocated to New York \n\n[266 U.S. 271, 280]\n\u00a0\n the proportion thereof which the segregated assets in New York bore to the segregated assets wherever located, amounting to $27,537.68; and upon this sum computed the franchise tax, at the rate of three per centum, that is, $ 826.14.\n The Company contends that this tax is not based upon any net income derived from the business which it carried on in New York but upon a portion of its net income derived from business carried on outside of the United States which under the provisions of the statute has been arbitrarily allocated to its New York business, and that such imposition of the tax deprives it of its property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and imposes a direct burden upon its foreign commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n\n 1. \nWe see no reason to doubt the accuracy of the statement made by the Court of Appeals in the present case that the franchise tax imposed by the statute is 'primarily a tax levied for the privilege of doing business in the State.' It is not a direct tax upon the allocated income of the corporation in a given year, but a tax for the privilege of doing business in one year measured by the allocated income accruing from the business in the preceding year. See New York v. Jersawit, \n263 \nU.S. 493, 496\n, 44 S. Ct. 167.\n\n 2. \nThe question of the constitutionality of this tax as applied in the present case is controlled, in its essential aspects, by the decision in Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 120\n, 41 S. Ct. 45. There the Connecticut statute imposed upon foreign corporations doing business partly within and partly without the State an annual tax of two per cent upon the net income earned during the preceding year on business carried on within the State, ascertained by taking such proportion of the whole net income on which the corporation was required to pay a \n\n[266 U.S. 271, 281]\n\u00a0\n tax to the United States as the value of its real and tangible personal property within the State bore to the value of all of its real and tangible personal property. The Underwood Typewriter Co., a Delaware corporation, was engaged in manufacturing and selling typewriters and supplies. All its manufacturing was done in Connecticut, but the greater part of its sales was made from branch offices in other States. It contended that the tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce; and that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment in that it imposed, directly or indirectly, a tax on income arising from business conducted outside of the State. In support of the latter objection it showed that while 47 per cent. of its real estate and tangible personal property was located in Connecticut, resutling, under the method of apportionment of the net income required by the statute, in attributing 47 per cent. of its total net income to the operations in Connecticut, in fact about $1,300, 000 of its net profits were received in other States and only about $43, 000 in Connecticut. The court, in sustaining the validity of the tax, said:\n'But this showing wholly fails to sustain the objection. The profits of the corporation were largely earned by a series of transactions beginning with manufacture in Connecticut and ending with sale in other States. In this it was typical of a large part of the manufacturing business conducted in the State. The legislature in attempting to put upon this business its fair share of the burden of taxation was faced with the impossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the processes conducted within its borders. It, therefore, adopted a method of apportionment which, for all that appears in the record, reached, and was meant to reach, only the profits earned within the State. 'The plaintiff's argument on this branch of the case,' as stated by the Supreme Court of Errors, 'carries the burden of showing that 47 per cent. of its net income is not reasonably \n\n[266 U.S. 271, 282]\n\u00a0\n attributable, for purposes of taxation, to the manufacture of products from the sale of which 80 per cent. of its gross earnings was derived after paying manufacturing costs.' The corporation has not even attempted to show this; and for aught that appears the percentage of net profits earned in Connecticut may have been much larger than 47 per cent. There is, consequently, nothing in this record to show that the method of apportionment adopted by the State was inherently arbitrary, or that its application to this corporation produced an unreasonable result.'\n\n So in the present case we are of opinion that as the Company carried on the unitary business of manufacturing and selling ale, in which its profits were earned by a series of transactions beginning with the manufacture in England and ending in sales in New York and other places- the process of manufacturing resulting in no profits until it ends in sales-the State was justified in attributing to New York a just proportion of the profits earned by the Company from such unitary business. In Wallace v. Hines, \n253 \nU.S. 66, 69\n, 40 S. Ct. 435, 436 (64 L. Ed. 782) it was recognized that a State in imposing an excise tax upon foreign corporations in respect to doing business within the State, may look to the property of such corporations beyond its borders to 'get the true value of the things within it, when they are part of an organic system of wide extent,' giving the local property a value above that which it would otherwise possess, and may therefore take into account property situated elsewhere when it 'can be seen in some plain and fairly intelligible way that it adds to the value of the [property] and the rights exercised in the State.' This is directly applicable to the carrying on of a unitary business of manufacture and sale partly within and partly without the State.\n Nor do we find that the method of apportioning the net income on the basis of the ratio of the segregated \n\n[266 U.S. 271, 283]\n\u00a0\n assets located in New York and elsewhere, was inherently arbitrary or a mere effort to reach profits earned elsewhere under the guise of legitimate taxation. The principal factors entering into this allocation are, as in the Underwood Case, the real and tangible personal property of the corporation. We see nothing arbitrary in also including bills and accounts receivable resulting from the manufacture and sale of merchandise and services performed, or in taking average monthly values as the measure of all the segregated assets except shares of stock. And in the present case the inclusion of a portion of the shares of stock in other corporations-none of which were allocated to New York-resulted in the Company's favor, and reduced the income allocated to New York to less than it otherwise would have been.\n It is not shown in the present case, any more than in the Underwood Case, that this application of the statutory method of apportionment has produced an unreasonable result. The fact that the Company may not have had any net income upon which it was subject to payment of income tax to the Federal Government, obviously does not show that it received no net income from the business which it carried on in New York. There is no evidence in the record as to whether the Company received any net income from its New York business, or the amount of the profit and loss on that business, if any, either considered separately or in connection with the manufacturing business carried on in Great Britain. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 271, 284]\n\u00a0\n 3. Furthermore, the statutory method of apportionment not being shown to be arbitrary or unreasonable, we think that the Court of Appeals rightly held that the tax imposed for the carrying on of the business in New York is not invalid merely because in the preceding year the business conducted in New York may have yielded no net income. There is no sufficient reason why a foreign corporation desiring the continue the carrying on of business in the State for another year-from which it expects to derive a benefit-should be relieved of a privilege tax because it did not happen to have made any profit during the preceding year. This is especially true where, as in the present case, the corporation is entirely relieved of any personal property tax. See U. S. Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335, 346\n, 32 S. Ct. 211.\n\n 4. \nThe Company furthermore urges that in any event it should have been permitted to include in the statutory ratio the entire value of the stocks which it owned in other corporations. This contention is based upon the fact that in the previous case of People v. Knapp, 230 N. Y. 48, 129 N. E. 202, it had been held that in so far as the statute provided that in the allocation of income the value of stocks of other corporations should not be taken into consideration beyond ten per cent. of the real and tangible personal property, although the entire dividend from such stocks was included in the net income which was the basis of the allocation, the statute was unconstitutional, and that the taxpayer in such case should be permitted to include in the statutory allocation the entire value of the stocks which it owned in other corporations. As to this matter it is sufficient to say that it does not appear from the record in the present case that the shares of stock which the Company owned in other corporations had yielded any dividends which were included in its total net income; and further, that this question, so far \n\n[266 U.S. 271, 285]\n\u00a0\n as appears from the record, was not raised by the Company either before the Commission or the State courts, in each of which its objections to the validity of the tax were phrased in terms having no reference to this specific question. And not having been raised in the Court of Appeals or passed on by that court, it is not a question which can now be reviewed by this Court under an assignment of errors raising it here for the first time.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Consol.

The District Court, finding that the membership was property and under the rules of the board passed to the trustee in bankruptcy free of all claims of the members, ordered that it be held for transfer and sale for the benefit of the general creditors.\n The case presents two questions:\n First-Had the District Court jurisdiction to deal with the case by summary proceeding?\n Second-If the District Court had such jurisdiction, was its decree right upon the merits?\n The petition and amendment of the trustee asked that the Board of Trade and certain members be required to show cause why the trustee's right to the membership of the bankrupt should not be recognized by the Board of Trade, so as to permit its transfer and sale. Pleas to the jurisdiction, with special appearances, were filed by the respondents, alleging that the membership was not property, or capable of being treated as an asset of the bankrupt, that transfer of it had been duly objected to by respondents as members, and that they had adverse claims creating a controversy which the District Court under paragraphs 'a' and 'b' of section 23 of the Bankrupt Law (Comp. St.  9607) was denied jurisdiction to hear. The pleas were overruled. Reserving the question of jurisdiction, the Board of Trade filed an answer, which the other respondents adopted. The cause was heard upon the petition, its amendment, and the answer, which disclosed the following: \n\n[264 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n Wilson F. Henderson, the bankrupt, a citizen of Chicago, was admitted to membership in the Board of Trade in 1899, and for many months prior to March 1, 1919, was president and one of the principal stockholders in a corporation known as Lipsey & Co., and actively engaged in making contracts on its behalf for present and future delivery of grain on the Board of Trade. In March, 1919, Lipsey & Co. became insolvent and ceased to transact business, being then indebted to 30 or more members of the exchange on its contracts in an aggregate amount of more than $60,000. A corporation is not admitted to membership of the board, but under the rules it may do business on the exchange, if two of its executive officers, substantial stockholders, are members in good standing and give its name as principal in their contracts. The rules further provide that, if the corporation is accepted as a party to a contract and fails to comply with any of its obligations under the rules, its officers as members are subject to the same discipline as if they had failed to comply with an obligation of their own.\n Any male person of good character and credit and of legal age, after his name has been duly posted for 10 days, may be admitted to membership in the Board of Trade by 10 votes of the Board of Directors, provided that 3 votes are not cast against him, and that he pays an initiation fee of $ 25,000, or presents 'an unimpaired or unforfeited membership duly transferred,' and signs 'an agreement to abide by the rules, regulations and by-laws of the association.' The rules further provide that a member, if he has paid all assessments and has no outstanding claims held against him by members, and the membership is not in any way impaired or forfeited, may, upon payment of a fee of $250, transfer his membership to any person eligible to membership, approved by the board, after 10 days' posting, both of the proposed transfer and of the name of substitute. \n\n[264 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n No rule exists giving to the Board of Trade or its members the right to compel sale or other disposition of memberships to pay debts. The only right of one member against another in securing payment of an obligation is to prevent the transfer of the membership of the debtor member by filing objection to such transfer with the directors.\n The membership of Henderson was worth $10,500 on January 24, 1920, when the petition in bankruptcy was filed against him. All assessments then due had been paid, and the membership was not in any way impaired and forfeited. On May 1, 1919, Henderson had posted on the bulletin of the exchange a notice and application for a transfer of his membership. Within 10 days, two objections were filed, one of them on account of a debt due from Lipsey & Co. The objections were withdrawn, however, in December, 1919. On January 29, 1920, however, 5 days after the petition in bankruptcy was filed, members, creditors of Lipsey & Co. on its defaulted contracts signed by Henderson, lodged with the directors objections to the transfer. These objectors were respondents in the District Court and are petitioners here.\n Under paragraph 'a,' section 70, of the Bankrupt Law of July 1, 1898 ( chapter 541, 30 Stat. 565 [Comp. St.  9654]), the trustee takes the title of the bankrupt (3) to 'powers which he might have exercised for his own benefit' and (5) to 'property which prior to the filing of the petition he could by any means have transferred or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him.' Petitioners insist that the membership is not property within (5). The Supreme Court of Illinois, from which state this Board of Trade derives its charter, has held in Barclay v. Smith, 107 Ill. 349, 47 Am. Rep. 437, that the membership is not property, or subject to judicial sale, basing its conclusion on the ground that it cannot be acquired, except upon a vote of ten directors, \n\n[264 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n and cannot be transferred to another, unless the transfer is approved by the same vote, and that it cannot be subjected to the payment of debts of the holder by legal proceedings. It is not possible to reconcile Barclay v. Smith with the decisions of this court. In Hyde v. Woods, \n94 U.S. 523\n, the bankrupt was a member of the San Francisco Stock and Exchange Board, a voluntary association with an elective membership, and with a right in each member to sell his seat subject to an election by the directors of the vendee as a member. This court held the membership to be an incorporeal right and property, which would pass to the trustee of the bankrupt, subject to the rules of the board, which required first the payment of all debts due to the members. In Sparhawk v. Yerkes, \n142 U.S. 1\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 104, the conclusion in Hyde v. Woods was reaffirmed in respect of seats in the Stock Exchanges of New York and Philadelphia, which were then voluntary unincorporated associations, with the same provision as to membership and preference for the debts of member creditors. In Page v. Edmunds, \n187 U.S. 596\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 200, the question was whether a seat of a bankrupt in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange was property passing to the trustee under subdivision 5 of section 70 of the Bankrupt Act. In that association, no member could sell his seat if he had unsettled claims on the exchange. In case of insolvency, the seat could be sold, and the proceeds distributed to the member creditors. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had held, just as in this case the Supreme Court of Illinois has held, that such membership was not property, and could not be seized in execution for debts of its holder. Thompson v. Adams, 93 Pa. 55; Pancoast v. Gowen, 93 Pa. 66. These were the cases relied on by the Supreme Court of Illinois to sustain its view. Referring to the Pennsylvania decisions in Page v. Edmunds (\n187 U.S. 603\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 203), this court said:\n'It is not certain whether the learned court intended to say that the seat was not property at all, or not property \n\n[264 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n because it could not be seized in execution for debts. If the former, we cannot concur. The facts of this case demonstrate the contrary. If the latter, it does not affect the pending controversy. The power of the appellant to transfer it was sufficient to vest it in his trustee.'\n\n The court thus held that the question was to be determined by reference to the language of the Bankrupt Act and that the seat was property, 'which prior to the filing of the petition he [the bankrupt] could by any means have transferred.' It declined to limit in the definition of property under subdivision (5) to such as the state courts might hold could be seized in execution by judicial process. Subdivision ( 3), vesting in the trustee title to powers which the bankrupt might exercise for his own benefit, manifests a purpose to make the assets of the estate broadly inclusive. By a construction not unduly strained, subdivision (3) might be held to include a power to transfer a seat on the Exchange, subject to its rules, if it were necessary.\n In Citizens' National Bank v. Durr, \n257 U.S. 99\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 15, we held, following the Hyde, Sparhawk, and Page Cases, supra, that membership in the New York Stock Exchange was personal property, whose situs followed that of the owner and was taxable where he was domiciled.\n Congress derives its power to enact a bankrupt law from the federal Constitution and the construction of it is a federal question. Of course, where the Bankrupt Law deals with property rights which are regulated by the state law, the federal courts in bankruptcy will follow the state courts; but when the language of Congress indicates a policy requiring a broader construction of the statute than the state decisions would give it, federal courts cannot be concluded by them. Board of Trade v. Weston, 243 Fed. 332, 156 C. C. A. 112.\n Counsel for petitioners urges that the Hyde, Sparhawk, and Page Cases differ from the one before us, in that the \n\n[264 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n rules of the associations there under consideration provided specifically for a sale of the seat and a preferred distribution of the proceeds to the creditor members, whereas here there is no sale provided for at all at the instance of the board or its members who are creditors. Their only protection is in the power to prevent a transfer as long as the member's obligations to them are unperformed. We do not think this makes a real difference in the character of the property which the member has in his seat. He can transfer it or sell it, subject to a right of his creditors to prevent his transfer or sale till he settles with them, a right in some respects similar to the typical lien of the common law defined as 'a right in one man to retain that which is in his possession belonging to another till certain demands of him, the person in possession, are satisfied.' Hammond v. Barclay, 2 East, 235; Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 620. The right of the objecting creditor members differs, however, from the common-law lien, in that the latter, to exist and be effective, must deprive the owner of possession and enjoyment, whereas the former is consistent with possession and personal enjoyment by the owner and only interferes with and prevents alienation.\n We are brought, then, to the contention that petitioners are adverse claimants and are entitled to be heard in a plenary suit. This turns on the question who has in possession of the seat. If the bankrupt was in possession when the petition in bankruptcy was filed, then the authorities leave no doubt that the possession passes to the trustee, and that his possession justifies the District Court in determining the validity of the liens claimed in a summary proceeding by a rule to show cause against the claimants. Hebert v. Crawford, \n228 U.S. 204\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 484; Babbitt v. Dutcher, \n216 U.S. 102\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 372, 17 Ann. Cas. 969; Murphy v. John Hoffman Co., \n211 U.S. 562\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 154; Lazarus v. Prentice, \n234 \nU.S. 263, 266\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 851; Clay v. Waters, 178 Fed. 385, 392, 101 C. C. A. 645, 21 Ann. Cas. 897. \n\n[264 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n The petitioners argue that a seat in the exchange, even if it be property, is incapable of manual possession, that it is really only a chose in action, and that the bankrupt or his trustee is no more in actual possession of it for the purposes of summary jurisdiction than the trustee would be in manual possession of a debt, to enforce the payment of which the trustee must certainly bring a plenary action against the resisting debtor. Membership on the Board of Trade is different from a mere chose in action, like a simple claim or debt asserted against another, and only to be enjoyed after its satisfaction enforcement. It is a continuously enjoyed 'incorporeal right.' Hyde v. Woods, supra. The Board of Trade is the member's trustee, while it maintains and holds all its facilities for his use and enjoyment. As long as he has these, he may properly be said to be in possession of them. That creditor members may assert a mere restraint of alienation to enforce their claims does not oust the member's possession or personal enjoyment. By operation of the Bankrupt Law the membership passes, subject to rules of the exchange, to the trustee for his disposition of it. The trustee does not become a member, but he does come into control of the bankrupt's right to dispose of the membership, and with the aid of the bankruptcy court can require the bankrupt to do everything on his part necessary under the rules of the board to exercise this right. The membership is property in a way attached to the person of the bankrupt and disposable only by his will. It follows him, therefore, into the bankruptcy court, which is given full equitable jurisdiction over his conduct in respect of his estate, and therefore comes into the custody of that court to be administered by it as part of his estate.\n The board is not in an adverse attitude toward the bankrupt. It holds the membership for the bankrupt in conformity to the rules as to his enjoyment and disposition \n\n[264 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n of it. We think that the principle of Bryan v. Bernheimer, \n181 U.S. 188\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 557, Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 U.S. 1\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 269, and Whitney v. Wenman, \n198 U.S. 539\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 778, applies here, and that within those cases the seat is held by the board for the bankrupt, and that in bankruptcy the right to dispose of it under the rules passes into the control, and therefore into the possession, of the trustee.\n A similar question was before the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in O'Dell v. Boyden, 150 Fed. 731, 80 C. C. A. 397, 10 Ann. Cas. 239. The membership was in the New York Stock Exchange, personal to the holder, and only to be transferred, under the rules of the exchange and by consent of its committee on admissions, to a new member satisfactory to them. It was held that in bankruptcy the membership passed into possession of the trustee as assets of the estate, and that, being thus in the custody of the court, the claim of one to whom the owner of the seat had previously made an assignment of it to secure a debt was to be settled in a summary proceeding in the bankruptcy court. Judge Lurton, afterwards a justice of this court, in passing on the question of possession said (150 Fed. 737, 80 C. C. A. 403, 10 Ann. Cas. 239):\n'The 'seat' or 'membership' continued to be the 'seat' of Henrotin [ the bankrupt], and was a pecuniary asset which passed to his trustee. It was as much in his custody and possession as such a species of property is capable of. ... Only through a court of equity can the pecuniary value of such an asset be realized to creditors or assignees. Only by decree in personam compelling the bankrupt member can such a transfer of membership be effectuated as will put the buyer in the place of Henrotin as a member. Over him for that purpose the bankrupt court has exclusive control, and in this sense, also, may it be said that the 'seat' or 'membership' was in custodia legis when the trustee sought the aid of the court to adjudicate the claims and liens asserted by O'Dell.' \n\n[264 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n See, also, In re Hoey (C. C. A.) 290 Fed. 116; Orinoco Iron Co. v. Metzel, 230 Fed. 40, 144 C. C. A. 338.\n\n For the reasons given, we hold that the District Court had jurisdiction to determine the issues arising in respect to the membership by summary proceeding.\n This brings us to the merits. The District Court ordered the transfer and sale of the seat free from all the claims and objections of the petitioners. The view of the court was that, because Henderson had duly posted his intention to transfer in May, 1919, and all the objections of creditor members then filed against such transfer had been settled or withdrawn before the petition in bankruptcy was filed against him, the right of the member creditors to object to the transfer had been lost. The rule which is applicable (section 2 of rule X) reads in part as follows:\n'Every member shall be entitled to transfer his membership when he has paid all assessments due, and has against him no outstanding unadjusted or unsettled claims or contracts held by members of this association, and said membership is not in any way impaired or forfeited, upon payment of two hundred and fifty dollars, to any person eligible to membership who may be approved for membership by the board of directors, after due notice by posting as provided in section 1 of this rule. ... Prior to the transfer of any membership, application for such transfer shall be posted upon the bulletin of the exchange for at least ten days, when, if no objection is made, it shall be assumed the member has no outstanding claims against him.'\n\n We do not think these last words are intended to operate as a statute of limitations against the making of objections before the board of directors to such a transfer after the 10 days. The effect of the rule is to warrant the directors in proceeding after the 10 days to effectuate the transfer on the assumption that no one entitled \n\n[264 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n opposes it, and if the transfer is completed before objection, those who have been silent are, or course, estopped; but if, at any time before the director's act, otherwise valid objections are brought to their attention, it is too drastic a construction to hold that delay for 10 days after notice has worked a forfeiture. To give the rule such a meaning, the intent should be more clearly expressed. The objections of most of the petitioners herein were filed within 5 days after the petition in bankruptcy, and the board never has acted on the application for transfer. The objections are therefore valid.\n The claims of the petitioners are also attacked on the ground that they were debts of Lipsey & Co. and not of Henderson, the bankrupt. There is nothing in this. The rules make the agent of a corporation who is a member and does business and makes contracts in its name on the exchange subject to discipline for a default in the obligations of the corporation. This impairs the membership of the agent and prevents transfer under section 2, rule 10.\n Nor is there any weight to the argument that as the preference claims of petitioners were not asserted until after bankruptcy proceedings were begun, the transfer to the trustee was rendered free from their objection. Such a claim was negatived in Hyde v. Woods, supra. The preference of the member creditors is not created after bankruptcy. The lien, if it can be called such, is inherent in the property in its creation, and it can be asserted at any time before actual transfer. Indeed, the danger of bankruptcy of the member is perhaps the chief reason, and a legitimate one, for creating the lien.\n We think, therefore, that the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals erred on the merits of the case. The claims of the petitioners amount to more than $60,000, and these must be satisfied before the trustee can realize anything on the transfer of the seat for the general estate. \n\n[264 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals and the District Court are reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court, to proceed in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRADY v. WORK(1924)\nNo. 121\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. S. M. Stockslager, of Washington, D. C., for appellant. \n\n[263 U.S. 435, 436]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a bill in equity in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, brought by Thomas N. Brady against the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the Land Office, seeking to enjoin them from issuing a patent to one Lillie S. Harner for a homestead.\n The bill avers that William Rattkamner in 1913 made a homestead entry of certain public land in Arizona; that in October, 1915, Harry S. Harner filed a contest against the entry; that Rattkamner made no answer; that the register and receiver of local land office canceled the entry and awarded a preference right to Harner, December 27, 1918; that on January 1 the plaintiff herein, Brady, made a homestead entry of the land, and moved onto the land; that Harner made not entry under his preference right; that in February, 1919, one Rudolph Larson illegally made a homestead entry of the land; that Brady, the plaintiff, filed a contest; that Lillie S. Harner, deserted wife of Harry S. Harner, intervened in the same proceeding; that on the hearing the register and receiver recommended that Larson's entry be canceled, and that Lillie S. Harner be allowed to enter; that this was appealed from to the Commissioner of the Land Office, who affirmed the action of the register and receiver; and that thereafter Brady filed a petition for a rehearing before the Secretary of the Interior, which was denied.\n The bill avers that the register and receiver, as well as the Commissioner of the Land Office and the Secretary of the Interior, violated the provisions of the Act of May 14, 1880, entitled 'An act for the relief of settlers on public lands' (21 Stat. 140, c. 89 [Comp. St.  4536-4538]), and were without authority in deciding in favor of Lillie S. Harner and proposing to issue a patent to her. \n\n[263 U.S. 435, 437]\n\u00a0\n The prayer is for an injunction against the issuing of the proposed patent by the defendants.\n The defendants moved to dismiss the bill on the ground that it asked the court to control the defendants in matters involving exercise of the judgment and discretion vested in them by law, and also on the ground that Lillie S. Harner was an indispensable party to this suit. This motion was granted by the Supreme Court of the District on both grounds, and that action was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n We think the motion was properly sustained on the second ground and do not find it necessary to discuss the first. Lillie S. Harner is the person whom the administrative officers of the government have held to be entitled to a patent for this land. Clearly the controversy between the plaintiff and those officers involving the granting of a patent to her cannot be settled without her presence in court. New Mexico v. Lane, \n243 \nU.S. 52, 58\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 348; Litchfield v.Register & Receiver, 9 Wall, 575, 578. She is entitled to be heard. Inability to secure service on her because she lives in Arizona cannot dispense with the necessity of making her a party.\n Dismissal was asked also on the ground that no appeal lies in a case like this from the District Court of Appeals to this court and that we thus have no jurisdiction. We think, however, that the bill disclosed a case in which the construction and application of the Act of May 14, 1880, was drawn in question by the defendant. By the sixth paragraph of section 250 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1227) we are required to hear an appeal in such a case.\n We, therefore, cannot dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction, but can and do affirm the action of the District Court of Appeals in affirming the decree of the Supreme Court of the District in dismissing the bill for lack of an indispensable party.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROOKS-SCANLON CORPORATION v. U S(1924)\nNo. 367\nArgued: January 8, 1924Decided: May 12, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Junell, of Minneapolis, Minn., and Jackson H. Ralston, of Washington, D. C., for Brooks-Scanlon Corporation.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Henry M. Ward, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n\n[265 U.S. 106, 114]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case arises out of the exertion of the power of requisition conferred on the President by chapter 29, 40 Stat. 182, approved June 15, 1917, known as the Emergency Shipping Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/16 d).1 There is involved the question whether \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 115]\n\u00a0\n a certain contract for the construction of a ship was requisitioned, and, if it was, upon what basis is just compensation to be ascertained.\n The act empowered the President (a) to order from any person for government use ships or ship material of kind and quantity usually produced by such person; (b) to requisition contracts for the building of ships; (c) to require the owner of any shipbuilding plant to place at the disposal of the United States the whole or any part of the output of the plant; (d) to requisition any shipbuilding plant or part thereof; (e) to requisition any ship in process of construction; and compliance with all orders issued under the act was made obligatory. By executive order of July 11, 1917, he delegated these powers to the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation. On August 3, 1917, the claimant was the assignee \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 116]\n\u00a0\n and owner of a contract by which the New York Shipbuilding Corporation agreed to construct a ship, known as hull No. 193. The contract was made March 28, 1916, and after some modification it provided for the construction of a ship of 8,597 deadweight tons, to be completed and delivered on or before February 1, 1918. The contract price was $831,630.\n Prior to August 3, 1917, the claimant or its assignor had secured the services of an architect, furnished plans and specifications to the builder, employed a bureau to inspect the work as it progressed, and had paid to the builder on account of the contract price installments amounting to $419,500, which with interest paid, architect's fees and the value of the plans and specifications, amounted to $473,710.58, exclusive of the cost of inspection.\n Immediately after the execution of the contract, the builder ordered all materials required, for which sufficient data then existed, and, before August 3, 1917, completed its orders for substantially all that were needed to perform the contract. Between 35 and 40 per cent. of the required materials had been delivered to the builder ready for use, and, on that date, the ship was about 19 per cent. completed. The Court of Claims found that all materials so ordered were delivered at the prices fixed in the orders and were used in the construction of the ship, and that nothing was purchased after that date, except materials used for construction, at a cost of $31,000, ordered for military protection. At that time claimant held on deposit in various solvent banks a sum of money sufficient to pay all the remaining installments of the contract price, and the builder was ready and willing to perform the contract.\n On August 3, 1917, the Emergency Fleet Corporation served on the builder its order and notice requisitioning all of the ships, including hull No. 193, under construction in \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 117]\n\u00a0\n the builder's shipyard, and the materials necessary for their completion. The order required the builder to complete the ships. It stated that compensation would be paid for 'ships, materials and contracts requisitioned.' The builder was required to furnish plans and specifications of the requisitioned ships, and a statement of the payments made and amounts still due, and other information 'necessary to a fair and just determination of the obligations of the Emergency Fleet Corporation in taking over these ships and contracts.'\n On August 22, the Fleet Corporation caused its district officer to deliver to the builder a formal written notice, which recited that the ships had been requisitioned, and that an order had been given the builder to complete them, and ordered the builder to 'proceed ... in conformity with the requirements of the contract, plans and specifications under which construction proceeded prior to the requisition of August 3, 1917 . ...' and stated:\n'For the work of completion heretofore and herein ordered the corporation will pay to you amounts equal to payments set forth in the contract and not yet paid. ...'\n\n The builder accepted the order. The Fleet Corporation gave directions to the claimant not to make, and to the builder not to accept from claimant, any further payments on account of the contract.\n On August 28, the Fleet Corporation notified the claimant that it had issued to the builder notice of requisition, and inclosed a copy. The letter advised that the Fleet Corporation's district officer had been authorized to take over claimant's inspection officers. It requested a verified statement of the payments made to the builder prior to requisition. It said:\n'It is the present intention of the corporation to reimburse you promptly, so far as funds are available, for the payments heretofore made to the shipbuilder if ... such payments are found in order and in conformity with the contract requirements.'\n\n In requested \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 118]\n\u00a0\n a statement of indirect expenditures, such as the cost of superintendence, original design and interest on funds already paid, and said that the owner might submit any other matters deemed pertinent; that it presumed that it was addressing those entitled to receive compensation on account of the requisition of the vessels, and asked that there be included in claimant's answer 'all evidence of ownership which is necessary to establish the right of those who are entitled to receive the compensation provided by law.'\n On December 8, 1917, the Fleet Corporation made a contract with the builder and the American International Corporation relating to the completion and disposal of hull No. 193 and other ships requisitioned. It required the builder to complete the ship 'in accordance with the specifications annexed to the respective contracts under which such hulls were being constructed for the former owners prior to August 3, 1917. ...' It also provided that the Fleet Corporation should have credit for all sums theretofore received by the builder from former owners. The Fleet Corporation agreed to indemnify the builder from all loss or liability arising out of claims of the former owners occasioned by the requisition order, or any subsequent acts or orders.\n January 23, 1920, the Fleet Corporation awarded claimant $442,683.82 as just compensation. It paid the builder for construction of the ship $ 412,130, which, added to the award, makes $854,813.82. This would be the total cost to it of the ship, if its award as to compensation were accepted. The contract price was $831,630. The cost of construction for military protection was $31,000. The Court of Claims found that at the time of the requisition, the value of such ships was $200 per deadweight ton, and was the same on February 1, 1918. The Court of Claims also found that claimant had paid to the builder $239,500 in cash, $180,000 in notes, and $28,433.33 interest on notes, \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 119]\n\u00a0\n making $447,933.33, and that it also paid architect's fees amounting to $5, 500, and furnished plans and specifications of the value of $20,277.25, making in all $473,710.58. The amount of the award was unsatisfactory to claimant, and 75 per cent. of it, $332,012.87, was paid. The judgment was for $231,549.12.2\n Both parties appeal.\n Did the United States requisition claimant's contract?\n The act of Congress conferred upon the President the power to take claimant's contract, and also to take the ship materials and the ship in process of construction. It required compliance with all orders issued under it. No question is raised or involved as to the obligation of the builder to comply with orders given it to complete the ship in accordance with the contract. It was ordered to do so, and it accepted the order. We are not here concerned with \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 120]\n\u00a0\n its rights or obligations, but the orders given the builder show that expropriation of claimant's contract and rights was intended. By its orders it put itself in the shoes of claimant and took from claimant and appropriated to the use of the United States all the rights and advantages that an assignee of the contract would have had. The credit for, and advantages under the contract resulting from, payment of $419,500, made by claimant to builder were taken. The use of the plans and specifications for the construction of the ship as well as the benefit of inspection prior to the requisition date, August 3, 1917, were also taken over. The contract was not terminated. The direct and immediate result of the requisition orders and acts of the Fleet Corporation was to take from claimant its contract and its rights thereunder. Because of material ordered and furnished and work performed prior to requisition, the United States was enabled to obtain the ship earlier than it could have caused a like ship to have been planned and built, and secured the benefit of prices prevailing immediately after the making of the contract, when the builder ordered materials for the construction of the ship. At the time of requisition, costs were higher than the contract prices. At that time, and on February 1, 1918, the date fixed for completion, the value of such ships was greatly in excess of the contract price, and in excess of the amount awarded to claimant plus the amount paid by the Fleet Corporation to the builder.\n Omnia Company v. United States, \n261 U.S. 502\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 437, does not support the contention that claimant's contract was not expropriated. There, claimant had a contract giving it an opportunity to purchase a large quantity of steel plate from a steel company at a price under the market. If the contract had been carried out, large profits would have resulted. Before any deliveries were made, the United States requisitioned the steel company's entire production of steel plate. No specific steel plate had been \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 121]\n\u00a0\n appropriated to the contract, and no part of the purchase price had been paid. The action taken by the United States applied to the steel company only and created no relations with the claimant. The contract was not kept alive nor resorted to in order to determine anything involved in the transaction between the United States and the steel company; the benefit of the low prices was not taken; no payments made on account of the purchase price were taken; nothing belonging to the Omnia Company was taken. Damages claimed were held too remote. The differences between that case and this are essential and obvious.\n The situation in this case is well stated in the dissenting opinion of the Chief Justice of the Court of Claims:\n'If the plaintiff had voluntarily assigned its contract with the builder to the government, and the latter had expressly assumed the unfulfilled obligations and later received the completed vessel, it would not more effectively have acquired plaintiff's contract, its rights, and obligations than actually resulted from what was done in this case. The government requisitioned the incomplete vessel with the purpose of requiring the completion in accordance with the existing contract; it did require the carrying out of that contract ( with slight modifications); it took plaintiff's right to have the vessel; it received the vessel and appropriated plaintiff's partial payments thereon to its own use and benefit.'\n\n It must be held that the claimant's contract, and its rights and interests thereunder, were expropriated.\n Upon what basis is just compensation to be ascertained?\n The expropriation enabled the Fleet Corporation to obtain the ship when completed by paying the builder the installments of the contract price remaining unpaid at the time of the requisition. The builder was not entitled to more, because the Fleet Corporation took over the contract and succeeded to the rights of claimant. \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 122]\n\u00a0\n The award by the Fleet Corporation was made up of two items: One was stated to be the 'computed value' of material in the yard of the builder at the time of requisition, and the other the amount of progress payments 'in excess of the cost of the materials requisitioned.' The Court of Claims held that the materials were not the property of the claimant, but belonged to the builder, and should not have been taken into account in arriving at the compensation due the plaintiff. But we are of opinion that the amount of claimant's compensation did not depend upon the legal title to the materials during construction; that the progress payments did not constitute the amount claimant was entitled to have, and that the award was erroneous, because of failure to find the value of claimant's contract rights taken.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims was based upon the assumption that the money paid by claimant in furtherance of planning and building the ship was expropriated. In the opinion, it is said:\n'And the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amounts of money requisitioned and appropriated by the United States.'\n\n But plainly there was no requisition of money.\n The United States contends that nothing whatever was requisitioned from the plaintiff, and that the judgment should be reversed and the claim dismissed unless claimant shall be held entitled to compensation for cancellation of its contract, and that, in such event, it should have judgment only for an amount sufficient with what already has been paid to it to make up 'the amount actually invested in the ship taken.' \n3\n As we hold that claimant's contract rights were expropriated, it is not necessary to consider what would be just compensation in case of mere cancellation of the contract. \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 123]\n\u00a0\n The contract rights of claimant taken are to be distinguished from its expenditures for the production of the ship. The value of property may be greater or less than its cost; and this is true of contract rights and other intangibles as well as of physical things. It is the property and not the cost of it that is protected by the Fifth Amendment. The Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 454\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. By the taking, the claimant lost and the United States obtained the right to have the completed ship delivered to it on or before February 1, 1918, upon payment of the installments remaining to be paid under the contract. It is settled by the decisions of this court that just compensation is the value of the property taken at the time of the taking. Vogelstein & Co. v. United States, \n262 \nU.S. 337, 340\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 564; United States v. New River Collieries, \n262 \nU.S. 341, 344\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 565; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 306\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 354; Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 341\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 622. And, if the taking precedes the payment of compensation, the owner is entitled to such addition to the value at the time of the taking as will produce the full equivalent of such value paid contemporaneously. Interest at a proper rate is a good measure of the amount to be added. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United States, supra; United States v. Benedict \n261 \nU.S. 294, 298\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 357; United States v. Brown, \n263 U.S. 78\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 92, 68 L. Ed. --, decided November 12, 1923\n\n\n Claimant insists that just compensation is the value of the contract and its rights and interests thereunder, and is measured by the difference between the value of the ship, as found by the court, at the time of the taking and on the date specified for delivery, and the amount which claimant was then required under the contract to pay in order to get the ship.\n We think it not permissible so to calculate compensation. It is the sum which, considering all the circumstances-uncertainties of the war and the rest-probably \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 124]\n\u00a0\n could have been obtained for an assignment of the contract and claimant's rights thereunder; that is, the sum that would in all probability result from fair negotiations between an owner who is willing to sell and a purchaser who desires to buy.\n In re Mersey Docks and Admiralty Commissioners, \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 1920]\n\u00a0\n 3 K. B. 223, is a case quite similar to this. There, the admiralty requisitioned a barge nearing completion, altered her construction, and paid, or undertook to pay, the builder the original contract price. It was impossible for the board, for whom the barge was being constructed, to replace her by another at a cost less than three times the contract price of the original barge. By agreement, the ascertainment of compensation to be paid by the admiralty to the board was referred to an arbitrator. The board claimed the difference between the contract price and cost of replacing the barge, regard being had to the fact that replacement would be impossible for three years, and also claimed compensation for loss of services during the period required for replacement. The admiralty contended that the measure of compensation should be the difference between the contract price and value of the vessel when taken. A special case was stated by the arbitrator. The Earl of Reading, Lord Chief Justice, gave judgment, and held that the board was entitled to recover the difference between the contract price and the increased cost of replacing the barge; that the board was not entitled to any compensation for loss of services, the damage being too remote. He said (page 233):\n'On a broad view of the facts and without undue regard to minute details, the court has to determine upon what principle the compensation to be awarded to the board ought to be measured. In my judgment it is sufficient for the purpose of this case to say that the board are entitled to have the property which, but for the action of the admiralty, would have been in their possession in April, 1917, replaced by \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 125]\n\u00a0\n the admiralty. As it cannot be replaced except by the expenditure of money, they are entitled to the amount of money which will represent the cost to them of the replacement. This must be measured with regard to the special circumstances arising from the war and more especially to the increase in the value of labor and materials which has continued up to the present time. ... I can see no very material difference between the respective principles contended for by counsel on behalf of the board and counsel on behalf of the admiralty. In truth I think that both these principles lead to the same conclusion.'\n\n This court has held in many cases that replacement cost is to be considered in the ascertainment of value,4 but that it is not necessarily the sole measure of or guide to value. We are of opinion that value, so far as material, rather than replacement cost, should be taken into account, for the ascertainment of just compensation. If the ship had been complete and ready for delivery at the time of requisition, claimant's just compensation would be the value of the ship, less the unpaid balance of the contract price. But the ship was not ready, and the builder was not bound to deliver before February 1, 1918. Claimant had a right to its delivery at that time, and the builder was ready to perform the contract. The Court of Claims, being of opinion that claimant's contract was not taken, did not find its value at the time of taking, and failed to find facts from which such value appears. Determination of just compensation is to be based on the fact that claimant's contract and its rights and interest thereunder were expropriated, and that it is entitled to have their value at the time of the taking. The value of \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 126]\n\u00a0\n such ships at the time of requisition, and the then probable value at the time fixed for delivery, the contract price, the payments made and to be made, the time to elapse before completion and delivery, the possibility that by reason of the government's action in control of materials, etc., the contractor might not be able to complete the ship at the date fixed for performance, the loss of use of money to be sustained, the amount of other expenditures to be made between the time of requisition and delivery, together with other pertinent facts, are to be taken into account and given proper weight to determine the amount claimant lost by the taking ( The Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, 451 [33 Sup. Ct. 729]; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 76\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 667; Boston Chamber of Commerce v. Boston, \n217 \nU.S. 189, 195\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 459; Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, supra, 343 [13 Sup. Ct. 622]); that is, the sum which will put it in as good a position pecuniarily as it would have been in if its property had not been taken ( United States v. New River Collieries, supra, 343 [43 Sup. Ct. 565]; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United States, supra, 305 [43 Sup. Ct. 354]).\n Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the consideration of this case.\n\n Separate Opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n This case is of special importance because of the immense sums involved in similar pending claims. Ten ships-some larger than No. 193- were requisitioned at Camden alone. Speaking with constraint, the findings of the Court of Claims leave much to be desired for ready understanding; but enough appears, I think to support its final judgment.\n Through change of name, the Brooks-Scanlon Corporation became successor to Carpenter-O'Brien Company and \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 127]\n\u00a0\n party to the written contract of March 28, 1916, under which the New York Shipbuilding Corporation undertook to construct at its Camden Yard a steamship of about eighty-five hundred tons (freighter No. 193), according to designated plans, on or before February 1, 1918; $595,000, payable in installments, was the price first stated; prior to May 25, 1917, because of changes, this was increased to $811,130. The East Coast Transportation Company and the New York Shipbuilding Company were the original contracting parties. The Brooks-Scanlon Corporation acquired the former's interest; the New York Shipbuilding Corporation those of the latter.\n The Act of Congress approved June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, provides:\n'The President is hereby authorized and empowered, within the limits of the amounts herein authorized--\n\n'(a) To place an order with any person for such ships or material as the necessities of the government, to be determined by the President, may require during the period of the war and which are of the nature, kind and quantity usually produced or capable of being produced by such person.\n\n'(b) To modify, suspend, cancel, or requisition any existing or future contract for the building, production, or purchase of ships or material.\n\n'(c) To require the owner or occupier of any plant in which ships or materials are built or produced to place at the disposal of the United States the whole or any part of the output of such plant, to deliver such output or part thereof in such quantities and at such times as may be specified in the order.\n\n\n (d)\n To requisition and take over for use or operation by the United States any plant, or any part thereof without taking possession of the entire plant, whether the United States has or has not any contract or agreement with the owner or occupier of such plant.\n'(e) To purchase, requisition, or take over the title to, or the possession of, for use or operation by the United States any ship now constructed \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 128]\n\u00a0\n or in the process of construction or hereafter constructed, or any part thereof, or charter of such ship.\n\n'Compliance with all orders issued hereunder shall be obligatory on any person to whom such order is given, and such order shall take precedence over all other orders and contracts placed with such person. ...\n\n'Whenever the United States shall cancel, modify, suspend or requisition any contract, make use of, assume, occupy, requisition, acquire or take over any plant or part thereof, or any ship, charter, or material, in accordance with the provisions hereof, it shall make just compensation therefor, to be determined by the President; and if the amount thereof, so determined by the President, is unsatisfactory to the person entitled to receive the same, such person shall be paid seventy-five per centum of the amount so determined by the President and shall be entitled to sue the United States to recover such further sum as, added to said seventy-five per centum, will make up such amount as will be just compensation therefor, in the manner provided for by section twenty-four, paragraph twenty, and section one hundred and forty-five of the Judicial Code. ...\n\n'The cost of purchasing, requisitioning, or otherwise acquiring plants, material, charters, or ships now constructed or in the course of construction and the expediting of construction of ships thus under construction shall not exceed the sum of $250,000,000, exclusive of the cost of ships turned over to the Army and Navy. ...'\n\n July 11, 1917, the President delegated his powers granted by the statute, to the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation- the 'Fleet Corporation.' Purporting to act as thus authorized, and referring to ten vessels then under construction at the Camden Yard, the Fleet Corporation notified the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, August 3, 1917:\n'All power-driven cargo-carrying and passenger ships above \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 129]\n\u00a0\n 2,500 tons d. w. capacity, under construction in your yard, and certain materials, machinery, equipment, outfit, and commitments for materials, machinery, equipment, and outfit necessary for their completion are hereby requisitioned by the United States. On behalf of the United States, by virtue of said act and said order, you are hereby required to complete the construction of said requisitioned ships under construction and will prosecute such work with all practicable dispatch.

You will furnish immediately general plans and detail specifications of the ships requisitioned, and copies of contracts and all supplemental agreements in relation thereto, and full particulars as to owner, date of completion, payments made to date, amounts still due, and any other information necessary to a fair and just determination of the obligations of the Emergency Fleet Corporation in taking over these ships and contracts. You will report immediately whether any additional contracts are under consideration and their character and extent, and will not enter into any additional contracts or commitments with respect to merchant tonnage without express authority from this corporation.'\n\n August 18, 1917, the Fleet Corporation addressed a letter to the East Coast Transportation Company (predecessor of Brooks-Scanlon Corporation) giving notice of the requisition order of August 3d, and on August 28, 1917, served on the Carpenter-O'Brien Company a substantially identical letter, which stated:\n'On August 3, 1917, the United States Emergency Fleet Corporation issued to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation the notice or requisition set forth in inclosure 'a.'\n\n'In response to this communication the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, the shipbuilders, informed us \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 130]\n\u00a0\n that the East Coast Transportation Company, as owners, or representatives of owners, had entered into a contract with them for the following vessel:\n\n'Hull No. 193; type, cargo; d. w. tons, 8,100; date of contract, 3-28- 16 (assigned 5-24-17).\n\n'Under date of August 23d you advised that this contract had been assigned to you.\n\n'The corporation's district officer having charge of vessels in the district in which the shipbuilders are located has been instructed to take charge, for the corporation, of the completion of vessels now under construction, and has been authorized temporarily to take over your local inspecting officers at their present compensation. Will you please inform the district officer, Mr. G. R. McDermott, at room 302, 1319 F. Street N. W., Washington, D. C., the names of your representatives and their compensation, sending a duplicate to this office. Your co-operation with the corporation is invited.\n\n'The corporation will consider payments to the contractor accruing since the date of requisition, upon the receipt of proper vouchers and adequate information to be forwarded through its district officers.\n\n'You are requested, as soon as possible, to report to the corporation a statement in detail of the payments already made by you on each ship named above prior to the date of the requisitioning, August 3, 1917. This statement should be accompanied by the original vouchers and receipts and should be verified under oath by the proper corporate officer of your company.\n\n'It is the present intention of the corporation to reimburse you promptly, so far as funds are available, for the payments heretofore made to the shipbuilder if after investigation of data submitted by you such payments are found in order and in conformity with the contract requirements.\n\n'At your further and early convenience you are requested to submit to the corporation a statement of such \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 131]\n\u00a0\n indirect expenditures as you have made on account of each vessel; for instance, the cost of superintendence, original design, interest on funds already paid, and the like. The matters mentioned will require careful audit, and in addition you may submit any other matters you deem pertinent.\n\n'It will be perceived that the corporation presumes it is addressing this letter to the owners, or responsible representatives of the owners, or persons entitled to receive compensation on account of the requisition of the vessels listed above. The corporation requests that there be included in your response to this letter all evidence of ownership which is necessary to establish the right of those who are entitled to receive the compensation provided by law.\n\n'The consummation of the orders herein and heretofore transmitted will be made the subject of later appropriate corporate action.'\n\n August 22, 1917, the Fleet Corporation, through General Manager Capps, forwarded the following letter to Agent McDermott, and, as directed, the latter promptly delivered a copy thereof to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation with request that it govern itself accordingly.\n'Dear Sir: Referring to the vessels under construction in the yard of New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, N. J., requisitioned under the corporation's order of August 3d, precedent to the final examination of the contract for the vessels in question, you are requested to inform the shipbuilder as follows:\n\n'The ships now under construction at your plant and referred to above having been requisitioned by the duly authorized order of this corporation and title thereto taken over by the United States, and an order having been placed with you by due authority to complete the construction of said ships with all practicable dispatch, you \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 132]\n\u00a0\n are further ordered by the President of the United States, represented by this corporation, to proceed in the work of completion heretofore ordered, in conformity with the requirements of the contract, plans, and specifications under which construction proceeded prior to the requisition of August 3, 1917, in so far as the said contract describes the ship, the materials, machinery, equipment, outfit, workmanship, insurance, classification and survey thereof, including the meeting of the requirements of the said contract and all tests as to efficiency and capacity of the ship on completion, and in so far as the contract contains provisions for the benefit and protection of the person with whom the contract was made, but not otherwise.\n\n'All work will proceed under the inspection of such persons as have been or may hereafter, from time to time, be designated by this corporation for that purpose.\n\n'For the work of completion heretofore and herein ordered the corporation will pay to you amounts equal to payments set forth in the contract and not yet paid: Provided, that on acceptance in writing of this order you agree that on final acceptance of the vessel to give a bill of sale to the United States in satisfactory form, conveying all your right, title, and interest in the vessel, together with your certificate that the vessel is free from liens, claims or equities, with the exceptior of those of the owner, and then only to those set forth in the contract. Compensation to the shipbuilder for expedition and for extra work will, when deemed appropriate, be made the subject of a subsequent order.\n\n'This order applies only to vessels actually under construction and in accepting it the corporation expects you to inform it of the actual stage of construction of each vessel or the part to be assembled therein on the date of requisitioning, August 3, 1917. The corporation reserves the right to decide whether or not a vessel was actually under construction on August 3, 1917, on consideration of the ascertained facts. \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 133]\n\u00a0\n 'In replying to this communication, please arrange to specify separately the vessels to which this order refers, and refer to the corresponding contract in sufficient terms for identification of it.\n\n'Please furnish a copy of this to New York Shipbuilding Corporation and ask for an early reply.\n\n Very truly yours,\n'W. L. Capps, General Manager.'\n\n Replying, September 20, 1917, the Shipbuilding Corporation advised the Emergency Fleet Corporation:\n'Referring to the order dated August 22, 1917, made by United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, and delivered to this company, we beg to say:\n\n'We understand that by the Act of Congress of June 15, 1917, entitled 'An act making appropriations for the Military and Naval Establishments on account of war expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1917, and for other purposes,' and the executive order dated July 11, 1917, made by the President with respect to said act, and transmitted to us by the Emergency Fleet Corporation under date of August 3, 1917, we are under obligation to comply with the order of the Emergency Fleet Corporation dated August 3, 1917, requisitioning ships at this company's plant.\n\n'This corporation, therefore, accepts United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation's order dated August 22, 1917, for the completion of the vessels under contract in this yard on August 3, 1917, known as hull No. ___, and agrees that, upon the completion and acceptance of said vessels and upon complete payment [by] United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, together with such additional compensation as may be agreed upon, this company will execute and deliver to the United States of America a bill of sale conveying all this company's right, title, and interest in the vessels without prejudice to any claim of the person or corporation \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 134]\n\u00a0\n who originally contracted for the construction of said vessels, and those claiming rights under such original contractor, together with our certificate that the vessels are free from liens, claims or equities except such liens, claims, or equities as may be asserted by, or exist in favor of, the person or corporation who originally contracted for the construction of the vessels, and those claiming rights under such original contractor.'\n\n September 13, 1917, the Fleet Corporation telegraphed the Shipbuilding Corporation:\n'Do not accept further payments from former owners on account of requisitioned ships. This is mandatory.'\n\n December 8, 1917, the Shipbuilding Corporation and the Fleet Corporation agreed.\n'On and prior to August 3, 1917, the Shipbuilding Corporation was constructing under private contract with the corporations named below [ hereinafter called 'former owners'] ships bearing the hull numbers of the type and for the contract prices set opposite their respective names. ... [There were 10 of them.]\n\n'Due to war conditions, such contract prices have proved and will prove to be less than the actual cost of constructing such ships. On August 3, 1917, all of such ships, together with the materials assembled therefor, were requisitioned by the Fleet Corporation, acting in accordance with the provisions of the Urgent Deficiency Act of June 15, 1917, and the executive order of July 11, 1917. The Shipbuilding Corporation by such requisition was directed to complete such ships on behalf of the United States.\n\n'The parties hereto desire to fix the just compensation to be paid to the Shipbuilding Corporation in accordance with the provisions of such Urgent Deficiency Act, and to that end the Fleet Corporation is willing to increase such contract prices. ...\n\n'The Fleet Corporation hereby agrees to pay to the Shipbuilding Corporation as just compensation for the \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 135]\n\u00a0\n completion of said ten ships, hulls Nos. ... the entire cost of construction of said ships, figured from the commencement by the Shipbuilding Corporation of the construction of said ten ships up to the times of completion thereof respectively, and in addition thereto with respect to each ship ten dollars ($10) per dead-weight ton for profit. There shall be credited, however, in favor of the Fleet Corporation all sums heretofore received by the Shipbuilding Corporation on account of the construction of such ten ships respectively, either from the former owners or from the Fleet Corporation.'\n\n The amended petition, filed June 12, 1920-prior to our decision of Omnia Commercial Company v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 502, 513\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 437-and upon which the cause was tried, alleges:\n'That said builder, the New York Shipbuilding Company, had, up to the 3d day of August, 1917, duly contracted for all of the materials, equipment and supplies sufficient to complete said ship as specified in said contract, and that a large portion of such material, equipment and supplies had been duly prepared and delivered to the yard of said builder on said day, and that the remainder thereof, sufficient to complete said ship, had been duly contracted for by said builder and was, thereafter, delivered under the provisions of said contracts and entered into the construction and completion of said ship, and that said builder had performed and caused to be performed a large amount of labor under said contract upon, in and about the construction of said ship, and that said builder had duly paid for said contracts for material, equipment and supplies, the delivery thereof, and for the labor furnished and performed in and about such construction by moneys so paid to said builder by said owner as herein stated, and that said builder, on the 3d day of August, 1917, on its part, had fully complied with the terms of said contract, and was then and was always thereafter \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 136]\n\u00a0\n ready, able and willing to complete the same in all particulars. ...\n\n'That on June 15, 1917, by chapter 29, 40 Statutes at Large, 183, Congress authorized the President, among other things to modify, suspend and cancel or requisition any existing or future contract for the building, production or purchase of ships or materials, etc., and further to purchase, requisition or take over the title to or the possession of, for use or operation by the United States, any ship then constructed or in the process of construction, or thereafter constructed, or any part thereof, or the charter of said ship. In further accordance with said act of the President, by order dated July 11, 1917, deputed to the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation full power to act thereunder including the power to provide just compensation therefor, and the said corporation, by its order of August 3, 1917, on behalf of the United States, took over all the property of the claimant in or under said contract, including the said ship under construction and all materials, machinery, equipment, outfit and commitments therefor, and all labor performed thereon necessary for its completion, meaning thereby everything in existence and as expressed in said order 'required to complete the construction of said requisitioned ships under construction,' as will more fully appear by reference to the order of W. L. Capps, General Manager, which reads as follows. [Here follows copy of requisition notice to the Shipbuilding Corporation dated August 3d and inclosed in letter of August 28th addressed to Carpenter-O'Brien Company.] ...\n\n'That said requisition order was fully complied with and all of the property of said owner, the claimant herein, hereinbefore described, was taken by the said United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation for and on behalf of the United States, and was thereafter retained by and used for the purposes of the United States \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 137]\n\u00a0\n as provided by law, and that the said owner was thereby and thereafter deprived of all of its use and value. That said ship so taken was then under construction by said builder and thereafter was fully completed without change of plans or specifications from those set forth in the said construction contract as amended and supplemented, and that the said materials, equipment, outfit and supplies, and the said commitments and contracts for materials, equipment, outfit and supplies as described in said requisition order and paid for by the said owner and taken as aforesaid, were actually used in the construction and completion of said ship and were substantially sufficient to so construct, complete, equip and supply said ship as described in said plans and specifications as amended and supplemented. ...\n\n'That a fair and reasonable value of the said property so requisitioned and taken, and of which said owner was deprived on said 3d day of August, 1917, as aforesaid, was, at the rate of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) per ton for 8,597 dead weight tons, the sum of two millions one hundred forty-nine thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($2,149,250) less the sum of four hundred twelve thousand one hundred thirty dollars ($412,130) as aforesaid (required to be paid by said owner to said builder under the provisions of said construction contract as amended and supplemented, in order to fully complete, supply and equip said ship in accordance with the terms and conditions of said construction contracts hereinbefore set forth), so that the total amount due to said claimant on the said 3d day of August, 1917, on account of the transactions hereinbefore set forth was the sum of one million seven hundred thirty-seven thousand one hundred twenty dollars ($1,737,120).'\n\n The ship was finally completed and delivered September 20, 1918.\n Departing from the theory of the complaint, petitioner now maintains that its right and interest in the shipbuilding \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 138]\n\u00a0\n contract were expropriated by the United States for public use; that the contract itself was requisitioned, not frustrated; and that compensation must be made for the full value of the contract as of the date when so taken. The Court of Claims denied this demand, but held petitioner should receive the sum of partial payments which it made to the shipbuilder under the contract prior to the requisition order of August 3, 1917, with interest.\n I can find no sufficient basis for holding that the Fleet Corporation expropriated the claimant's contract or intended so to do, or consciously assumed liability for the value thereof. Claimant never had either title to or possession of the vessel. It was only a responsible party to an executory contract for construction, always subject to frustration by condemnation of the vessel.\n The order of August 3d, addressed only to the Shipbuilding Corporation, plainly recites that:\n'All power-driven cargo-carrying and passenger ships above 2,500 tons d. w. capacity, under construction in your yard, and certain materials, machinery, equipment, outfit, and commitments for materials, machinery, equipment, and outfit necessary for their completion are hereby requisitioned by the United States.'\n\n On that date the Shipbuilding Corporation had possession of the ship as well as title thereto. The United States then assumed control and the immediate result was to frustrate the building contract. Frustration by the exercise of the power of eminent domain was an implied condition. The United States became liable to the owner-the Shipbuilding Corporation-for the value of property actually taken. What that value was we need not inquire; the builder accepted the requisition-order and the agreement of December 8th, and does not now seek to recover more.\n Certainly, no notice concerning requisition went to the Brooks- Scanlon Corporation prior to the letters of August 18th and 28th, whereas the building contract had been frustrated by taking the ship on August 3d. \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 139]\n\u00a0\n The communication of August 22d to the Shipbuilding Corporation referred to the vessels in the yard as having been 'requisitioned under the corporation's order of August 3d, precedent to the final examination of the contract for the vessels in question,' and 'title thereto taken over by the United States,' directed their completion in conformity with contract, etc., which existed on that date, and stated that 'for the work of completion heretofore and herein ordered the corporation will pay to you amounts equal to payments set forth in the contract and not yet paid,' with a certain important proviso.\n On September 20th the Shipbuilding Corporation recognized that the ship had been requisitioned by the order of August 3d and promised to complete upon payment of compensation named in original contract and 'such additional compensation as may be agreed upon.'\n The telegram of September 13th referred to 'requisitioned ships.' The contract of December 8th recites that 'on August 3, 1917, all of such ships, together with the materials assembled therefor, were requisitioned by the Fleet Corporation.'\n The notices addressed to East Coast Transportation Company and Carpenter-O'Brien Company, August 18th and 28th, indicate that on August 3d the Fleet Corporation was unaware of the parties to or the terms of the building contract. These notices declared a purpose to 'consider payments to the contractor accruing since the date of requisition,' and an intention 'to reimburse you promptly, so far as funds are available, for the payments heretofore made to the shipbuilder,' and further:\n'It will be perceived that the corporation presumes it is addressing this letter to the owners, or responsible representatives of the owners, or persons entitled to receive compensation on account of the requisition of the vessels listed above.'\n\n The reported facts seem inconsistent with any definite purpose by the Fleet Corporation to requisition the contract, \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 140]\n\u00a0\n as distinguished from the vessel itself-certainly, there was no apparent reason for any such action. It expressed a purpose to reimburse for payments made under the building contract and to consider such sums when seeking to determine compensation for the shipbuilder. It also demanded that the builder should complete the vessel as provided by the contract. The builder acquiesced, and its rights are not now in controversy. The right of the claimant to reimbursement for the actual payments which it made under the contract prior to frustration is not challenged; it was properly considered in adjusting the sums to be paid to all parties. I can see no sufficient reason for awarding the value of a contract which perhaps might have been realized if the United States had not exercised their clear right to take over the partially completed vessel. No such claim was advanced by the petition; there was ample power in the Fleet Corporation to frustrate the building contract; and there seems no necessity for interpreting its action as accomplishing more. The Fleet Corporation evidently intended to requisition the vessel, and when claimant filed its petition in 1920 it does not seem to have thought the contract had been requisitioned. A few vague and general words used in the hurry of the times and without full information ought not to place an enormous, wholly unnecessary and unanticipated burden on the public treasury.\n The amended petition upon which the cause was tried proceeds upon the theory that claimant was owner of the vessel; that prior to August 3, 1917, the builder had duly contracted for all necessary material and supplies to complete the ship, performed much labor thereon, and had paid for all these things out of moneys received from the owner. It distinctly alleges:\n That the Fleet Corporation, 'by its order of August 3, 1917, on behalf of the United States, took over all the property of the claimant in or under said contract, including the said ship under construction \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 141]\n\u00a0\n and all materials, machinery, equipment, outfit and commitments therefor, and all labor performed thereon necessary for its completion, meaning thereby everything in existence and as expressed in said order 'required to complete the construction of said requisitioned ships under construction.' ... That said requisition order was fully complied with and all of the property of said owner, the claimant herein, hereinbefore described, was taken by the said United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation for and on behalf of the United States, and was thereafter retained by and used for the purposes of the United States as provided by law.'\n The court below-rightly, I think-declared:\n'The intent and purpose of the Shipping Board was, therefore, to requisition ships under construction, which was done in unmistakable language. It is admitted that the ships under construction, the materials, and so forth in the yard of the New York Shipbuilding Corporation were the property of that corporation, and the title to that property was in the Shipbuilding Corporation alone. Among the ships under construction so requisitioned was hull 193, which the Shipbuilding Corporation was building for the Carpenter-O'Brien Corporation, but it is not contended by the plaintiff that it had any title to or interest in said ship or the materials for its completion. All the interest it had was the right to the delivery of the ship when it should be completed. It follows that the United States did not take or requisition the ship or materials from the Carpenter- O'Brien Corporation nor did the United States take over or requisition the contract which the Carpenter-O'Brien Corporation had with the Shipbuilding Corporation.\n\n'It was made plain to the Carpenter-O'Brien Corporation that the United States did not intend to requisition the contract, for on August 28,1917, after notifying the \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 142]\n\u00a0\n Carpenter-O'Brien Corporation that it had taken over and requisitioned this ship from the Shipbuilding Corporation, the Shipping Board by letter of that date, stated what its intention was. A copy of said letter is set forth in full in finding VI. As further evidence showing the intention of the Shipping Board, reference is made to the letter of the board to G. R. McDermott, its officer, and which was communicated to the Shipbuilding Corporation. A copy of this letter is set forth in finding VIII. And as final evidence that the United States did not requisition the contract, and never intended to, the United States entered into a contract with the Shipbuilding Corporation for the completion of all ships under construction in its yard, included in which ships was hull 193, thereby making its own contract for the completion of this ship. This contract is set out in finding XVI. It is true that the plaintiff by reason of the requisitioning of the ship by the United States was deprived of the right to have delivered to it the ship when completed.\n\n'But there has been in this case no direct taking of the contract. The injury inflicted upon the plaintiff is a consequential injury resulting from the exercise of a lawful power in the requisitioning of the ship under construction. The requisitioning has worked indirectly harm and loss to the plaintiff, but not such harm and loss as can be held to obligate the government to pay for it. The action of the government may have destroyed the worth of the contract, but the law affords no remedy. The government by requisitioning the subject matter of the contract does not thereby take the contract. The subject matter in this case was the ship under construction, and that was what the government requisitioned, not the contract which was the agreement and obligation to perform. The performance of the contract in this case was frustrated and not appropriated. 'Frustration and appropriation are essentially different things.' Omnia Commercial Company v. United States,' supra. \n\n[265 U.S. 106, 143]\n\u00a0\n The principles involved have been so recently discussed in Omnia Commercial Company v. United States, that it seems unnecessary to restate them. We there said:\n\n'In the present case the effect of the requisition was to bring the contract to an end, not to keep it alive for the use of the government. The government took over during the war railroads, steel mills, ship yards, telephone and telegraph lines, the capacity output of factories and other producing activities. If appellant's contention is sound the government thereby took and became liable to pay for an appalling number of existing contracts for future service or delivery, the performance of which its action made impossible. This is inadmissible. Frustration and appropriation are essentially different things.'\n\n The evidence fails to show any definite purpose by the Fleet Corporation to requisition the contract. Up to the time of instituting suit the claimant evidently was unaware of any such requisition. And it seems to me clear enough that the court below rightly concluded that the demand now advanced is without merit.\n Mr. Justice SANFORD concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The President is hereby authorized and empowered ...\n'(a) To place an order with any person for such ships or material as the necessities of the government, to be determined by the President, may require during the period of the war and which are of the nature, kind and quantity usually produced or capable of being produced by such person.\n\n'(b) To modify, suspend, cancel, or requisition any existing or future contract for the building, production, or purchase of ships or material.\n\n'(c) To require the owner or occupier of any plant in which ships or materials are built or produced to place at the disposal of the United States the whole or any part of the output of such plant, to deliver such output or part thereof in such quantities and at such times as may be specified in the order.\n\n'(d) To requisition and take over for use or operation by the United States any plant, or any part thereof without taking possession of the entire plant, whether the United States has or has not any contract or agreement with the owner or occupier of such plant.\n\n'(e) To purchase, requisition, or take over the title to, or the possession of, for use or operation by the United States any ship now constructed or in the process of construction or hereafter constructed, or any part thereof, or charter of such ship.\n\n'Compliance with all orders issued hereunder shall be obligatory on any person to whom such order is given, and such order shall take precedence over all other orders and contracts placed with such person . ...\n\n'Whenever the United States shall cancel, modify, suspend or requisition any contract, ... it shall make just compensation therefor, to be determined by the President; and if the amount thereof, so determined by the President, is unsatisfactory to the person entitled to receive the same, such person shall be paid seventy-five per centum of the amount so determined by the President and shall be entitled to sue the United States to recover such further sum as, added to said seventy-five per centum, will make up such amount as will be just compensation therefor, in the manner provided for \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Claimant paid out:\n Architect's fees $ 5,500 00 Cash to builder 239,500 00 Notes to builder 180,000 00 Interest on notes 28,433 33 ___ Total $453,433 33 Value of plans and specifictions 20,277 25 ___ $473,710 58 Less 75 per cent. of award 332,012 87 ___ Balanace $141,697 71\n Interest was computed and allowed as follows:\n On $473,710.58 minus $28,433.33, or $445,277.25, from August 3, 1917 ( date of requisition), to February 24, 1920 (date of payment of 75 per cent. of award), $68,350.06.\n On $445,277.25 minus $332,012.87, or $113,264.38, from February 24, 1920 to April 23, 1923 (date of judgment), $21,501.35.\n Total of interest $ 89,851 41 Added to 141,697 71 ___ Produces amount of judgment $231,549 12\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The figure contended for is $425,000, made up of $419,506, paid by claimant to builder, and $5,500, architect's fee.

Campbell, of Cincinnati, Ohio, pro se.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by John V. Campbell to recover compensation for 1.81 acres of land taken by the United States to be part of a site for a plant for the production of nitrates. The district court found that the value of the land was $750, and that, by the taking, the remainder of his property was damaged $2,250. It also found that, by reason of the uses to be made of lands acquired from others for the same project, plaintiff's lands not taken were damaged $5,000. The court allowed the first two items and disallowed the last. The judgment was for $3,000 and interest. Plaintiff took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals on writ of error, but it should have been brought to this court (section 24, par. 20, Judicial Code [Comp. St.  991]; J. Homer Fritch, Inc., v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 458\n, 39 S. Ct. 158), and it was transferred under section 238a, Judicial Code (Act Sept. 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837 [ Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1215a]). 291 F. 1015. The question for decision is whether plaintiff was entitled to \n\n[266 U.S. 368, 370]\n\u00a0\n the damages to the remainder of his estate resulting from the use to be made of the lands acquired from others.\n In 1918 the United States, to aid in the prosecution of the war, had determined to build a nitrate plant at Ancor in the Little Miami valley, near Cincinnati, Ohio. In order to get a site, it had taken possession of many parcels of land making up a large tract, adjoining plaintiff's estate of 69.73 acres. August 31, 1918, an officer of the army, acting under the direction of the Secretary of War, and without obtaining plaintiff's consent or instituting condemnation proceedings or making any compensation therefor, took possession of a part of plaintiff's land, which was separated from the remainder by a public road. It was a garden, lying at the foot of a hill on which plaintiff's residence was situated. The entire tract, including the land taken from plaintiff, comprised 1,300 acres. The United States constructed on the site buildings, roads, railroads, a sewerage system, and such other things as are usually incidental to a large industrial plant. After the armistice, the project was abandoned. Some of the lands constituting the site were returned to the former owners, and some were sold. And the United States has determined to sell the rest of the land which includes that taken from plaintiff and amounts in all to 320 acres. The court found that the damages to the remainder of plaintiff's estate from the use to be made of lands acquired from others resulted chiefly from the probability that the tract, improved as it has been by the United States will be sold and used for industrial purposes.\n The taking was under the sovereign power of eminent domain. The President and Secretary of War were authorized to purchase or condemn the lands. Act June 3, 1916, c. 134,  124, 39 Stat. 215 (Comp. St.  3110b); Act July 2, 1917, c. 35, 40 Stat. 241, as amended April 11, 1918, c. 51, 40 Stat. 518 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6911a). And from the taking there arose an implied \n\n[266 U.S. 368, 371]\n\u00a0\n promise by the United States to compensate plaintiff for his loss. United States v. Great Falls Mfg. Co., \n112 \nU.S. 645, 656\n, 5 S. Ct. 306; United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 464\n, 23 S. Ct. 349; United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 329\n, 37 S. Ct. 380; United States v. North American Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330, 333\n, 40 S. Ct. 518. Thereupon he became entitled to have the just compensation safeguarded by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution; that is, the value of the land taken and the damages inflicted by the taking- such a sum as would put him in as good a position pecuniarily as he would have been if his property had not been taken. Seaboard Air Line Railway Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 304\n, 43 S. Ct. 354. But he was not entitled to have more than that.\n The land taken from plaintiff was not shown to be indispensable to the construction of the nitrate plant or to the proposed use of the other lands acquired by the United States. The damages resulting to the remainder from the taking of a part were separable from those caused by the use to be made of the lands acquired from others. The proposed use of the lands taken from others did not constitute a taking of his property. Richards v. Washington Terminal Co., \n233 \nU.S. 546, 554\n, 34 S. Ct. 654, L. R. A. 1915A, 887. Plaintiff had no right to prevent the taking and use of the lands of others; and the exertion by the United States of the power of eminent domain did not deprive him of any right in respect of such lands. And, if the land taken from plaintiff had belonged to another, or if it had not been deemed part and parcel of his estate, he would not have been entitled to anything on account of the diminution in value of his estate. It is only becuase of the taking of a part of his land that he became entitled to any damages resulting to the rest. In the absence of a taking, the provision of the Fifth Amendment giving just compensation does not apply; and there is no statute applicable in this case that enlarges the constitutional right. If the former private owners had devoted their \n\n[266 U.S. 368, 372]\n\u00a0\n lands to the identical uses for which they were acquired by the United States or to which they probably will be put, as found by the court, they would not have become liable for the resulting diminution in value of plaintiff's property. The liability of the United States is not greater than would be that of the private users. Plaintiff cites and relies upon Blesch v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co., 43 Wis. 183, C., K. & N. Ry. Co. v. Van Cleave, 52 Kan. 665, 33 P. 472, and Haggard v. Independent School District, 113 Iowa, 486, 85 N. W. 777, to support his contention that he is entitled to have the damages found to have resulted to the remainder of his estate by the uses made and to be made of the lands acquired from others. In each of these cases, it was impossible separately to ascertain the damages caused to the remainder of the owner's tract by the taking and proposed use of a part of it. In this case, such damages were separately found, and plaintiff does not complain in respect of the amount of that element. We think that plaintiff's contention is not sustained. The rule supported by better reason and the weight of authority is that the just compensation assured by the Fifth Amendment to an owner, a part of whose land is taken for public use, does not include the diminution in value of the remainder caused by the acquisition and use of adjoining lands of others for the same undertaking.

SINCLAIR(1924)\nNo. 467\nArgued: Decided: April 21, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 543, 544]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. Gwynn Gardiner, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n Messrs. Chapin Brown and R. H. McNeill, both of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 543, 546]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought to restrain the enforcement of an order of the Rent Commission of the District of Columbia cutting down the rents for apartments in the Chastleton apartment house in this city. The defendants are the Rent Commission and the tenants of the building. The order was passed on August 7, 1922, and purports to fix the reasonable rates from the preceding first of March. The bill seems to have been filed on October 27, 1922, and seeks relief on several grounds. The first and most important is that the emergency that justified interference with ordinarily existing private rights in 1919 had come to an end in 1922, and no longer could be applied consistently with the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Subordinate ones are that the plaintiff Hahn bought the premises on September 25, 1922, it would seem under foreclosure of a preexisting mortgage or deed of trust, and that he and his grantee, the Chastleton Corporation, were strangers to the proceeding before the Commission and not bound by it, but that the tenants not only were relying upon it but were making it a ground for demanding repayment from the Corporation of rents paid in excess of the sums fixed by the Commission after March 1, 1922, although the Corporation did not receive them. On motion the bill was dismissed by the courts below, the Court of Appeals, in view of Block v. Hirsh, \n256 U.S. 135\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 458, 16 A. L. R. 165, leaving it for this Court to say whether conditions had so far changed as to affect the constitutional applicability of the law. The allegations do not make the position of the \n\n[264 U.S. 543, 547]\n\u00a0\n Chastleton Corporation and Hahn sufficiently clear and therefore we feel bound to consider the constitutional question that the bill seeks to raise.\n It is objected that the plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law by way of appeal. But apart from the fact that it is doubtful whether the Chastleton Corporation and Hahn were not entitled to treat the order as a nullity so far as they were concerned, it is open to equal doubt whether in a proceeding under the law they could assail its validity. There are many tenants to be dealt with. However looked at a bill in equity is the natural and best way of settling the parties' rights. See, e. g., Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, \n256 U.S. 170\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 465.\n The original Act of October 22, 1919, c. 80, tit. 2, 41 Stat. 297, considered in Block v. Hirsh, was limited to expire in two years. Section 122. The Act of August 24, 1921, c. 91, 42 Stat. 200, purported to continue it in force, with some amendments, until May 22, 1922. On that day a new act declared that the emergency described in the original title 2 still existed, reenacted with further amendments the amended Act of 1919, and provided that it was continued until May 22, 1924. Act of May 22, 1922, c. 197, 42 Stat. 543.\n We repeat what was stated in Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135, 154\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 458, 16 A. L. R. 165, as to the respect due to a declaration of this kind by the Legislature so far as it relates to present facts. But even as to them a Court is not at liberty to shut its eyes to an obvious mistake, when the validity of the law depends upon the truth of what is declared. \n256 U.S. 154\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 458, 16 A. L. R. 165. Chas. Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 536\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280. And still more obviously so far as this declaration looks to the future it can be no more than prophecy and is liable to be controlled by events. A law depending upon the existence of an emergency or other certain state of facts to uphold it may cease to operate if the emergency ceases or the facts change even though \n\n[264 U.S. 543, 548]\n\u00a0\n valid when passed.

Consolidated Gas Co., \n258 U.S. 165\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 264, a statutory rate that had been sustained for earlier years in Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 U.S. 19\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 192, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134, was held confiscatory for 1918 and 1919\n\n\n The order, although retrospective, was passed some time after the latest statute, and long after the original act would have expired. In our opinion it is open to inquire whether the exigency still existed upon which the continued operation of the law depended. It is a matter of public knowledge that the Government has considerably diminished its demand for employees, that was one of the great causes of the sudden afflux of people to Washington, and that other causes have lost at least much of their power. It is conceivable that, as is shown in an affidavit attached to the bill, extensive activity in building has added to the ease of finding an abode. If about all that remains of war conditions is the increased cost of living that is not in itself a justification of the Act. Without going beyond the limits of judicial knowledge, we can say at least that the plaintiffs' allegations cannot be declared offhand to be unmaintainable, and that it is not impossible that a full development of the facts will show them to be true. In that case the operation of the statute would be at an end.\n We need not inquire how far this Court might go in deciding the question for itself, on the principles explained in Prentis v. Attlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 227\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 67. See Gardner v. Barney, 6 Wall. 499; South Ottawa v. Perkins, \n94 U.S. 260\n, Jones v. United States, \n137 U.S. 202\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 80; Travis v. Yale & Towne Manufacturing Co., \n252 \nU.S. 60, 80\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 228. These cases show that the Court may ascertain as it sees fit any fact that is merely a ground for laying down a rule of law, and if the question \n\n[264 U.S. 543, 549]\n\u00a0\n were only whether the statute is in force to-day, upon the facts that we judicially know we should be compelled to say that the law has ceased to operate. Here however it is material to know the condition of Washington at different dates in the past. Obviously the facts should be accurately ascertained and carefully weighed, and this can be done more conveniently in the Supreme Court of the District than here. The evidence should be preserved so that if necessary it can be considered by this Court.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (concurring in part).\n So far as concerns the Chastleton Corporation and Hahn, I agree that the decree should be reversed. So far as concerns the plaintiff Lake, the bill was properly dismissed for want of equity; among other reasons, because his administrative appeal from the order of the Rent Commission was pending in the Supreme Court of the District when this suit was begun, and still remains undisposed of. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 U.S. 210\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 67.\n If protection of the rights of The Chastleton Corporation and Hahn required us to pass upon the constitutionality of the District Rent Acts, I should agree, also, to the procedure directing the lower court to ascertain the facts. But, in my opinion, it does not. For (on facts hereinafter stated which appear by the bill and which were, also, admitted at the bar) the order entered by the Commission is void as to them, even if the Rent Acts are valid. To express an opinion upon the constitutionality of the acts, or to sanction the inquiry directed, would, therefore, be contrary to a long-prevailing practice of the Court. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[264 U.S. 543, 550]\n\u00a0\n The District Rent Act of 1921 (which was in force when the proceeding before the Commission was begun, and thereafter until May 22, 1922) provides that in all 'cases the commission shall give notice personally or by registered mail and afford an opportunity to be heard to all parties in interest.' Act of October 22, 1919, c. 80, title 2,  106, 41 Stat. 297, 300. The District Rent Act of 1922 (which was in force when the order of the Commission was entered) amended this clause concerning notice by adding thereto the words:\n'Provided, That notice given by the commission to an agent for the collection of rents due his principal shall be deemed and held to be good and sufficient notice to the principal.' Act of May 22, 1922, c. 197,  7, 42 Stat. 543, 546.\n\n The proceeding in which the order of the Rent Commission issued was begun January 25, 1922. Its order was entered August 7, 1922. When the proceeding before the Commission was begun, the plaintiff Lake was the owner of the property subject to mortgages theretofore executed \n\n[264 U.S. 543, 551]\n\u00a0\n and duly recorded. After the order was entered (and while that proceeding was pending on appeal in the Supreme Court of the District) the plaintiff Hahn purchased the property under the foreclosure of one of these mortgages. Thereafter, and before the institution of this suit, Hahn conveyed the property to his coplaintiff, the Chastleton Corporation. Hahn and the corporation do not claim title under Lake. They claim title as purchasers under the foreclosure of a mortgage which antedated Lake's purchase. Notice of the proceedings before the Commission was never served on the holder of the mortgage; and, of course, not on Hahn or on the Chastleton Corporation. The only notice ever served on any one was that given, on January 25, 1922, 'to the F. H. Smith Co., Agent.' That company was then the rental agent of the property for Lake. It had no authority to represent in any way either the mortgagee or those claiming under him.\n As the required notice was not served on the mortgagee, nor on those claiming under him, and as F. H. Smith Company was not the agent of any of them, the order is necessarily void as to the Chastleton Corporation and Hahn. The doctrine of lis pendens has no application to persons so situated.

C., for appellant Chicago Great Western Ry. Co.\n Messrs. J. G. Gamble, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Thos. P. Littlepage, of Washington, D. C., for appellant Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co.\n Mr. Ben J. Gibson, of Des Moines, Iowa, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two bills in equity, one by the Chicago Great Western Railway Company, a corporation of Illinois, and the other by the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company, a corporation of Illinois and Iowa, were brought against the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Auditor, and the Treasurer of Iowa, and another, constituting the Executive Council of the state, to enjoin the assessments for taxation of the railway properties of the complainants in Iowa as fixed by the Council. The injunction was sought on the ground that although under the laws and Constitution of Iowa, all property, real and personal, including railways must be assessed at its actual value, there was an intentional discrimination by the Executive Council against complainants, in that farm lands in the state were assessed at slightly over 38 \n\n[266 U.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n per cent. of their actual value, while the railway of the Great Western Railway Company in the state was intentionally assessed at 111.5 per cent. of its actual value, and that of the Rock Island at 75 per cent. There were averments that the amounts involved in the cases were more than $3, 000 in each. It was charged that such action was a denial to the railroad companies of the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The complainants asserted their right to relief in equity by injunction, because if the Executive Council certified their assessments and distributed them to all the counties through which the railways ran, it would entail on the companies a multiplicity of suits to vindicate their constitutional rights. Complainants moved for temporary injunctions under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243). The court, consisting of a circuit judge and two district judges, on the evidence adduced found that it did not disclose intentional discrimination by the state taxing tribunals, and denied the motions. Appeal was taken in both cases to this court under section 266, and a continuance of the restraining orders originally granted on the filing of the bill was asked pending a hearing of the appeal. This was resisted, but was finally allowed to the extent of enjoining upon a proper bond the Executive Council from certifying for collection, to the taxing officials of the counties through which the railways ran, assessments more than 92 per cent. in value of the assessments the subject of complaint. When these causes were called for hearing in this court, application was made for a continuance, on the plea that since November, 1922, when this appeal was allowed, the issue on the complete pleadings in the District Court had been referred to a master who had found that there was intentional discrimination, and an early final hearing on the merits was probable. It was suggested that this court would save time by awaiting the coming of a second \n\n[266 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n appeal on the merits. The counsel for the state resisted continuance and insisted that the state was embarrassed by withholding taxes due it and that it should not be delayed longer. Considering the fact that the railroad companies had succeeded in stopping the state from collecting part of the taxes for now more than two years in the face of a full preliminary hearing and adverse ruling by three judges, and nothing the evident purpose of Congress in the enactment of section 266 to prevent undue delay in enforcing state legislation and action through federal judicial intervention, this court has denied this request for a continuance and has heard the case.\n In the cases before us, we are relieved from considering and deciding the alleged infringement of the federal Constitution because in view of the basis for jurisdiction of the District Court, the cases can be disposed of as a question of state law.\n Jurisdiction of the bill in the Great Western Case exists because of the diverse citizenship of the parties. The District Court therefore has jurisdiction to enforce the rights of the complainant under the state Constitution and laws and prevent their violation.\n Jurisdiction of the bill in the Rock Island Case depends on the averment that the attempted assessment of complainant's railroad property in Iowa complained of was at a rate and upon a basis greater than the assessment of other property of the same class subjected to taxation in Iowa, and that the suit arises under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution forbidding any state to deprive any person of his property without due process of law or to deny him the equal protection of the laws. We think this averment in view of the allegations of the bill invoked a substantial controversy under the federal Constitution and gave the District Court jurisdiction. Its jurisdiction thus established gave the District Court the authority to determine all questions involved, \n\n[266 U.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n including questions of state law, irrespective of the disposition of the federal question, and as the relied to which the complainant might be entitled would be the same as that which should be allowed him by the federal court upon a construction of the state Constitution and laws such as he contends for, the question whether the acts complained of violated the federal Constitution need not be decided. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 37 S. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88; Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 586\n, 34 S. Ct. 372; Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175, 191\n, 29 S. Ct. 451. It follows, therefore, that in both the cases under consideration, the District Court has jurisdiction to consider and decide whether the complainants in these cases are so injured by a violation of the state Constitution and laws in the taxation of their property as to entitle them to the equitable remedy of injunction against the taxing officials made defendants. The averments of both bills make a case of unjust discrimination against complainants' property in that there is an intentional systematic undervaluation by state officials of Iowa of other taxable property of the same class, when the complainant's property is assessed and taxed at a much higher rate. In such cases, the federal authorities render it clear that the complainants may have the remedy by injunction in equity to prevent the taxation of their property at any higher rate than that imposed upon the property of those in whose favor the discrimination exists. Cummings v. National Bank, \n101 U.S. 153\n, 160; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. Company, \n244 \nU.S. 499, 516\n, 37 S. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88; Taylor v. Louisville & Nashville R. R.

Wakefield Tp., \n247 \nU.S. 350, 352\n, 38 S. Ct. 495. It is not enough, in these cases, that the taxing officials have merely made a mistake. It is not enough that the court, if its judgment were properly invoked, would reach a different conclusion as to the taxes \n\n[266 U.S. 94, 99]\n\u00a0\n imposed. There must be clear and affirmative showing that the difference is an intentional discrimination and one adopted as a practice.\n In Iowa the value of farm lands is assessed by local assessors, who fix the value of the properties under section 1305 of the Code Supplement of 1913, in the various taxing districts. Their assessments are submitted to the local board of review of the taxing district, and that board hears the complaints on the part of the property owner or the part of the public, and makes its findings. This action is submitted to the county board of supervisors, which as a board of equalization adjusts and equalizes the findings between the taxing districts of the county. The results of action by the county supervisors are sent to the State Auditor, and by him are laid before the Executive Council sitting as a state board of equalization, which equalizes them so that there may be as nearly as possible uniformity as between the counties. By section 1350 of the Code, real estate is listed and valued each odd numbered year. Railway properties are valued for assessment in a different way from real estate under the provisions of section 1336 of the Code of 1897. They are made upon the taxable value of the entire railway within the state and are made every year, and are distributed proportionately to the counties. In case a railway lies partly in the state and partly without it, the estimate of the value of its entire rolling stock and movable property is made after taking into consideration the proportion which the business of that part of the railway lying within the state bears to the business of the railway without the state. By section 1334 of the Code Supplement of 1913, a railway is obliged to submit to the Council for its information many details concerning its property, tangible and intangible, upon which to base an estimate of the value of the total property. These include the par and market values of the stocks and bonds, its net income and many other circumstances. \n\n[266 U.S. 94, 100]\n\u00a0\n Thus, the Executive Council assesses the value of railways in the state directly. It acts only as an equalizing tribunal, however, upon assessments on farm lands as between counties. This distinction does not prevent equitable relief. Even if the taxing tribunals were different boards and if the complaining taxpayers were intentionally discriminated against by the united action of two parts of the taxing machinery of the state, relief could be granted as shown in the authorities above cited.\n It was agreed between the parties that the average value for assessing farm lands was 61 per cent. The railway companies contended that the rate as fixed by the Council was very much higher than this for them. The three judges in the District Court found that the Executive Council might reasonably and without arbitrary or intentional discrimination reach the conclusion that the properties of the two companies in Iowa, tangible and intangible, were not assessed by the Executive Council in proportion to their actual value substantially more than the 61 per cent. imposed on farm lands. The court pointed out that railroad values were very difficult to fix and there was a wide range within which reasonable men might differ, and after an examination of the evidence, concluded they could not find that there was any arbitrary and unconscionable difference between the values assessed upon the two kinds of property. One circumstance to which the judges below gave weight was the value ascribed to the properties of these two railway companies in Iowa by their own admissions in what is known as Ex parte 74, an investigation by the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Transportation Act of 1920 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923 ,  10071 1\/4 et seq.).\n It would take a very clear case upon the record to justify this court in setting aside the conclusion of a court of three judges under section 266 upon what is solely a \n\n[266 U.S. 94, 101]\n\u00a0\n question of fact and an exercise of sound judicial discretion as to the just balance of convenience in granting or withholding a temporary suspension of the operation of a state law in the collection of taxes. This court must respect in the fullest degree the sensitiveness of Congress in hedging about the sovereign power of taxation by the states and precluding temporary federal judicial interference with it save in clear cases.

Luther M. Walter and John S. Burchmore, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Messrs. Blackburn Esterline and Robert J. Cary, both of Chicago, Ill., for the United States.\n Mr. P. J. Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Ralph M. Shaw, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees Chicago Junction Ry. Co. and others.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Chicago Junction Railway and the Chicago River & Indiana Railroad are terminal railroads located \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 260]\n\u00a0\n within the Chicago switching district. Prior to May 16, 1922, they were operated as independent belt lines, uncontrolled by any trunk line carrier, and they were used by the 23 railroads entering Chicago, impartially and without discrimination. Among these were the New York Central Lines and their chief competitors, the 6 carriers who are plaintiffs in this suit. \n1\n The New York Central sought to obtain control of these terminal railroads. To this end, it made an application to the Interstate Commerce Commission, on December 28, 1920, under paragraph 18 of section 1 and paragraph 12 of section 5 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended by Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 477, 481.2 The authorization requested was to make an agreement with stockholders then owning these properties by which, among other things, the New York Central would purchase all the capital stock of the Chicago River & Indiana Railroad for $750,000, and the latter company would lease for 99 years (and thereafter) the Chicago Junction Railway at an annual rental of $2,000,000. Upon this application hearings were had. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and its coplaintiffs herein, intervened, and opposed granting the application. On May 16, 1922, an order was entered which authorized the New York Central to acquire the Chicago River & Indiana Railroad stock, \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 261]\n\u00a0\n and authorized the latter company to lease the Chicago Junction Railway. \n3\n Chicago Junction Case, 71 Interst. Com. Comn. R. 631. The order did not fix the date when it should become effective. \n4\n Immediately after its entry, the purchase of the stock was completed and the lease was executed.\n On April 10, 1923, this suit was brought in the federal court for the Eastern district of Illinois against the United States, the Commission, the New York Central, the terminal railroads, and the stockholders thereof. 5 The relief sought is to have the order declared void, to have \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 262]\n\u00a0\n set aside the sale of the stock and the lease, to restore the status quo ante the order, and for an injunction. The case was heard before three judges on plaintiffs' motion for an interlocutory injunction and on defendants' motions to dismiss the bill. \n6\n The District Court, without opinion, denied the injunction and dismissed the bill. The case is here on direct appeal under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 ( Comp. St.  998).\n The order did not provide for the issue of a certificate of public convenience and necessity. It did not disclose whether it was issued under paragraph 18 of section 1 or under paragraph 2 of section 5. An application, by the carriers who are plaintiffs herein, that this be specified was denied by the Commission without opinion. In this court counsel for all the defendants stated that the order was entered solely under paragraph 2 of section 5. We have, therefore, no occasion to consider the incidents of applications under paragraph 18 of section 1, or rights thereunder. Several reasons are urged why the order should be held void. The defendants, besides asserting its validity, insist that the plaintiffs have no interest which entitles them to assail the order, and that there are, also, other obstacles to the maintenance of this suit.\n First. Plaintiffs contend that the order is void because there was no evidence to support the finding that the acquisition of control of the terminal railroads by the New York Central 'will be in the public interest.' The bill charges, in clear and definite terms, that this finding was wholly unsupported by evidence. We must take that fact as admitted for the purposes of this appeal. The allegation \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 263]\n\u00a0\n is made as one of fact. There is no suggestion in the motions to dismiss ( which are both general and special) that this fact is not well pleaded, or that a copy of the evidence introduced at the hearing should have been annexed to the bill. Compare Louisiana & Pine Bluff Ry. Co. v. United States, \n257 U.S. 114\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 25. Facts conceivably known to the Commission, but not put in evidence, will not support an order. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 185. The defendants concede that the New York Central could not legally acquire control of these terminal railroads unless authorized so to do by the Commission, pursuant to paragraph 2 of section 5, and that the Commission cannot legally grant such authority unless it finds, after hearing, that the acquisition 'will be in the public interest.' They contend that this order is not one of those subject to judicial review, and that, if subject to review, it cannot be held void merely because unsupported by evidence. These objections are based on the nature of the order, not on the class of persons by whom the judicial review is invoked.\n Whether this order can be described properly as legislative may be doubted. It is clear that legislative character alone would not preclude judicial review. Rate orders are clearly legislative. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 \nU.S. 210, 226\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 67. Nor would the further fact that the order is permissive preclude review, if by that term is meant an order which, in contradistinction to one compelling performance, authorizes a carrier to do some act otherwise prohibited. Orders entered under the Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  8, 36 Stat. 539, 547 (Comp. St.  8566), amending section 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act, are of this character. That section prohibits carriers from charging more 'for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line or route in the same direction' without obtaining authority from the Commission. A suit will lie to set aside an order granting such authority, and to enjoin action by the carried thereunder. \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 264]\n\u00a0\n Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 375. Compare United States v. Merchants' & Manufacturers' Traffic Association, \n242 U.S. 178\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 24. The order here challenged is wholly unlike those which have been held not subject to judicial review. In United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 82, 89\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 584, the action of the Commission, with which the court refused to interfere, was the assignment of a complaint for hearing. As this court said: 'The notice ... had no characteristic of an order, affirmative or negative.' In Proctor & Gamble v. United States, \n225 U.S. 282\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 761, Hooker v. Knapp, \n225 U.S. 302\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 769, and Lehigh Valley R. R. Co. v. United States, \n243 U.S. 412\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 397, judicial review was refused, not because the order was permissive, or because it was negative in character, but because it was a denial of the affirmative relief sought. \n7\n This court declined to interfere, because to do so would have involved exercise by it of the administrative function of granting the relief which the Commission, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, had denied. Here the order complained of is an affirmative one; that is, it grants the relief sought. Compare Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 483\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 383.\n It is further contended that paragraph 2 of section 5 confers a power purely discretionary, and that, for this reason, the order entered cannot be set aside by a court merely on the ground that the action taken was based on facts erroneously assumed, or of which there was no evidence. \n8\n The power here challenged is not of that character. Congress \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 265]\n\u00a0\n by using the phrase 'whenever the Commission is of opinion, after hearing,' prescribed quasi judicial action. \n9\n Upon application of a carrier, the Commission must form a judgment whether the acquisition proposed will be in the public interest. It may form this judgment only after hearing. \n10\n The provision for a hearing implies both the privilege of introducing evidence and the duty of deciding in accordance with it. To refuse to consider evidence introduced or to make an essential finding without supporting evidence is arbitrary action. As it was admitted by the motion that the order was unsupported by evidence, and since such an order is void, there is no occasion \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 266]\n\u00a0\n to consider the other grounds of invalidity asserted by plaintiffs.\n Second. The defendants contend that the plaintiffs have not the legal interest necessary to entitle them to challenge the order. That they have in fact a vital interest is admitted. they are the competitors of the New York Central. Practically all the tonnage originated at or destined to points on these terminal railroads is competitive, in that the same can be hauled either over the lines of the New York Central or over those of the plaintiffs. Prior to the date of the order, and while the terminal railroads were uncontrolled by any trunk line carrier, they were all served impartially and without discrimination, and they competed for the traffic on equal terms. The order substitutes for neutral control of the terminal railroads, monopoly of control in the New York Central, and, in so doing, necessarily gives to it substantial advantage over all its competitors and subjects the latter to serious disadvantage and prejudice. The main purpose of the acquisition by the New York Central was to secure a larger share of the Chicago business. By means of the preferential position incident to the control of these terminal railroads, it planned to obtain traffic theretofore enjoyed by its competitors. Because such was the purpose of the New York Central control, and would necessarily be its effect, these plaintiffs intervened before the Commission. That their apprehensions were well founded is shown by the results. The plaintiffs are no longer permitted to compete with the New York Central on equal terms. A large volume of traffic has been diverted from their lines to those of the New York Central. The diversion of traffic has already subjected the plaintiffs to irreparable injury. The loss sustained exceeds $ 10,000,000. Continued control by the New York Central will subject them to an annual loss in net earnings of approximately that amount. If, as suggested in Interstate Commerce Commission v. \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 267]\n\u00a0\n Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., \n218 \nU.S. 88, 109\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 651, a legal interest exists where carriers' revenues may be affected, there is clearly such an interest here.\n This loss is not the incident of more effective competition. Compare Edward Hines Trustees v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 143, 148\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 72, 68 L. Ed. --. It is injury inflicted by denying to the plaintiffs equality of treatment. To such treatment carriers are, under the Interstate Commerce Act, as fully entitled as any shipper. Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 U.S. 351\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 370. It is true that, before Transportation Act 1920, the Interstate Commerce Act would not have prohibited the owners of the terminal railroads from selling them to the New York Central. Nor would it have prohibited the latter company from making the purchase. And by reason of a provision then contained in section 3 of the Interstate Commerce Act the purchase might have enabled the New York Central to exclude all other carriers from use of the terminals. Compare Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. United States, \n242 U.S. 60\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 61; Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 482\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 383. But Transportation Act 1920 repealed that provision in section 3, it made provision for securing joint use of terminals, and it prohibited any acquisition of a railroad by a carrier, unless authorized by the Commission. By reason of this legislation, the plaintiffs, being competitors of the New York Central and users of the terminal railroads theretofore neutral, have a special interest in the proposal to transfer the control to that company.\n The plaintiffs may challenge the order because they are parties to it. Judicial Code,  212 (originally Commerce Court Act June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 543 [Comp. St.  1005]), declares that any party to a proceeding before the Commission may, as of right, become a party to 'any suit wherein is involved the validity of such order.' The section does not in terms provide that such party may institute \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 268]\n\u00a0\n a suit to challenge the order. But this is implied. For, otherwise, there would in some cases be no redress for the injury inflicted by an illegal order. Moreover, the fact of intervention, allowed as it was, implies a finding by the Commission that the plaintiffs have an interest. In the proceeding before the Commission, they opposed by evidence and argument the granting of the application. This they did as of right. For under the rules of practice, adopted by the Commission pursuant to paragraph 1 of section 17 of the Interstate Commerce Act, the intervener becomes a party to the proceeding, entitled, like any other party, to appear at the taking of testimony, to produce and cross-examine witnesses, and to be heard in person or by counsel. \n11\n The intervention must be preceded by an order of the Commission granting leave, and leave can be granted only to one showing interest. No case has been found in which either this court, or any lower court, has denied to one who was a party to the proceedings before the Commission the right to challenge the order entered therein. On the other hand, persons who were entitled to become parties before the Commission, but did not do so, have been allowed to maintain such suits where the requisite interest was shown. Interstate Commerce Commission \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 269]\n\u00a0\n v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 \nU.S. 42, 49\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 22; Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 375.12\n Third. It is contended that this bill was properly dismissed for want of jurisdiction, at least as to the terminal companies and their stockholders other than the New York Central, because the plaintiffs have joined with the suit to set aside the order, a suit to restore the status quo. The objection is not that the bill is multifarious, or that it is otherwise in conflict with established equity practice. The argument is that the United States is a necessary party; that against it suit can be brought only when Congress gives consent; that the suit was brought necessarily and solely under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 219, 220; and that the consent so given does not extend to a suit in which it is sought to set aside both the order and rights acquired by private persons thereunder. There is nothing in the legislation to indicate that Congress intended such a limitation of the scope of the relief \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 270]\n\u00a0\n to be afforded. The sale of the stock and the lease, which it is sought to set aside, were made immediately after entry of the order; that is, before expiration of the 30 days provided by paragraph 2 of section 15, and before the plaintiffs' petition to set aside or modify the order had been disposed of. To permit the joinder objected to could not prejudice the United States. To prohibit the joinder would, in large measure, defeat the very purpose of the bill, and would clearly prevent that expedition in affording relief which it was the purpose of Congress to ensure. Act Feb. 11, 1903, c. 544, 32 Stat. 823 (Comp. St.  8824, 8825). Moreover, the terminal companies, and the stockholders affected, were entitled to intervene as parties in the proceedings before the Commission, and they appeared by counsel. If they became parties to the proceeding before the Commission, they were entitled, under section 212 of the Judicial Code, to become parties, also, to any suit brought to set aside the order. It was the policy of Congress to allow persons so situated to be joined in suits to enforce provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act. See Act Feb. 19, 1903, c. 708,  2, 32 Stat. 847, 848 (Comp. St.  8598). If this suit had been brought by the United States, the court could have given the complete relief prayed for. United States v. Union Pacific Ry. Co., \n160 \nU.S. 1, 50\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 190; United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n226 \nU.S. 61, 96\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 53. The same rule should apply where the suit to set aside the order is brought by a private party. \n 13\n\u00a0\n\n The contention that the suit is barred by laches is clearly unfounded. The situation of none of the defendants appears to have been affected by the brief lapse of time. Compare United States v. Southern Pacific Co., \n259 \nU.S. 214, 240\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 496; Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogert, \n250 \nU.S. 483, 488\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 533\n\n\n Reversed. \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 271]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (dissenting).\n I think the injuries alleged to have been sustained by complainants are not such as to afford the basis for a legal remedy. Complainants are interested only in the sense that the acquisition of the rights here in question by their competitor will enable the latter to absorb a larger share of the business. That is not enough to constitute a remediable interest.\n Before Transportation Act 1920, the New York Central would have been free to acquire these terminals without the consent of the Commission. If it had done so, its gain of business, with the resulting loss to complainants, would have been the same; but it would be inadmissible to assert that complainants might have maintained a suit to annul or enjoin the acquisition on the ground of that injury. 'The effort of a carrier to obtain more business ... proceeds from the motive of self-interest, which is recognized as legitimate.' United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n263 U.S. 515\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 189, 68 L. Ed. --, decided January 7, 1924. See Johnson v. Hitchcock, 15 Johns. (N. Y.) 185.\n It is claimed, however, that Transportation Act 1920 so alters the rule as to give a right of action to complainants where none existed before. I am unable to perceive any sound basis for the conclusion. That act, so far as this question is concerned, requires the carrier, as a prerequisite to an acquisition of the character here under consideration, to secure the authorization of the Commission, which that body may grant if 'it will be in the public interest.' The mere effect of such acquisition upon the business of competing lines is no more to be considered since the act of 1920 than it was prior to the passage thereof. It is the public, not private, interest which is to be considered.\n The complainants have no standing to vindicate the rights of the public, but only to protect and enforce their \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 272]\n\u00a0\n own rights. Redress for public grievances must be sought by public agents, not by private intervention. Telephone Co. v. Railroad Commission, 174 Mich. 219, 140 N. W. 496. The right of the complainants to sue, therefore, cannot rest upon the alleged violation of a public interest, but must rest upon some distinct grievance of their own. Loss of business, or of opportunities to get business, attributable to the activity or increase of facilities on the part of a competitor, is not enough. Transportation Act 1920 lays down no new or additional rule by which the question, What constitutes a legal or equitable right, interference with which may give rise to an action? may be tested, and the determination of that question must still rest upon general principles of jurisprudence. See Peavey & Co. v. Union Pacific R. Co. (C. C.) 176 Fed. 409, 417. In Railroad v. Ellerman, \n105 U.S. 166\n, 174, this court held that a private complainant may not be heard by a court except for an--\n'invasion of some legal or equitable right. If he asserts that the competition of the railroad company damages him, the answer is that it does not abridge or impair any such right. If he alleges that the railroad company is acting beyond the warrant of the law, the answer is that a violation of its charter does not of itself injuriously affect any of his rights. The company is not shown to owe him any duty which it has not performed.'\n\n If it were conceded that the acquisition of the terminals by the New York Central was in the public interest, I suppose it would not be contended that complainants had any standing to interfere on the ground that their opportunities for obtaining business had been impaired. And, since they are without legal right to intervene to redress a public grievance, the contrary fact that the acquisition will not be in the public interest cannot avail them. Their complaint must stand or fall upon the nature of their own grievance. A private injury, for which the law \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 273]\n\u00a0\n affords no remedy, cannot be converted into a remediable injury, merely because it results from an act of which the public might complain. In other words, the law will afford redress to a litigant only for injuries which invade his own legal rights; and since the injuries here complained of are not of that character, and do not result from the violation of any obligation owing to the complainants, it follows that they are without legal standing to sue.\n The decision of the court here proceeds upon the theory that the injury complained of is a denial of equality of treatment in the use of the terminals; but I do not understand this to be the gravamen of the bill. The complaint is of inequality of opportunity to get business-not of opportunity to use the terminals. Complainants' access to the use and enjoyment of the terminal facilities acquired by the New York Central remains the same in respect of any business they may obtain. Interstate Commerce Act,  3 (3), (4), as amended by Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 479. The Commission granted the authorization only upon condition that the neutrality of the terminals in their handling of traffic should be preserved. \n14\n If their use be lessened, therefore, it will not be because access to the terminals has been, or is in danger of being, restricted, but because, with less business, there will be less occasion to use them. An illustration may be helpful: Suppose, instead of these terminal facilities, the acquisition had been of a line of railroad running west from Chicago, which, prior thereto, had been neutral and \n\n[264 U.S. 258, 274]\n\u00a0\n whose business had been distributed without favor among the several eastern lines terminating at that city. It is manifest that the effect of such an acquisition would be, as it is here, to enable the New York Central to absorb more of the traffic of the railroad so acquired than theretofore, and consequently to lessen that received by other parallel lines running east from Chicago. In that situation, could any of such lines maintain a suit to annul the authorization of the Commission? It seems to me not, and I can see no difference in principle between the case supposed and that with which we are dealing.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice SANFORD concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Baltimore & Ohio, the Pennsylvania, the Chicago & Erie, the Grand Trunk Western, the Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville, and the Pittsburg, Cincinnati, chicago & St. Louis. The Wabash, originally joined as plaintiff, was dismissed on its motion. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] neither of the operating companies affected joined in the application of the New York Central, and no separate application to the Commission was filed by either of them; but they were represented before the Commission, and the petition of the New York Central prayed that the several corporations involved be authorized to sell and to buy such stock, and to execute such lease, and that the Commission 'issue in respect thereof its certificate of public convenience and necessity.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The report, entitled 'By the Commission,' states that the authority is granted subject only to the observance of 17 conditions which it enumerates. Applications under paragraph 18 of section 1 and paragraph 2 of section 5 are customarily heard by division 4 consisting of four commissioners. See Interstate Commerce Act,  17; Annual Report of the Commission for 1920, pp. 3-6. But this case was heard by the full Commission. The Commission consists of eleven members, only four concurred entirely in what is called the report of the Commission. Four others dissented wholly. One 'concurred in part,' declaring that the 'facts warrant grant of authority without elaboration of conditions,' which (with two exceptions) seemed to him 'vain, perhaps harmful.' The two other members, concurred 'in the result reached in the report,' but declared that the opinion 'should recognize explicitly that the application should have been entertained under section 1, paragraph 18, of the act, and that in accordance therewith a certificate of public convenience and necessity should be incorporated in the order entered.' \n[\nFootnote 4\n] On May 29, 1922, the intervening carriers filed a petition praying that the order be set aside or modified. The petition was denied June 12, 1922. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The agreement of the New York Central was with the Chicago Junction Railways and Union Stockyards Company, a holding company, which owned all the stock in the Chicago River & Indiana Railroad and half of the stock in the Chicago Junction Railway; the other half being owned by Richard Fitzgerald, who wished to join in making the sale transferring control. The property to be leased included the railroad of the Union Stockyards & Transit Company of Chicago, which had theretofore been leased to the Chicago Junction Railway. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] When the cause was heard on the original bill, the hearing was upon motions to dismiss filed by the United States, the New York Central, the Chicago River & Indiana Railroad, the Chicago Junction Railways and Union Stockyards Company, the Chicago Junction Railway, and Richard Fitzgerald, and upon the answer of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The bill was then amended. Thereupon the case was heard solely on the motions to dismiss. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v.

Thus, orders on applications for extension of line, for new construction, or for abandonment under section 1, pars. 18-20, can be made only after hearing.

INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION(1924)\nNo. 288\nArgued: May 2, 1924Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. G. Wheeler and Edward M. Hyzer, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. Carter Fort, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By section 209(c) of Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 464 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 dd), the United States guarantees, for a period of six months after March 1, 1920, with respect to any carrier \n\n[265 U.S. 292, 293]\n\u00a0\n with which a contract has been made fixing the amount of just compensation under the Federal Control Act, that the railway operating income of such carrier as a whole shall not be less than one-half the amount named in such contract as annual compensation.\n By the same section, subdivision (a), the term 'carrier' is defined to mean:\n'(1) A carrier by railroad or partly by railroad and partly by water, whose railroad or system of transportation is under federal control at the time federal control terminates, ... and (2) a sleeping car company whose system of transportation is under federal control at the time federal control terminates. ...'\n\n By subdivision (g), p. 466, the Interstate Commerce Commission is directed to--\n'ascertain and certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the several amounts necessary to make good the foregoing guaranty to each carrier.'\n\n On March 15, 1920, plaintiff in error, hereafter called the Car Company, filed with the Commission its written acceptance of the provisions of section 209, and at a later time applied to the Commission for the ascertainment and certificate mentioned in subdivision (g). The Commission denied the application, upon the ground that the Car Company was not a carrier within the meaning of the act. Thereupon a mandamus was sought from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, to compel the Commission to comply with the provisions of subdivision (g), but that court, after a hearing, discharged the rule and dismissed the petition. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals this judgment was affirmed. 288 Fed. 649, 53 App. D. C. 111.\n The single question presented is whether the Car Company is a 'carrier by railroad.' Immediately prior to federal control, the Car Company owned 1,340 refrigerator cars, which were operated over various lines of railroad under contracts with the railroad companies. \n\n[265 U.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n The Car Company did not own or control any railroad property or facilities, aside from these cars. The contracts provided for payment of compensation for the use of the cars by the railroad companies on the basis of mileage- that is, a fixed sum for each mile over which the cars were run. The cars were under the control of the railroad companies, subject to the observance, on their part of the directions of the Car Company as to the distribution of the cars. The Car Company solicited freight from shippers for which it was generally paid commissions, and exercised a degree of supervision over the shipment. Sometimes cars containing shipments were delivered by noncontract railroads, from which the Car Company received payment of the mileage charges. Bills of lading covering shipments were generally made by the railroad companies; but a small percentage, perhaps 10 per centum, of the shipments originating west of Chicago were rebilled on the forms of the Car Company, subject to tariffs and classifications of the railroad companies then in effect. Waybills were made out by the railroad companies, and all freight charges were paid to the railroad companies, no payment for transportation being made by the shippers to the Car Company. The Car Company was incorporated to manufacture, sell, or rent freight cars, rolling stock and for other specified purposes; but nothing is said in its articles of incorporation in respect of any operation as a carrier. It filed no tariffs with the Commission, as interstate railroad carriers are required to do; nor did it keep its accounts in accordance with the rules of the Commission. The refrigerator cars were taken over and used by the Director General of Railroads during the period of federal control and compensation therefor paid to the Car Company. Upon the expiration of such control the cars were surrendered to the Car Company. The court below accurately summarized the testimony as showing:\n'That the Refrigerator Company is not \n\n[265 U.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n incorporated as a carrier, does not control or use the necessary facilities for performing carriage, does not hold itself out to perform carriage by publishing rates applicable thereto, and does not in fact perform carriage or receive any compensation from shippers whose shipments move in its cars. The cars are rented to railroad companies. They are subject to the control of the latter and are to all intents and purposes their property during the period of the lease. In a word, the Refrigerator Company carries nothing.'\n\n In Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 \nU.S. 175, 187\n, 188 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 93, this Court defined the words 'common carrier by railroad,' as used in the Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657-8665), to mean 'one who operates a railroad as a means of carrying for the public-that is to say, a railroad company acting as a common carrier.' If this definition be applied here, it disposes of the question against the contention of the Car Company, since it is plain that it does not operate a railroad-that is, it is not a railroad company acting as a common carrier. The contention, however, is that this definition was confined to the words as used in the Employers' Liability Act, and that they are used in the Transportation Act in a different sense. It is quite true that because words used in one statute have a particular meaning they do not necessarily denote an identical meaning when used in another and different statute. But in the Taylor Case the definition was not made to rest upon any peculiarity in the act under review, but was said to be 'in accord with the ordinary acceptation of the words,' and this ordinary meaning was enforced by a consideration of certain provisions of the act, which were enumerated.\n In Ellis v. Int. Com. Comm., \n237 U.S. 434\n, 443-444, 35 Sup. Ct. 645, it was held that the Armour Car Lines which owned, manufactured and maintained refrigerator, tank and box cars, and let them to railroads or to shippers, \n\n[265 U.S. 292, 296]\n\u00a0\n was not a common carrier subject to the Act to Regulate Commerce,  12, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 383 (Comp. St.  8576). The facts in respect of ownership of cars, use, relation to the railroads, etc., were much the same as those in the present case. After reciting them, this court said:\n'It has no control over motive power or over the movement of the cars that it furnishes as above, and in short, notwithstanding some argument to the contrary, is not a common carrier subject to the act. It is true that the definition of transportation in section 1 of the act includes such instrumentalities as the Armour Car Lines lets to the railroads. But the definition is a preliminary to a requirement that the carriers shall furnish them upon reasonable request, not that the owners and builders shall be regarded as carriers, contrary to the truth. The control of the Commission over private cars, etc., is to be effected by its control over the railroads that are subject to the act. The railroads may be made answerable for what they hire from the Armour Car Lines, if they would not be otherwise, but that does not affect the nature of the Armour Car Lines itself.'\n\n We need not review the arguments and contentions made here to the contrary. It is enough to say, that under the facts the Car Company is not a carrier by railroad, or, indeed, a common carrier at all, within the ordinary acceptation of the words, and there is nothing in the terms of the Transportation Act which suggests a different view. Such inferences as are to be drawn from the provisions of the act as pointed out by the court below, are the other way. The guaranty itself is in respect 'of railway operating income.' The Car Company's income may be 'operating income,' but certainly it is not 'railway operating income.' The income arises, not from operating a railway, but from the use of facilities let to the railway companies for fixed compensation. Stress is laid on the assertion that there is no specific language in the contracts, except in one instance, to \n\n[265 U.S. 292, 297]\n\u00a0\n the effect that the cars are leased. It is not necessary that there should be. In pursuance of the contracts the cars were delivered to, operated and controlled, and their use as instrumentalities of transportation paid for by the railroads. This is enough to establish a letting for hire; and there is nothing in the contracts or in any of the details of their performance which requires a different conclusion.\n If the Car Company is a carrier by railroad, it would seem to follow that sleeping car companies and express companies are likewise included within the words. Evidently, however, Congress did not think so, since section 209 of the act contains special provisions in respect of these companies, which would have been entirely unnecessary, if they had been so included. The contention that the Car Company, if not a carrier by railroad, is a 'system of transportation,' and hence within the words of the statutory definition, may be readily disposed of. The phrase forms part of the definition:\n'A carrier by railroad, or partly by railroad and partly by water, whose railroad or system of transportation is under federal control,' etc.\n\n It is plain that the words 'whose railroad or system of transportation' etc., are not to be read independently, but as qualifying the language immediately preceding, and they are to be taken distributively as though the clause had read 'a carrier by railroad, whose railroad is under federal control, or a carrier partly by railroad and partly by water, whose system of transportation is under federal control.'\n It follows that the judgment of the lower court is right, and it is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, B & Q R.

After a hearing by three Judges sitting under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243), it was held that the plaintiffs 'had an adequate remedy at law under the statutes of the State of Nebraska in prosecuting error proceedings to the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska' and for that reason a preliminary injunction was denied. Appeals were taken and the correctness of the above ruling is the only question here. It is not disputed that the proceedings in the Supreme Court of the State are purely judicial, so that Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 U.S. 210\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 67, does not apply to this case. Bacon v. Rutland R. R. Co., \n232 U.S. 134\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 283; Prendergast v.

When is has made its final order it certifies it to the Counties and the County treasurers thereupon issue distress warrants and notify agents of delinquent corporations to pay over all moneys of the corporation in their hands not exceeding the amount of the tax. A failure of the agent to do so is made a misdemeanor and is punished by a fine. There is no provision for a supersedeas pending proceedings before the Supreme Court, and none by which the plaintiffs can pay under protest and bring an action at law. Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n255 \nU.S. 288, 296\n, 297 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 272.

Compiled Stats. 1922,  5901\n\n\n If an action to recover the payment were allowed, the suit might be brought in the Courts of the United States, under the usual conditions, as well as in those of the State. Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Benedict, \n229 \nU.S. 481, 486\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 942. But the writ of error of course can be sued out only in the State, and a remedy in the State Courts only has been held not to be enough. Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 516\n, 18 S. Sup.

On a writ of error the Court is confined to the record. The most that it could do, it would seem, would be, if errors appeared on the face of the record, to set aside an excessive valuation and remit the matter to the same Board to try again, which is hardly satisfactory, if the Board is seeking to evade the law. United States v. Osage County, \n251 \nU.S. 128, 133\n, 134 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 100.

Lee Shee, his wife, is an alien Chinese woman, ineligible for naturalization. In 1922 she sought admission to the United States, but was refused and detained at the immigration station, on the ground that she was an alien, afflicted with a dangerous contagious disease. No question is raised as to her alienage or the effect and character of her disease; but the contention is that, nevertheless, she is entitled to admission under the proviso found in section 22 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 891, c. 29 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 l). The section is copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n A petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied by the federal District Court for the Northern District of California, and upon appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the judgment was affirmed. 287 Fed. 533.\n The pertinent words of the proviso are:\n'That if the person sending for wife or minor child is naturalized, \n\n[264 U.S. 443, 445]\n\u00a0\n a wife to whom married or a minor child born subsequent to such husband or father's naturalization shall be admitted without detention for treatment in hospital. ...'\n\n The measure of the exemption is plainly stated and, in terms, extends to the wife of a naturalized citizen only.\n But it is argued that it cannot be supposed that Congress intended to accord to a naturalized citizen a right and preference beyond that enjoyed by a native-born citizen. The court below thought that the exemption from detention was meant to relate only to a wife who by marriage had acquired her husband's citizenship, and not to one who, notwithstanding she was married to a citizen, remained an alien under section 1994, Rev. Stats. ( Comp. St.  3948):\n'Any woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a citizen of the United States, and who might herself be lawfully naturalized, shall be deemed a citizen.'\n\n To the same effect, see Ex parte Leong Shee (D. C.) 275 Fed. 364. We are inclined to agree with this view; but, in any event, the statute plainly relates only to the wife or children of a naturalized citizen and we cannot interpolate the words 'native-born citizen' without usurping the legislative function.

Dewart, both of Spokane, Wash., for appellant.\n Mr. James A. Williams, of Spokane, Wash., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under Section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) from a decree dismissing a suit in equity for want of jurisdiction. The question certified for decision arises under the provision in Section 24 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991) that:\n'No District Court shall have cognizance of any suit ... to recover upon any promissory note or other chose in action in favor of any assignee ... unless such suit might \n\n[264 U.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n have been prosecuted in such court ... if no assignment has been made.'1\n\n The appellant, a citizen of Vermont, brought suit in the Eastern District of Washington, to recover on a promissory note for $5,000 and to foreclose a mortgage on land in the latter state given to secure it. The makers and the payee of the note are citizens of Washington. The note and mortgage were assigned and transferred by the payee to the plaintiff for a valuable consideration. The mortgaged land was thereafter conveyed by the makers of the note to a citizen of Washington, who, it is alleged, in consideration of a subsequent extension of the mortgage by the plaintiff expressly assumed its payment. The purchaser thereafter died. The defendants are the executor of his will, a citizen of Washington, and the devisees, citizens of Michigan and Ohio. A deficiency judgment is prayed against the executor if the proceeds of the foreclosure prove insufficient to pay the debt. Neither the makers nor the payee of the note are sued.\n We conclude that the suit was rightly dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n\n 1. \nJurisdiction was invoked solely on the ground of diversity of citizenship. However the plaintiff's assignor, the payee of the note, being a citizen of Washington, could not have proceeded in the District Court against another citizen of the same state; and hence, under the restriction in Section 24 of the Code, nothing else appearing, the court had no jurisdiction of the suit brought by the plaintiff as assignee. Gibson v. Chew, 16 Pet. 315, 316; Kolze v. Hoadley, \n200 \nU.S. 76, 83\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 220, and cases cited. \n\n[264 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n 2. If, however, it is shown, upon allegation and proof, that the relation of the parties to a note is otherwise than appears from its terms, and that the plaintiff, although apparently assignee, is in reality the payee, the Code provision does not apply and his right to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court is not restricted by the fact that the suit could not have been prosecuted by the nominal payee. Holmes v. Goldsmith, \n147 \nU.S. 150, 159\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 288. Such is the case where the nominal payee was merely the agent of the maker for the purpose of negotiating the note and had no beneficial interest therein or right of action thereon. Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 448\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 427; Kirven v. Chemical Co., 145 Fed. 288, 290, 76 C. C. A. 172, 7 Ann. Cas. 219; Wachusett Bank v. Stove Works, 56 Fed. 321, 323; Baltimore Trust Co. v. Secreven County (D. C.) 238 Fed. 834, 836; Commercial Trust Co. v. Laurens County (D. C.) 267 Fed. 901, 903.\n To bring the suit within this exception the plaintiff alleged that in taking and assigning the note and mortgage, the payee acted as the mere broker and agent of the makers in procuring a loan from the plaintiff and neither became their creditor nor acquired any beneficial interest in the note or mortgage; but that the plaintiff was at all times the beneficial owner. The defendants denied these allegations. These issues of fact were tried by the District Judge, on evidence taken before him, from which he found that the payee, a member of a firm engaged in the mortgage loan business, did not act as agent for the makers, but for his firm, as independent dealers, and acquired the note and mortgage and afterwards sold them to the plaintiff as in 'the ordinary case where a person purchases property for resale.'\n An examination of the evidence discloses no error in this finding; on the contrary it accords with the greater weight of the testimony.\n\n 3. \nIt is urged that as the plaintiff seeks a deficiency judgment against the executor on the ground that his \n\n[264 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n testator expressly assumed payment of the mortgage to the plaintiff, the suit is maintainable in the District Court on this agreement, by reason of diversity of citizenship, without reference to the question whether the payee could have proceeded on the original note. The assignee of a chose in action, although prevented by the Code from maintaining an action thereon in the District Court, may nevertheless, if the requisite diversity of citizenship appears, proceed therein upon a new agreement subsequently made.

OF PITTSBURG v. SMITH(1924)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 152, 154]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Oliver O. Haga and James H. Richards, both of Boise, Idaho, for appellant.\n Mr. Turner K. Hackman, of Twin Falls, Idaho, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit is an incident of the partial failure of an irrigation project in the state of Idaho, called the Salmon River project, which was undertaken in accordance with the Carey Act, c. 301,  4, 28 Stat. 422 ( Comp. St.  4685), chapter 420, 29 Stat. 434, and chapter 853,  3, 31 Stat. 1188 (Comp. St.  4687), and the legislation of the state accepting the conditions of that act and providing for their performance (section 2996 et seq., Comp. Stat. Idaho 1919). A statement of the situation leading to the suit will be helpful in understanding its nature and purpose.\n The project comprehended (a) the donation by the United States to the state of 127,000 acres of arid public lands; (b) the reclamation of the lands through an agency of the state by means of extensive irrigation works drawing a supply of water from the Salmon river, and the disposal of the lands, with suitable water rights, to settlers in tracts of not more than 160 acres to any one person. Other lands, lying among the 127,000 acres, were included in the project, making a total of 150,000 acres.\n In 1907 George F. Sprague and others, who had devised the project, submitted to the state land board a proposal to construct the necessary irrigation works and to provide the requisite supply of water. In the proposal they represented that, if it was accepted, they would organize a corporation with capital sufficient to complete the works and to put the same in operation, so as to reach and reclaim all of the 150,000 acres, that the water supply intended to be utilized was ample for the purpose, and \n\n[266 U.S. 152, 155]\n\u00a0\n that water rights would be sold to settlers at $40 per acre. The representation respecting the water supply was set forth with much detail in an accompanying statement by their consulting engineer.\n The board, after referring the proposal to the state engineer and receiving from him a favorable report, provisionally accepted the proposal and forwarded it to the Secretary of the Interior with a request that the 127,000 acres of public lands be segregated from other public lands and that a contract be made between the United States and the state binding the United States to donate, grant, and patent the lands to the state, if and when the latter caused them to be reclaimed.\n The segregation was made, and on April 10, 1908, the United States and the state entered into such a contract. It provided, among other things, that the United States should patent to the state, or to its assigns, any particular tract or tracts whenever an ample supply of water to reclaim the same was actually furnished in a substantial ditch or canal; that all persons acquiring rights to such lands from the state prior to the issue of patent by the United States should take and hold the same subject to the requirements of the Carey Act and the terms of the contract; that full compliance therewith should be a condition to obtaining a right to a patent from the United States; and that the work of reclamation should be completed within 10 years.\n The state and the Twin Falls Salmon River Land & Water Company, to which Sprague and his associates had transferred their interests in the project, then entered into a contract by which that company bound itself to construct and complete the irrigation works within five years, to provide the requisite supply of water, and to sell to each settler a perpetual water right of one-hundredth of a cubic foot of water per second of time for each acre in his tract-the price of the water right to be not more \n\n[266 U.S. 152, 156]\n\u00a0\n than $40 an acre, and the water right to include a proportionate interest in the irrigation works and in the water appropriation and franchises pertaining to them. Other provisions in the contract were to the effect that no water rights should be sold in excess of the capacity of the works or of the available water supply; that the company should have a lien on each water right to secure payment of the purchase price; and that there should be no preference or priority among the holders of water rights, but all should be on the same plane, regardless of the order in which the rights were purchased. In still other provisions the state agreed to dispose of the lands to settlers at 50 cents an acre, and not to recognize any right in a settler unless and until he contracted with the company for a water right sufficient for the irrigation of the tract he was seeking. After completing the works and putting them in operation the company was to transfer their ownership and control to a corporate agency of the settlers, who were to hold its shares in the same proportion that they held the water rights. The moneys accruing from the sale of water rights were to belong to the construction company, and it was not to be otherwise compensated for its outlay and efforts. The contracts by which the water rights were sold to settlers were all of the same tenor. Besides declaring that they were made in virtue of the contract between the state and the company and that the rights of the parties were to be governed thereby, these contracts showed that the settler was to have a right to receive during each irrigation season one-hundredth of a cubic foot of water per second of time for each acre in the tract which he was seeking to acquire from the state, and also a proportionate interest in the irrigation works, etc.-such interest to conform to the proportional relation between the number of acres covered by his water right and the \n\n[266 U.S. 152, 157]\n\u00a0\n total acreage covered by all water rights sold 'in accordance with' the contract between the company and the state. The price to the settler was a definite sum calculated at the rate of $40 per acre and payable in stated installments spread over a period of 11 years. To secure payment the company was to have a lien on the water right and the land, and, if it so requested, was to be given a mortgage on the land when the settler received the legal title. If default was made in the payment of any installment, the company was to be at liberty to declare the entire amount then unpaid immediately due and payable, and to proceed to collect the same and to enforce such lien as it might have on the water right and land.\n The contracts between the United States and the state, between the state and the company, and between the company and the several settlers, all expressly recognized the laws under which they were made as parts of them.\n After the irrigation works had been partly constructed and the lands opened to entry and many water-right contracts made, it was found that the available water supply was not only short of what was required to irrigate 150,000 acres, but short of what was required to satisfy the water-right contracts already made, which aggregated 73,000 acres. In 1915 some of the settlers obtained, in a suit against the company, an interlocutory decree declaring that the outstanding water-right contracts were in excess of the available water supply and prohibiting the sale of further rights. Caldwell v. Twin Falls Salmon River Land & Water Co. (D. C.) 225 F. 584; Id., 242 F. 177, 155 C. C. A. 17; Id. (C. C. A.) 272 F. 356. In 1916 the state land board dealt with the shortage by canceling settler's entries amounting to 13,000 acres and declining to allow further entries or to approve further sales of water rights, thereby in effect requiring that the water supply by applied to not exceeding 60,000 acres. In 1918 the board, on further consideration, \n\n[266 U.S. 152, 158]\n\u00a0\n concluded that the available supply was not sufficient to irrigate more than 35,000 acres, and made an order that it be distributed over and made appurtenant to that number of irrigable acres and no more, and that the outstanding contracts for water rights in excess of that acreage be canceled.\n The shortage of water and the proceedings resulting therefrom led to many controversies between the construction company and the settlers and to a general failure on the part of the latter to pay the deferred installments of the purchase price for the water rights. The settlers insisted, and some of them satisfied a court to which they resorted, that the available water was not sufficient to irrigate more than 25,000 acres.\n Such was the situation when this suit was brought. The plaintiff is a trustee in a deed of trust given by the construction company to secure payment of a large issue of its bonds, and under that deed holds as collateral the company's rights under the contracts with the settlers and all liens to which it may be entitled under them and the legislation on which they are based. The defendants are two settlers holding contracts for water rights on which the deferred installments of the purchase price have not been paid. The plaintiff has elected to declare the full amount remaining unpaid due at once and to enforce payment accordingly. By its bill it asserts a lien on the water rights and the lands for which they were purchased, seeks a foreclosure of the lien, and asks a judgment for any deficiency. Other features of the bill will be noticed later on. In their answer the defendants admit some of the plaintiff's allegations, deny others, and assert a right to counter relief.\n On the defendants' motion the District Court ruled that the other holders of water-right contracts were necessary parties and ordered that the plaintiff bring them in. The plaintiff refused, and the bill was dismissed. The Circuit \n\n[266 U.S. 152, 159]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals affirmed the decree (273 F. 1), and the plaintiff appealed to this court under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218).\n In the briefs there is much discussion of questions which might arise if the case were here on the merits. But, as the bill was dismissed because of the refusal to bring in additional parties, the only question open here is whether the parties indicated were necessary parties. Of course they were, if they had such an interest in the matter in controversy that it could not be determined without either affecting that interest or leaving the interests of those who were before the court in a situation that might be embarrassing and inconsistent with equity. Shields v. Barrow, 17 How. 130, 139.\n The plaintiff takes the position that the suit is simply one to foreclose a distinct lien on particular water rights and lands, in which the other holders of water-right contracts have no interest, and that a final decree determining the issues in the plaintiff's favor and granting the relief sought can neither affect the other holders of such contracts nor work any embarrassment or inequity to the defendants. In our opinion that position is not tenable. The suit is much more than one for a simple foreclosure. The bill sets forth the controversy respecting the water supply and does so for the purpose of having it determined. The controversy is not peculiar to the contracts sued on but reaches and affects all that are outstanding. The contracts, while several in form, are interdependent in substance and operation. All are effectively tied together by the contract between the state and the company, in virtue of which they were made, and by what they purport to do, which is to entitle their holders to participate on equal terms in the use of a common supply of water and to invest them with proportionate interests in the works by which the water is collected and conducted to the places of use. As was well said by the District \n\n[266 U.S. 152, 160]\n\u00a0\n Judge:\n'In a very substantial sense all the settlers are parties to one general contract, in the subject-matter of which all are interested, and by virtue of which all have rights so interdependent, whether they be regarded as joint or several, that the interest of one cannot be defined and adjudicated without affecting the interests of all others.'\n\n Other considerations leading to the same result will be briefly stated.\n According to the Carey Act, a tract is not reclaimed until 'an ample supply of water is actually furnished' for its irrigation and cultivation, and only when it is reclaimed can it be charged with a lien for the cost of water rights. If, therefore, the supply of water is not adequate for the reclamation of the acreage for which water-right contracts are outstanding, and yet is adequate for the reclamation of a smaller acreage, as is asserted on one side, it is evidence that some of the contracts must be eliminated before any of the lands can be said to be reclaimed, or be adjudged subject to such a lien. Of course, an ascertainment or designation of the contracts which must fall and those which are to stand cannot be had in a suit to which their holders are not parties.\n The same thing is true as respects the elimination of contracts made in contravention of the provision in the contract between the states and the company that water rights should not be sold in excess of the available water supply.\n The bill practically disregards the stipulations fixing the price of water rights at $40 an acre and proceeds on the theory that the amount of the lien intended by the Carey Act is to be determined by distributing the total actual outlay for irrigation works, etc., with reasonable interest thereon, over all of the reclaimed lands on an acreage basis. Applying that theory, the bill alleges that if the supply of water is found to be adequate \n\n[266 U.S. 152, 161]\n\u00a0\n for 60,000 acres and no more, the amount due is to be computed at $60 an acre, and if the supply is found to be adequate only for a smaller acreage a correspondingly higher rate is to be used in the computation. This theory involves a determination of the total outlay and of the total area reclaimed. In view of what is comprehended in these questions they should be determined once for all. Every contract holder has an interest in them and will be affected by their determination, however made. It is of concern to him, not merely whether his tract is held to have been reclaimed and to be chargeable with part of the general outlay, but also whether and to what extent other lands are in the same situation. In this and other respects what is determined in respect of other holders is of direct concern to him. In short, the interests of the contract holders are so related that an effective and just determination of the questions can only be had in a proceeding to which all are parties.\n What we have said requires that the decree be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION OF PORT OF NEW YORK v. GOTTLIEB(1924)\nNo. 221\nArgued: Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 310, 311]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. George Ross Hull, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Louis Marshall and Joseph G. M. Browne, both of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondents are the wife and infant son of Solomon Gottlieb, a rabbi of a synagogue in New York City. They are natives of Palestine who sought admission to this country in December, 1921\n\n\n After a hearing before the board of special inquiry at Ellis Island, they were ordered deported, on the ground that the quota of immigrants entitled to be admitted had already been filled. Upon habeas corpus proceedings in the federal court for the Southern district of New York it was held they were entitled to admission, irrespective of quota limitations, as the wife and child of a minister, who was already here, under section 2(d) of the Act of May 19, 1921, c. 8, 42 Stat. 5, as amended by Act May 11, 1922, c. 187, 42 \n\n[265 U.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 540 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  4289 1\/2 a). Thereupon they were ordered discharged. This judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 285 Fed. 295.\n That court reached its conclusion by considering section 3 of the Act of 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874, 875 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 b), in pari materia with section 2(d) of the Act of 1921. Section 3 of the earlier act enumerates various classes of aliens who are excluded from admission into the United States, among them all persons from certain Asiatic territory with specified exceptions. The Act of 1921, as amended. is an act to limit the number of aliens who may be admitted under the immigration laws to the United States. and is declared to be 'in addition to and not in substitution for the provisions of the immigration laws.' Section 4 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  4289 1\/2 c). Section 2(d), among other things, provides that, when the maximum number of aliens of any nationality shall have been admitted, all others of such nationality applying during the same year shall be excluded, except as otherwise provided in the act. Following this, one of the provisos enumerates the aliens who are thus excepted, among them, ministers of any religious denomination. Another proviso is:\n'That in the enforcement of this act preference shall be given, so far as possible, to the wives, parents, brothers, sisters, children under 18 years of age, and of fiancees (1) of citizens of the United States; (2) of aliens now in the United States who have applied for citizenship in the manner provided by law; and (3) persons eligible to United States citizenship who have served in the military or naval forces of the United States,' etc.\n\n The court below, taking these various provisions together, held that under section 3 of the Act of 1917, these respondents were entitled to admission.\n The lower court was right in holding that the acts are in pari materia, and that section 3 of the earlier act is still fully operative and may be considered as though it formed a part of the later act. The question then is \n\n[265 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n whether it includes aliens occupying the status of these respondents. The case, as the evidence shows, is one of peculiar and distressing hardship, and it is not unnatural that any appropriate canon of construction should be laid hold of to justify a conclusion favorable to the respondents. But if the plain words of the statute are against such a conclusion, leaving no room for construction, the courts have no choice but to follow it, without regard to the consequences. Fook v. White, \n264 U.S. 443\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 361, 68 L. Ed. --, decided April 7, 1924; Zartarian v. Billings. \n204 U.S. 170\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 182; Low Wah Suey v. Backus, \n225 \nU.S. 460, 476\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 734. Section 3 of the Act of 1917 defines and enumerates the classes of aliens who are to be excluded-idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, paupers, professional beggars, diseased persons, criminals, polygamists, anarchists, prostitutes, and numerous others, the last in the enumeration being natives of islands not possessed by the United States adjacent to the continent of Asia and of the continent within certain described limits of latitude and longitude. The clause relied upon immediately follows:\n'The provision next foregoing, however, shall not apply to persons of the following status or occupations: Government officers, ministers or religious teachers, missionaries, lawyers, physicians, chemists, civil engineers, teachers, students, authors, artists, merchants, and travelers for curiosity or pleasure, nor to their legal wives or their children under sixteen years of age who shall accompany them or who subsequently may apply for admission to the United States. ...'\n\n The limited scope of this exception is apparent and no amount of discussion could make it plainer. It applies to 'the provision next foregoing,' namely, to that dealing with aliens coming from the barred Asiatic zone, and to that only.\n Section 2(d) of the Quota Law of 1921, as amended, in terms permits the admission of\n'aliens returning from a \n\n[265 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n temporary visit abroad, aliens who are professional actors, artists, lecturers, singers, nurses, ministers of any religious denomination, professors for colleges or seminaries, aliens belonging to any recognized learned profession, or aliens employed as domestic servants,' notwithstanding the quota of the same nationality has been filled. Then follows the further proviso already quoted that in the enforcement of the act 'preference shall be given, as far as possible, to the wives ... children,' etc., of certain enumerated classes.\n\n The respondents are not natives of the barred Asiatic zone, and therefore are not entitled to admission under the exception in the Act of 1917. There is nothing in the later Act of 1921, as amended, which gives the wife or children of a minister any right of entry beyond that enjoyed by aliens generally, unless he falls within one of the classes specified in the proviso to section 2(d), in which event they are to be given preference over other aliens within the limits of the quota. The quota having been exhausted, no case was presented calling for the application of the proviso, even if the respondents could otherwise have been brought within its terms. The contention that it is absurd and unreasonable to say that the wives and children of ministers from the barred Asiatic zone are to be admitted and those outside of it denied admission, does not require consideration, since the result we have stated necessarily follows from the plain words of the law, for which we are not at liberty to substitute a rule based upon other notions of policy or justice. That aliens from one part of the world shall be admitted according to their status, and those from another part according to fixed numerical proportions, is a matter wholly within the discretion of the lawmaking body, with which the courts have no authority to interfere.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMPAGNIE INTERNATIONALE DE PRODUITS ALIMENTAIRES, S A, v.

St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  6336 1\/8 e]):\n'That, in lieu of the tax imposed by section 210 of the Revenue Act of 1918, there shall be levied, collected, and paid for each taxable year upon the net income of every individual a normal tax of 8 per centum of the amount of the net income in excess of the credits provided in section 216: Provided, that in the case of a citizen or resident of the United States the rate upon the first $4,000 of such excess amount shall be 4 per centum.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[265 U.S. 47, 54]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff is a native citizen of the United States, and was such when he took up his residence and became domiciled in the city of Mexico. A demand was made upon him by defendant in error, designated defendant, to make a return of his income for the purpose of taxation under the revenue laws of the United States. Plaintiff complied with the demand, but under protest; the income having been derived from property situated in the city of Mexico. A tax was assessed against him in the sum of $1,193.38, the first installment of which he paid, and for it, as we have said this action was brought.\n\n The question in the case, and which was presented by the demurrer to the declaration is, as expressed by plaintiff, whether Congress has power to impose a tax upon income received by a native citizen of the United States who, at the time the income was received, was permanently resident and domiciled in the city of Mexico, the income being from real and personal property located in Mexico.\n Plaintiff assigns against the power, not only his rights under the Constitution of the United States, but under international law, and in support of the assignments cites many cases. It will be observed that the foundation of the assignments is the fact that the citizen receiving the income and the property of which it is the product are outside of the territorial limits of the United States. These two facts, the contention is, exclude the existence of the power to tax. Or to put the contention another way, to the existence of the power and its exercise, the person receiving the income and the property from which he receives it must both be within the territorial limits of the United States to be within the taxing power of the United States. The contention is not justified, and that it is not justified is the necessary deduction of recent cases. In United States v. Bennett, \n232 U.S. 299\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 433, the power of the United States to tax a foreign-built yacht owned and used during the taxing period outside of the \n\n[265 U.S. 47, 55]\n\u00a0\n United States by a citizen domiciled in the United States was sustained. The tax passed on was imposed by a tariff act,2 but necessarily the power does not depend upon the form by which it is exerted.\n It will be observed that the case contained only one of the conditions of the present case, the property taxed was outside of the United States. In United States v. Goelet, 232 U.  293, 34 Sup. Ct. 431, the yacht taxed was outside of the United States, but owned by a citizen of the United States who was 'permanently resident and domiciled in a foreign country.' It was decided that the yacht was not subject to the tax-but this was a matter of construction. Pains were taken to say that the question of power was determined 'wholly irrespective' of the owner's 'permanent domicile in a foreign country,' and the court put out of view the situs of the yacht. That the court had no doubt of the power to tax was illustrated by reference to the income tax laws of prior years and their express extension to those domiciled abroad. The illustration has pertinence to the case at bar, for the case at bar is concerned with an income tax, and the power to impose it.\n We may make further exposition of the national power as the case depends upon it. It was illustrated at once in United States v. Bennett by a contrast with the power of a state. It was pointed out that there were limitations upon the latter that were not on the national power. The taxing power of a state, it was decided, encountered at its borders the taxing power of other states and was limited by them. There was no such limitation, it was pointed \n\n[265 U.S. 47, 56]\n\u00a0\n out, upon the national power, and that the limitation upon the states affords, it was said, no ground for constructing a barrier around the United States, 'shutting that government off from the exertion of powers which inherently belong to it by virtue of its sovereignty.'\n The contention was rejected that a citizen's property without the limits of the United States derives no benefit from the United States. The contention, it was said, came from the confusion of thought in 'mistaking the scope and extent of the sovereign power of the United States as a nation and its relations to its citizens and their relation to it.' And that power in its scope and extent, it was decided, is based on the presumption that government by its very nature benefits the citizen and his property wherever found, and that opposition to it holds on to citizenship while it 'belittles and destroys its advantages and blessings by denying the possession by government of an essential power required to make citizenship completely beneficial.' In other words, the principle was declared that the government, by its very nature, benefits the citizen and his property wherever found, and therefore has the power to make the benefit complete. Or, to express it another way, the basis of the power to tax was not and cannot be made dependent upon the situs of the property in all cases, it being in or out of the United States, nor was not and cannot be made dependent upon the domicile of the citizen, that being in or out of the United States, but upon his relation as citizen to the United States and the relation of the latter to him as citizen. The consequence of the relations is that the native citizen who is taxed may have domicile, and the property from which his income is derived may have situs, in a foreign country and the tax be legal-the government having power to impose the tax.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The following regulation, No. 62, promulgated by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue under the Revenue Act of 1921, provides in article 3: 'Citizens of the United States except those entitled to the benefits of section 262, ... wherever resident, are liable to the tax.

Some time prior to the delivery appellant had entered into contracts with certain railroad companies to supply them with coal for specified periods of time and at stated prices. Upon the passing of the railroads into the control of the government, by virtue of the President's proclamation of December 26, 1917, 40 Stat. 1733, the Railroad Administration claimed the right to enforce these contracts. The right was denied, whereupon the Fuel Administration requisitioned the coal 'without prejudice to your [appellant's] right to assert a claim against the Railroad Administration or these various railroad companies,' for any amount claimed to be legally payable. The Railroad Administration paid the prices fixed by the contracts, asserting that these were the measure of its liability. The general price for coal theretofore fixed by the Fuel Administration was more than the contract price, and this action was for the difference. The court below sustained a demurrer to the petition and dismissed it. After the rendition of judgment and before the appeal to this court, appellant brought actions in the federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against James C. Davis, as Agent for the President under the Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 456, c. 91 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 et seq.]), the causes of action therein set forth being the same as that set forth in the present case. These alleged causes of action arose out of the possession, use, and operation by the President of the railroads in question and come within the provisions of section 206 (a) of the act, 41 Stat. 461, c. 91.\n The government has submitted a motion to dismiss the appeal relying upon the provisions of section 154 of the Judicial Code, (Comp. St.  1145 ), which reads:\n'No person shall file or prosecute in the Court of Claims, or in the Supreme Court on appeal therefrom, \n\n[263 U.S. 537, 540]\n\u00a0\n any claim for or in respect to which he or any assignee of his has pending in any other court any suit or process against any person who, at the time when the cause of action alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect thereto, acting or professing to act, mediately or immediately, under the authority of the United States.'\n\n At the time the alleged causes of action arose the President was acting under the authority of the United States, and the actions being against an agent appointed by and acting for him, fall within the terms of the statute just quoted. It is urged, however, that the actions were brought, ex necessitate rei, because they were about to become barred by expiration of the statutory period of limitation, and that, for this and other reasons, the case is not within the spirit of section 154 properly construed. But the words of the statute are plain, with nothing in the context to make their meaning doubtful; no room is left for construction, and we are not at liberty to add an exception in order to remove apparent hardship in particular cases.

Another award of $25 per month was made to him, as such guardian, on account of the busband's death.\n Payments were regularly made until July 12, 1921, when the Bureau of War Risk Insurance gave notice that the beneficiary had terminated her claims for both insurance and compensation by misconduct. Thereupon the guardian commenced this proceeding in the District Court. The petition prays for judgment against the United States and that they be directed to pay all installments which have or may accrue. The trial judge concluded that by misconduct the widow had terminated her right to the insurance as of September 17, 1920; further, that the United States had not consented to be sued upon the award of compensation; and it dismissed the petition, April 7, 1922.

All the trustees have died or resigned pending the litigation, and Cunningham, having been substituted for the last survivor, is now the sole trustee. The actions were tried together in the District Court, and were argued together in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and all the bills were dismissed in both courts. The facts and defenses are the same in all the cases, except that, in that of Benjamin Brown, there was an additional defense that he was a minor when the transactions occurred. We have brought the cases into this court by writ of certiorari.\n The litigation grows out of the remarkable criminal financial career of Charles Ponzi. In December, 1919, with a capital of $150, he began the business of borrowing money on his promissory notes. He did not profess to receive money for investment for account of the lender. He borrowed the money on his credit only. He spread the false tale that on his own account he was engaged in buying international postal coupons in foreign countries and selling them in other countries at 100 per cent. profit, and that this was made possible by the excessive differences in the rates of exchange following the war. He was willing, he said, to give others the opportunity to share with him this profit. By a written promise in 90 days to pay them $ 150 for every $100 loaned, he induced thousands to lend him. He stimulated their avidity by \n\n[265 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n paying his 90-day notes in full at the end of 45 days, and by circulating the notice that he would pay any unmatured note presented in less than 45 days at 100 per cent. of the loan. Within eight months he took in $9,582, 000, for which he issued his notes for $14,374,000. He paid his agents a commission of 10 per cent. With the 50 per cent. promised to lenders, every loan paid in full with the profit would cost him 60 per cent. He was always insolvent, and became daily more so, the more his business succeeded. He made no investments of any kind, so that all the money he had at any time was solely the result of loans by his dupes.\n The defendants made payments to Ponzi as follows:\n Benjamin Brown, July 20th $ 600 Benjamin Brown, July 24th 600 H. W. Crockford, July 24th 1,000 Patrick W. Horan, July 24th 1,600 Frank W. Murphy, July 22d 600 Thomas Powers, July 24th 500 H. P. Holbrook, July 22d 1,000\n\n By July 1st, Ponzi was taking in about $1,000,000 a week. Because of an investigation by public authority, Ponzi ceased selling notes on July 26th, but offered and continued to pay all unmatured notes for the amount originally paid in, and all matured notes which had run 45 days, in full. The report of the investigation caused a run on Ponzi's Boston office by investors seeking payment, and this developed into a wild scramble when, August 2d, a Boston newspaper, most widely circulated, declared Ponzi to be hopelessly insolvent, with a full description of the situation, written by one of his recent employees. To meet this emergency, Ponzi concentrated all his available money from other banks in Boston and New England in the Hanover Trust Company, a banking concern in Boston, which had been his chief depository. There was no evidence of any general \n\n[265 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n attempt by holders of unmatured notes to secure payment prior to the run which set in after the investigation July 26th.\n The money of the defendants was paid by them between July 20th and July 24th and was deposited in the Hanover Trust Company. At the opening of business July 19th, the balance of Ponzi's deposit accounts at the Hanover Trust Company was $334,000. At the close of business July 24th it was $871,000. This sum was exhausted by withdrawals of July 26th of $572, 000, of July 27th of $228,000, and of July 28th of $905,000, or a total of more than $1,765,000. In spite of this, the account continued to show a credit balance, because new deposits from other banks were made by Ponzi. It was finally ended by an overdraft on August 9th of $331,000. The petition in bankruptcy was then filed. The total withdrawals from July 19th to August 10th were $6,692,000. The claims which have been filed against the bankrupt estate are for the money lent, and not for the 150 per cent. promised.\n Both courts held that the defendants had rescinded their contracts of loan for fraud and that they were entitled to a return of their money; that other dupes of Ponzi who filed claims in bankruptcy must be held not to have rescinded, but to have remained creditors, so that what the latter had paid in was the property of Ponzi; that the presumption was that a wrongdoing trustee first withdrew his own money from a fund mingled with that of his cestui que trustent, and therefore that the respective deposits of the defendants were still in the bank and available for return to them in rescission; and that payments to them of these amounts were not preferences, but merely the return of their own money.\n We do not agree with the courts below. The outstanding facts are not really in dispute. It is only in the interpretation of those facts that our difference of view arises. \n\n[265 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n In the first place, we do not agree that the action of the defendants constituted a rescission for fraud and a restoration of the money lent on that ground. As early as April, his secretary testifies that Ponzi adopted the practice of permitting any who did not wish to leave his money for 45 days to receive it back in full without interest, and this was announced from time to time. Two of the defendants expressly testified to this. It was reiterated in the public press in July and by the investigating public authorities. There is no evidence that these defendants were consciously rescinding a contract for fraud. Certainly Ponzi was not returning their money on any admission of fraud. The lenders merely took advantage of his agreement to pay his unmatured notes at par of the actual loan. Such notes were paid under his agreement exactly as his notes which were matured were paid at par and 50 per cent. The real transaction between him and those who were seeking him is shown by the fact that there were 500 to whom he gave checks in compliance with his promise, and who were defeated merely because there were no more funds.\n The District Court found that, when these defendants were paid on and after August 2d, they had reason to believe that Ponzi was insolvent. The statute (section 60b of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by Act June 25, 1910, c. 412, 36 St. 838, 842 [Comp. St.  9644]), requires that, in order that a preference should be avoided, its beneficiary must have reasonable cause to believe that the payment to him will effect a preference; that is, that the effect of the payment will be to enable him to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than others of the creditors of the insolvent of the same class. The requirement is fully satisfied by the evidence in this case, no matter where the burden of proof. On the morning of August 2d, when news of Ponzi's insolvency was broadly announced, there was a scramble and \n\n[265 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n a race. The neighborhood of the Hanover Bank was crowded with people trying to get their money, and for eight days they struggled. Why? Because they feared that they would be left only with claims against an insolvent debtor. In other words, they were seeking a preference by their diligence. Thus they came into the teeth of the Bankruptcy Act, and their preferences in payment are avoided by it.\n But, even if we assume that the payment of these unmatured notes was not according to the contract with Ponzi, and that what the defendants here did was a rescission for fraud, we do not find them in any better case. They had one of two remedies to make them whole. They could have followed the money wherever they could trace it and have asserted possession of it on the ground that there was a resulting trust in their favor, or they could have established a lien for what was due them in any particular fund of which he had made it a part. These things they could do without violating any statutory rule against preference in bankruptcy, because they then would have been endeavoring to get their own money, and not money in the estate of the bankrupt. But to succeed they must trace the money, and therein they have failed. It is clear that all the money deposited by these defendants was withdrawn from deposit some days before they applied for and received payment of their unmatured notes. It is true that by the payment into the account of money coming from other banks and directly from other dupes the bank account as such was prevented from being exhausted; but it is impossible to trace into the Hanover deposit of Ponzi after August 1st, from which defendants' checks were paid, the money which they paid him into that account before July 26th. There was, therefore, no money coming from them upon which a constructive trust, or an equitable lien could be fastened. Schuyler v. Little-field, \n232 U.S. 707\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 466; In re \n\n[265 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n Mulligan (D. C.) 116 Fed. 715; In re Matthews' Sons, 238 Fed. 785, 151 C. C. A. 635; In re Stenning, \n\n[265 U.S. 1, 1895]\n\u00a0\n 2 Ch. 433. In such a case, the defrauded lender becomes merely a creditor to the extent of his loss and a payment to him by the bankrupt within the prescribed period of four months is a preference. Clarke v. Rogers, \n228 U.S. 534\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 587, 57 L. E. 953. In re Door, 196 Fed. 292, 116 C. C. A. 112; In re Kearney (D. C.) 167 Fed. 995.\n Lord Chancellor Eldon, in Clayton's Case, \n\n[265 U.S. 1, 1816]\n\u00a0\n Ch. 1 Merivale, 572, held that, in a fund in which were mingled the moneys of several defrauded claimants insufficient to satisfy them all, the first withdrawals were to be charged against the first deposits, and the claimants were entitled to be paid in the inverse order in which their moneys went into the account. Ponzi's withdrawals from his account with the Hanover Trust Company on July 26, 27, and 28 were made before defendants had indicated any purpose to rescind. Ponzi then had a defeasible title to the money he had received from them, and could legally withdraw it. By the end of July 28th he had done so, and had exhausted all that was traceable to their deposits. The rule in Clayton's Case has no application.\n The courts below relied on the rule established by the English Court of Appeals in Knatchbull v. Hallett, L. R. 13 Ch. D. 696, in which it was decided by Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, and one of his colleagues, that, where a fund was composed partly of a defrauded claimant's money and partly of that of the wrongdoer, it would be presumed that in the fluctuations of the fund it was the wrongdoer's purpose to draw out the money he could legally and honestly use rather than that of the claimant, and that the claimant might identify what remained as his res, and assert his right to it by way of an equitable lien on the whole fund, or a proper pro rata share of it. National Bank v. Insurance Co., \n104 U.S. 54\n, 68; Hewitt v. Hayes, 205 Mass. 356, 91 N. E. 332, 137 Am. St. Rep. 448. To make the rule applicable here, we must infer that in the deposit and withdrawal \n\n[265 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n of more than $3,000,000 between the deposits of the defendants prior to July 28th, and the payment of their checks after August 2d, Ponzi kept the money of defendants on deposit intact and paid out only his subsequent deposits. Considering the fact that all this money was the result of fraud upon all his dupes, it would be running the fiction of Knatchbull v. Hallett into the ground to apply it here. The rule is useful to work out equity between a wrongdoer and a victim; but, when the fund with which the wrongdoer is dealing is wholly made up of the fruits of the frauds perpetrated against a myriad of victims, the case is different. To say that, as between equally innocent victims, the wrongdoer, having defeasible title to the whole fund, must be presumed to have distinguished in advance between the money of those who were about to rescind and those who were not, would be carrying the fiction to a fantastic conclusion.\n After August 2d the victims of Ponzi were not to be divided into two classes, those who rescinded for fraud and those who were relying on his contract to pay them. They were all of one class, actuated by the same purpose to save themselves from the effect of Ponzi's insolvency. Whether they sought to rescind, or sought to get their money as by the terms of the contract, they were, in their inability to identify their payments, creditors, and nothing more. It is a case the circumstances of which call strongly for the principle that equality is equity, and this is the spirit of the bankrupt law. Those who were successful in the race of diligence violated not only its spirit, but its letter, and secured an unlawful preference.\n We do not see that a minor whose money could not be identified is in a better situation that that of the other defendants. Like them, on August 2d, he was only a creditor of Ponzi, and was moved to avoid insolvency by a preference just as they were. A minor is not exempt \n\n[265 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n from the defeat of an unlawful preference by section 60b of the Bankruptcy Act as amended.\n The decrees are reversed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v.

This action against Davis, the Agent of the President designated under Transportation Act of 1290 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 et seq.), was brought in a state court of Montana to recover damages for failure to supply the cars. The plaintiff sued on an express contract to furnish them on the day named. It was not shown, or contended, that the published tariffs governing the contemplated shipment provided in terms for such a contract. The defendant asked for a directed verdict; the request was refused; and the jury was instructed that, if the promise was made, the defendant was liable for its breach, even if the carrier was unable to furnish the cars. A verdict was rendered for the plaintiff; the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the highest court of the state; and the case is here on writ of certiorari under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1214). \n262 U.S. 740\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 700. Whether, under the Interstate Commerce Act as amended, the express promise to furnish cars was valid is the only question requiring decision.\n The transportation service to be performed was that of common carrier under published tariffs, not a special service under a special contract, as in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. Maucher, \n248 U.S. 359\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 108. The agent's promise that the cars would be available on the day named was introduced to establish an absolute obligation to supply the cars, not as evidence that the shipper had given due notice of the time when the cars would be needed, or as evidence that the carrier had not made reasonable efforts to supply the cars. The obligation of the common carrier implied in the tariff is to use diligence to provide, upon reasonable notice, cars for loading at the time desired. A contract to furnish cars on a day certain imposes a greater obligation than that implied in the tariff. For, under the contract, proof of due diligence would not excuse failure to perform. \n\n[264 U.S. 560, 562]\n\u00a0\n Chicago & Alton R. R. Co. v. Kirby, \n225 U.S. 155\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 501, settled that a special contract to transport a car by a particular train, or on a particular day, is illegal, when not provided for in the tariff. That the thing contracted for in this case was a service preliminary to the loading is not a difference of legal significance. The contract to supply cars for loading on a day named provides for a special advantage to the particular shipper, as much as a contract to expedite the cars when loaded. It was not necessary to prove that a preference resulted in fact. The assumption by the carrier of the additional obligation was necessarily a preference. The objection is not only lack of authority in the station agent. The paramount requirement that tariff provisions be strictly adhered to, so that shippers may receive equal treatment, presents an insuperable obstacle to recovery. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Saitta & Jones v.

Montgomery, of New Orleans, La., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 219, 221]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On March 3, 1923, the Director General of Railroads sued the respondent Coal Company in a City Court of New Orleans, for damages done by it to a railroad wharf on January 9, 1920, while the wharf was under federal control. The Coal Company pleaded the prescription of one year under the statutes of Louisiana. Civil Code, art. 3536. This defence was upheld by the City Court and by the Court of Appeals and a review was denied by the Supreme Court on the ground that the ruling below \n\n[265 U.S. 219, 222]\n\u00a0\n was correct. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n264 U.S. 578\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 403, 68 L. Ed. --.\n In E. I. Dupont De Nemours & Co. v. Davis, \n264 U.S. 456\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 364, 68 L. Ed. --, April 7, 1924, it was held that the Director General was not barred by the statutes of the United States in an action on behalf of the United States in its governmental capacity to recover upon a liability arising out of his control. The familiar rule was repeated that the United States should not be held to have waived any sovereign right or privilege unless it was plainly so provided. The reasoning of that case excludes the notion that there was any intentional waiver by the United States of its sovereign right to collect its claims, irrespective of any statute, 'as soon as practicable.' The provision of section 10 of the Federal Control Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451, 456 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 j), subjecting carriers 'to all laws and liabilities as common carriers, whether arising under State or Federal laws or at common law, except,' etc., rightly was said by the counsel for the petitioner to do no more than subject operations of the carriers to existing laws, not to adopt from the States their several limitations to suits that this Government might bring, while the United States applied no limitations of its own. The distinction in the statute between carriers and the Government is pointed out in the above cited case. Also it is established that a state statute of limitations cannot bar the United States, at least when a suit is brought in the United States courts. United States v. Thompson, \n98 U.S. 486\n; United States v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co., \n118 U.S. 120\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 1006; Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Co. v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 123, 125\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 407. The only question that requires a further word is whether thn Courts below were right in thinking that the lex fori imposed a different rule if the United States saw fit to sue in a state court.\n Perhaps it was not quite fully remembered that the laws of the United States are a part of the lex fori of a \n\n[265 U.S. 219, 223]\n\u00a0\n State. But however that may be, it has been decided by a series of cases that when the courts of a State are given general jurisdiction over a certain class of controversies the power of the State over its own courts cannot be used to exclude a party from what otherwise is a constitutional right.

If the section of the Louisiana Code after the limitation that it expresses went on to say that the United States is forbidden to sue in the courts of the State upon such claims over a year old, although but for this limitation it might, the exception could not be maintained. But we hardly believe that if the matter were baldly presented the Code would be construed in that way. The ruling below was based upon the belief, since shown to be mistaken, that the United States had waived its immunity from the state laws.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v.

Davis, Agent, etc, has been substituted-and another, wherein he asked to recover for damage sustained by his vessel when in collision with the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company's car float No. 46. He alleged that the collision resulted solely from negligence of the float and those in charge of her; that the President took possession of all systems of transportation December 28, 1917, through the Director General; and 'that at all the times herein mentioned the car float No. 46 was managed, operated, and owned by the said New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company under the control or operation of the said Director General of Railroads.'\n The 'Director General of Railroads of the United States (New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad)' answered and denied liability. \n\n[265 U.S. 257, 262]\n\u00a0\n It appeared from the evidence that while moored at Pier 2, Erie Basin, March 28, 1919, the Mary Ethel suffered damage by contact with car float No. 46 of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad, negligently cast loose by a New York Central Railroad tug. Both railroads and the tug were then being operated by the Director General.\n The District Court found and held:\n'The last intervening cause of the accident which occurred to the Mary Ethel was the fact that the New York Central came in and after removing the New York Central barge allowed the No. 46 to go adrift, but that fact will not relieve the Director General, operating the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad from liability, inasmuch as he is the same entity that is operating the New York Central.'\n\n A decree for the libelant was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. It said:\n'The contention of appellant is that, 'even though it be admitted that the New York Central tug was under the control and operation of the Director General of Railroads operating the New York Central Railroad, the Director General of Railroads operating the New Haven Railroad, being a separate and distinct person, is in no way responsible.'\n\n'Appellant seeks to avoid the decision of this court in Globe & Rutgers Fire Ins.

Du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Davis (April 7, 1924), \n264 U.S. 456\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 364, 68 L. Ed. --.\n Section 10 of the Federal Control Act, approved March 21, 1918 (40 Stat. 451, 456, c. 25 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 j]), provides that carriers under federal control shall be subject to liability as common carriers under state and federal laws, and that in actions against them no defense shall be made upon the ground that the carrier is an instrumentality of the federal government.\n General Order 50a of the Director General, issued January 11, 1919, directs that actions at law, suits in equity, or proceedings in admiralty growing out of operation of any system of transportation which might have been brought against the carrier, but for federal control, shall be brought against the Director General, and not otherwise; that service of process may be made upon officials operating a railroad for the Director General as formerly permitted in actions against the road; and, further, 'the pleadings in all such actions at law, suits in equity, or proceedings in admiralty, now pending against any carrier company for a cause of action arising since December 31, 1917, based upon a cause of action arising from or out of the operation of any railroad or other carrier, may on application be amended by substituting the Director General of Railroads for the carrier company as party defendant and dismissing the company therefrom.' \n\n[265 U.S. 257, 264]\n\u00a0\n The effect of section 10 and General Order 50a were discussed in Missouri Pacific R. R. v. Ault, \n256 \nU.S. 554, 560\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 593, and it was there pointed out that while the transportation systems were controlled and administered by the United States they were treated as separate entities, 'regarded much as ships are regarded in admiralty,' and 'dealt with as active responsible parties answerable for their own wrongs.'\n As well pointed out in Manbar Coal Co. v. Davis, Agent (Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, March 10, 1924) 297 Fed. 24, no one was given the right to sue the Director General as operator of all railroads, but his liability was carefully limited to such as would have been incurred by some particular carrier if there had been no federal control.\n Here the Director General came into court to defend only against a liability asserted because of the negligence of agents operating the New York, New Haven & Hartford system, and not because of anything which might have been done or omitted by those of another system. In such circumstances, under the statute and orders, we think the court could adjudge no liability against him, except such as might have been enforced against the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company before federal control. Under those conditions the United States consented to be proceeded against. One reason therefor, if any is necessary, seems plain enough. Every system was operated as an entity; its agents and employes knew and carried on its ordinary affairs, but not those of other carriers. The Director General necessarily relied upon the organization of each system, and could demand notice sufficient to set the proper one in motion; otherwise, proper defenses might not be presented.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v.

The cause of action alleged was failure to furnish a car within a reasonable time after notice. The carrier defended on the ground that the shipper had not complied with a rule, approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and contained in its tariff, which provided that orders for cars must be placed with the local agent in writing. Written notice was not given. The plaintiff was permitted to testify that he had notified the station agent orally and that the latter had accepted his oral notice. The trial court refused to instruct the jury that the shipper could not recover without proving a notice in writing. Exceptions were duly taken. The plaintiff got the verdict; and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the highest court of the state. 157 Ark. 43, 247 S. W. 1070.

St.  8657), brought by the administratrix of David Kennedy to recover damages for his death upon a railroad while under federal control. The death was caused by a collision between two trains called No. 1 and No. 4, west of a point known as Shops which was two and a half miles west of Nashville, Tennessee. The tracks were double from Nashville to Shops but after that the track was single. No. 1, bound for Nashville, had the right of way, and the crew of No. 4, bound westward, had instructions never to pass Shops unless they knew as a fact that No. 1 had passed it. Kennedy was the engineer of No. 4. The conductor had told him that the train was crowded and had asked him to look out for No. 1, which Kennedy agreed to do. He ran his train on beyond Shops however and the collision occurred.\n The trial was in a Court of the State of Tennessee, and the plaintiff got, a judgment which was sustained by the Supreme Court of the State on the ground that the other members of the crew as well as the engineer were bound to look out for the approaching train and that their negligence contributed as a proximate cause to the engineer's death. We are of opinion that this was error. It was the personal duty of the engineer positively to ascertain whether the other train had passed. His duty was primary as he had physical control of No. 4, and was managing its course. It seems to us a perversion of the statute to allow his representative to recover for an in \n\n[266 U.S. 147, 149]\n\u00a0\n jury directly due to his failure to act as required on the ground that possibly it might have been prevented if those in secondary relation to the movement had done more.

The injury occurred at Council Bluffs, Iowa, where he then resided. He brought this action in the district court of Douglas county, Nebraska, to recover damages for his injuries. His petition did not show \n\n[266 U.S. 314, 316]\n\u00a0\n where the injury occurred or where he lived when injured. The Director General appeared specially for the purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of the court 'over the person of the defendant and over the subject matter of this action,' and moved to quash the summons; the grounds alleged were 'that General Orders Nos. 50, 50-A, 18, 18-A, and 18- B,1 issued by the Director General, ... provide that all suits against the Director General of Railroads, as authorized by General Order No. 50-A, must be brought in the county or district where the plaintiff resided at the time of the accrual of the cause of action, or in the county or district where the cause of action arose'; that plaintiff, at the time of the accrual of the cause of action, did not reside in Douglas county, Nebraska, and that the cause of action, did not arise there. Plaintiff did not deny the allegations on which the motion was based. The district court overruled the motion without more. The defendant answered setting up the same objection to jurisdiction and his defenses on the merits. Later, plaintiff filed an amended petition; and to that defendant filed answer, in which he again asserted his objection to jurisdiction. At the trial, after the evidence was heard, the court upon its own motion instructed the jury to return a verdict for defendant; and judgment was entered in his favor. The plaintiff made a motion for a new trial which was denied. He then appealed to the Supreme Court. Defendant's objection to the jurisdiction was urged by brief filed by leave of court specially given. But the question was not decided, because defendant had not taken a cross- appeal. O'Hara v. Hines, 108 Neb. 74, 81, 187 N. W. 643. The judgment of the district court was reversed on the merits. At the new trial plaintiff testified that his injuries occurred at Council Bluffs, Iowa, and that he resided there when he was injured. \n\n[266 U.S. 314, 317]\n\u00a0\n The defendant, by appropriate objections and motions made at the time of impaneling the jury, at the close of plaintiff's evidence, and at the close of all the evidence, insisted upon its objection to the jurisdiction of the court, but all were overruled. There was a verdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed to the Supreme Court. A syllabus (by the court) contains the following:\n'Where the Director General specially appears to object to the jurisdiction of the court over his person, and at the same time challenges the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter of the controversy, as to which the motion is not well founded, this is a voluntary appearance equivalent to the service of summons, and gives the court jurisdiction over the person of such officer.' O'Hara v. Davis, 109 Neb. 615, 192 N. W. 215.\n\n The judgment appealed from was affirmed.\n Section 10 of the Federal Control Act, 40 Stat. 456 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 j), provides that:\n'Carriers while under federal control shall be subject to all laws and liabilities as common carriers ... except in so far as may be inconsistent with ... any order of the President. ...'\n\n The General Orders are in legal effect orders of the President, and are valid. \n2\n This is an action against the United States. The railroads were taken over and operated by it in its sovereign capacity, and it will not be held to have waived any sovereign right or privilege unless it has plainly done so.

This court is not bound by the decision of the state court that defendant waived his federal right under the act and the orders of the Director General, and it may determine for itself whether he sufficiently asserted and insisted upon that right.

Ct. 613; Creswill v. Knights of Pythias, \n225 \nU.S. 246, 261\n, 32 S. Ct. 822\n\n\n Defendant's special appearance and motion did not amount to an objection to the jurisdiction over the subject-matter; that is, it did not raise the question whether, considering the nature of the cause of action asserted and the relief prayed by plaintiff, the court had power to adjudicate concerning the subject-matter of the class of cases to which plaintiff's claim belonged. Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 316; Reynolds v. Stockton, \n140 \nU.S. 254, 268\n, 11 S. Ct. 773. The stated purpose of the special appearance was broader than the grounds alleged and, in so far as it related to the subject-matter, was not carried into effect. There was nothing in the moving papers to suggest that the Nebraska court had no jurisdiction to try and determine actions, founded on negligence, to recover damages for personal injuries suffered by railway employees while engaged in the performance of their work. Undoubtedly, the district court of Douglas county would have had jurisdiction if the accident happened in that county or district, or if plaintiff resided there at the time he was injured. The General Orders on which defendant's motion rested did not relate to jurisdiction of the subject-matter; and the Supreme Court of Nebraska so held. The substance of the objection stated and the grounds alleged should control, rather than the declaration of purpose. See Bankers' Life Insurance Co. v. Robbins, 59 Neb. 170, 173, 80 N. W. 484; Omaha National Bank v. Farmers' & Merchants' Bank, 45 Neb. 29, 32, 63 N. W. 128; Perrine v. Knights Templar \n\n[266 U.S. 314, 319]\n\u00a0\n (rehearing) 71 Neb. 273, 275, 101 N. W. 1017. And, even if the motion amounted to an objection to jurisdiction over subject-matter, it cannot reasonably be held that it gave the court jurisdiction. Under the statutes and practice in Nebraska, defendant was not required to appear specially to object to jurisdiction over his person. Where, as in this case, the defects do not appear on the face of the petition, objection to jurisdiction over the person of the defendant and over the subject-matter of the action may be taken by answer setting up defenses on the merits, without or after prior objection by special appearance and motion. Section 8612, Compiled Statutes 1922. Hurlburt v. Palmer, 39 Neb. 158, 178, 179, 57 N. W. 1019; Kyd v. Exchange Bank of Cortland, 56 Neb. 557, 561, 76 N. W. 1058; Baker v. Union Stockyards Nat. Bank, 63 Neb. 801, 803, 89 N. W. 269, 93 Am. St. Rep. 484; Templin v. Kimsey, 74 Neb. 614, 105 N. W. 89. And the rule that objections to jurisdiction over the person are waived by general appearance does not apply. It follows that, in such cases, there is no reason for holding that an unfounded objection to jurisdiction over the subject-matter, in a special appearance and motion to quash the summons, waives objections to jurisdiction over the person. We hold that defendant did not by his motion waive his right to immunity from suit on plaintiff's claim in the Nebraska court or voluntarily appear and give that court jurisdiction.\n As additional reasons for its conclusion, the Supreme Court said that the special appearance and motion to quash the summons were properly overruled, because there was no evidence to support the motion; that no objection was made during the first trial to the jurisdiction of the court, and that no motion for rehearing was made in that court after the filing of its opinion on the first appeal, 'and the former decision of the court has become the law of the case.'\n The facts on which the defendant's motion was based were not denied by plaintiff. The order of the district \n\n[266 U.S. 314, 320]\n\u00a0\n court states that 'being fully advised in the premises, the court does overrule said special appearance. ...' The order overruling the motion was made March 13, 1920, some time before the decisions of this court which declared the validity and effect of the general orders on which plaintiff's motion was based. Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Ault, supra, was decided June 1, 1921. Alabama, etc., Ry. Co. v. Journey, supra, was decided November 7, 1921. There had been a number of decisions holding General Orders 18 and 18-A invalid. \n3\n The record does not show whether the district court followed these decisions, or, as suggested in the opinion of the Supreme Court, based its ruling on a lack of evidence to support the motion. There was no issue as to the facts on which defendant's motion was based, and it could not reasonably be held that he was bound to bring forward evidence to establish statements consistent with the allegations of the petition, and which had not been questioned by plaintiff. Notwithstanding its reference to the matter, the Supreme Court, as we read its decision, did not hold that defendant's failure at the first trial to insist that the district court again rule on the objection to jurisdiction operated to deprive him of the right to do so at the second trial. \n\n[266 U.S. 314, 321]\n\u00a0\n The objection was well pleaded as a defense in accordance with the Nebraska practice. There is no reason why a defense pleaded, but not urged at an earlier trial, may not be insisted upon at a new trial. See Moulor v. American Life Ins. Co., \n111 \nU.S. 335, 337\n, 4 S. Ct. 466. The ruling that the former decision of the state court became the law of the case does not affect the power of this court to re-examine the question. Messinger v. Anderson, \n225 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 32 S. Ct. 739; Grays Harbor Co. v. Coats-Fordney, \n243 \nU.S. 251, 257\n, 37 S. Ct. 295; Georgia Ry. Co. v. Decatur, supra, 437 (43 S. Ct. 613).\n It must be held that defendant plainly asserted and reasonably insisted upon his immunity from suit on plaintiff's claim in the Nebraska court under section 10 of the Federal Control Act and the orders of the Director General. His objection to the jurisdiction should have been sustained. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Bulletin No. 4, United States Railroad Administration, p. 186 ( No. 18), p. 187 (No. 18-A), p. 334 (No. 50).

Miner, of Minneapolis, Minn., for McCaull-Dinsmore co.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The courts below affirmed judgment for the plaintiffs in four separate actions brought to recover alleged overcharges on freight said to have been demanded by the respective carriers in violation of the long and short haul clause (Fourth Section, Interstate Commerce Act, c. 104,  4, 24 Stat. 379, 380; 36 Stat. 539, 547, c. 309; 41 Stat. 456, 480, c. 91 [ Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8566]), which declares:\n'That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act to charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the transportation of passengers, or of like kind of property, for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line or route in the same direction, the shorter being included within the longer distance, or to charge any greater compensation \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 414]\n\u00a0\n as a through rate than the aggregate of the intermediate rates subject to the provisions of this act, but this shall not be construed as authorizing any common carrier within the terms of this act to charge or receive as great compensation for a shorter as for a longer distance: Provided, that upon application to the Commission such common carrier may in special cases, after investigation, be authorized by the Commission to charge less for longer than for shorter distances for the transportation of passengers or property; and the Commission may from time to time prescribe the extent to which such designated common carrier may be relieved from the operation of this section.'\n\n The Transportation Act 1920 added:\n'But in exercising the authority conferred upon it in this proviso the Commission shall not permit the establishment of any charge to or from the more distant point that is not reasonably compensatory for the service performed. ...'\n\n All the cases involve the same fundamental question of law. The essential charge is that the carrier demanded and received greater compensation for transporting freight for a shorter distance than its published rate for transporting like property for a longer distance over the same route and in the same direction.\n It will suffice to state the salient facts and issues disclosed by record No. 114-Davis, Agent, v. Portland Seed Company. They are typical.\n Pecos is in western Texas, 160 miles south of Roswell, N. M. A line of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway system joins these points and extends northward to Denver, Colo., where it connects with the Union Pacific system, which leads into the northwest. January 4, 1919, the carrier received a car of alfalfa seed at Roswell for transportation to Walla Walla, Wash., by way of Denver. Three weeks later respondent Portland Seed Company received this car at destination and paid \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 415]\n\u00a0\n freight charges reckoned at $2.44 per 100 pounds-the scheduled rate from Roswell. During all of January, 1919, the initial carrier's published schedule specified $1,515 per 100 pounds as the rate for transporting alfalfa seed from Pecos to Walla Walla, through Roswell and Denver, and no application had been made to the Interstate Commerce Commission for permission to charge less for the longer than for the shorter haul. The seed company demanded judgment for the excess above the Pecos rate, as an overcharge illegally exacted and recoverable as money had and received.\n The insistence is that under the long and short haul clause the lower published rate from Pecos became the maximum which the carrier could charge for the shipment from Roswell, notwithstanding the higher published rate therefor; that the sum charged above the Pecos rate amounted to an illegal exaction, recoverable without other proof of actual damage and without regard to the intrinsic reasonableness of either rate.\n Relying on Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. International Coal Co., \n230 U.S. 184\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 893, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 315, the Interstate Commerce Commission has definitely rejected respondent's theory by many opinions, and holds that while a charge prohibited by the long and short haul clause, section 4, may subject the carrier to prosecution by the government it does not afford adequate basis for reparation where there is no other proof of pecuniary damage. Nix & Co. v. Southern Ry. Co. (1914) 31 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 145; S. J. Greenbaum Co. v. Southern Ry. Co., 38 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 715; Chattanooga Implement & Mfg. Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 40 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 146; La Crosse Shippers' Ass'n v. C., I. & L. Ry. Co., 43 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 520; Oregon Fruit Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., 50 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 719; Iten Biscuit Co. v. C., B. & Q. R. Co., 53 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 729; Illinois Brick Co. v. Director General (1920) 57 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 320, 323.\n Counsel insist that under section 4 it was unlawful to charge compensation above the published Pecos rate for the \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 416]\n\u00a0\n transportation from Roswell to Walla Walla. Therefore, the published Roswell rate being unlawful, nonexistent indeed, the Pecos rate became the only one in force. United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n235 \nU.S. 314, 322\n, 323 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 113, is relied upon, and it is said that the opinion there interprets the long and short haul clause as 'absolutely prohibiting the existence' of higher rates for shorter hauls unless approved by the Commission. Read with the real issue in mind the opinion gives no support to respondent's argument. The Interstate Commerce Commission held that certain reshipping privileges granted to Nashville, but refused to Atlanta, amounted to unreasonable preference under section 3 (Comp. St.  8565), and ordered the carrier to discontinue them. The Commerce Court restrained the enforcement of this order. This court declared that the challenged privileges were prohibited by the long and short haul clause; that section 4 controlled the right to grant them; that they had not been authorized by the Commission, and therefore it would be unlawful to continue them. Accordingly the order to desist was approved and the decree of the Commerce Court reversed. No disagreement with Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. International Coal Co. was suggested. The court said:\n \n235 \nU.S. 322, 323\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 115: 'The express or implied statutory recognition of the authority on the part of carriers to primarily determine for themselves the existence of substantially similar circumstances and conditions as a basis of charging a higher rate for a shorter than for a longer distance within the purview of section 4 of the Act to Regulate Commerce and the right to make a rate accordingly to continue in force until on complaint it was corrected in the manner pointed out by statute, ceased to exist after the adoption of the amendment to section 4 by the Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 547. This results from the fact that by the amendment in question the original power to determine \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 417]\n\u00a0\n the existence of the conditions justifying the greater charge for a shorter than was exacted for a longer distance, was taken from the carriers and primarily vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission, and for the purpose of making the prohibition efficacious it was enacted that after a time fixed no existing rate of the character provided for should continue in force unless the application to sanction it had been made and granted. Intermountain Rate Cases, \n234 U.S. 476\n. If then it be that the rebilling privilege which is here in question, disregarding immaterial considerations of form and looking at the substance of things, was, when originally established, an exertion of the authority conferred or recognized by section 4 of the act, as there is no pretense that permission for its continuance had been applied for as required by the amendment and the statutory period for which it could be lawfully continued without such permission had expired, it follows that its continued operation was manifestly unlawful and error was committed in permitting its continuance under the shelter of the injunction awarded by the court below.'\n The opinion does not discuss the carrier's liability to shippers who had paid higher rates for the shorter hauls. No doubt similar relief would have been granted by the Commission, if the situation here revealed had been brought before it.\n Respondent has not asked an injunction against illegal rates. It seeks to secure something for itself without proof of pecuniary loss consequent upon the unlawful act. A similar effort failed in Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. International Coal Co., supra. The International Company shipped 40,000 tons of coal from the Clearfield district, paying full schedule rates. The carrier had allowed other shippers from and to the same places at the same time rebates ranging from 5 to 35 cents per ton. Without alleging or proving pecuniary injury resulting \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 418]\n\u00a0\n to itself from this unlawful action, the company sought to recover like concessions upon all its shipments. Through Mr. Justice Lamar, this court said:\n \n230 \nU.S. 196, 197\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 893, 896:\n'The published tariffs made no distinction between contract coal and free coal, but named one rate for all alike. That being true, only that single rate could be charged. When collected, it was unlawful, under any pretense or for any cause, however equitable or liberal, to pay a part back to one shipper or to every shipper. The statute required the carrier to abide absolutely by the tariff. It did not permit the company to decide that it had charged too much and then make a corresponding rebate; nor could it claim that it had charged too little and insist upon a larger sum being paid by the shipper . ... The tariff, so long as it was of force, was, in this respect, to be treated as though it had been a statute, binding as such upon railroad and shipper alike. If, as a fact, the rates were unreasonable the shipper was nevertheless bound to pay and the carrier to retain what had been paid, leaving, however, to the former the right to apply to the Commission for reparation.'\n\n \n230 U.S. 200\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 897: 'Though the act has been held to be in many respects highly penal, yet there was no fixed measure of damage in favor of the plaintiff. But, as said in Parsons v. Chicago & N. W. Railway, \n167 U.S. 447\n, 460, construing this section (8): 'Before any party can recover under the act he must show not merely the wrong of the carrier, but that that wrong has in fact operated to his injury.' Congress had not then and has not since given any indication of an intent that persons not injured might, nevertheless, recover what though called damages would really be a penalty, in addition to the penalty payable to the government. On the contrary, and in answer to the argument that damages might be a cover for rebates, the Act of June 18, 1910 (36 Stat. 539, c. 309), \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 419]\n\u00a0\n provided that where a carrier misquotes a rate it should pay a penalty of $250, not to the shipper, but to the government, recoverable by a civil action brought by the United States. 35 Stat. 166; Congressional Record 1910, 7569. The danger that payment of damages for violations of the law might be used as a means of paying rebates under the name of damages is also pointed out by the Commission in 12 I. C. C. 418-421, 423, and 14 I. C. C. 82.'\n \n230 U.S. 200\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 897: 'It is said, however, that it is impossible to prove the damages occasioned one shipper by the payment of rebates to another, and that if the plaintiff is not entitled to recover as damages the same drawback that was paid to its competitor, the statute not only gives no remedy, but deprives the plaintiff of a right it had at common law to recover this difference between the lawful and the unlawful rate.'\n \n230 \nU.S. 200, 201\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 897: 'We are cited to no authority which shows that there was any such ancient measure of damages, and no case has been found in which damages were awarded for such discrimination. Indeed, it is exceedingly doubtful whether there was at common law any right of action for any sort of damages in a case like this, while, this statute does give a clear, definite and positive right to recover for unjust discrimination.'\n \n230 \nU.S. 201, 202\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 898: 'Union Pacific R. R. v. Goodridge, \n149 U.S. 680\n, 709, involved the construction of the Colorado statute, which did not, as does the Commerce Act, compel the carrier to adhere to published rates, but required the railroad to make the same concessions and drawbacks to all persons alike, and for a failure to do so made the carrier liable for three times the actual damage sustained or overcharges paid by the party aggrieved. This distinction is also to be noted in the English cases cited. The act of Parliament did not require the carrier to maintain its published tariff but made the lowest rate the lawful rate. \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 420]\n\u00a0\n Anything in excess of such lowest rate was extortion and might be recovered in an action at law as for an overcharge. Denaby v. Manchester Ry., L. R. 11 App. Cases, 97, 116. But the English courts make a clear distinction between overcharge and damages, and the same is true under the Commerce Act. For if the plaintiff here had been required to pay more than the tariff rate it could have recovered the excess, not as damages, but as overcharge, and while one count of the complaint asserted a claim of this nature, the proof did not justify a verdict thereon, for the plaintiff admitted that it had only paid the lawful rates named in the tariff. Of course, no part of such payment of lawful rates can be treated as an overcharge or as an extortion.'\n \n230 \nU.S. 202, 203\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 898: 'Having paid only the lawful rate plaintiff was not overcharged, though the favored shipper was illegally undercharged. For that violation of law, the carrier was subject to the payment of a fine to the government and, in addition, was liable for all damages it thereby occasioned the plaintiff or any other shipper. But, under section 8, it was only liable for damages. Making an illegal undercharge to one shipper did not license the carrier to make a similar undercharge to other shippers, and if having paid a rebate of 25 cents a ton to one customer, the carrier in order to escape this suit had made a similar undercharge or rebate to the plaintiff, it would have been criminally liable, even though it may have been done in order to equalize the two companies. For, under the statute, it was not liable to the plaintiff for the amount of the rebate paid on contract coal, but only for the damages such illegal payment caused the plaintiff. The measure of damages was the pecuniary loss inflicted on the plaintiff as the result of the rebate paid. Those damages might be the same as the rebate, or less than the rebate, or many times greater than the rebate; but unless they were proved they could not be recovered. \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 421]\n\u00a0\n Whatever they were they could be recovered, because section 8 expressly declares that wherever the carrier did an act prohibited of failed to do any act required, it should be 'liable to the person injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of such violation ... together with reasonable attorney's fee.\"\n \n230 U.S. 206\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 900: 'To adopt such a rule and arbitrarily measure damages by rebates would create a legalized, but endless, chain of departures from the tariff, would extend the effect of the original crime, would destroy the equality and certainty of rates, and, contrary to the statute, would make the carrier liable for damages beyond those inflicted and to persons not injured. The limitation of liability to the persons damaged and to an amount equal to the injury suffered is not out of consideration for the carrier who has violated the statute. On the contrary, the act imposes heavy penalties, independent of the amount of rebate paid, and as each shipment constitutes a separate offense, the law in its measure of fine and punishment is a terror to evil-doers. But for the public wrong and for the interference with the equal current of commerce these penalties or fines were made payable to the government. If by the same act a private injury was inflicted a private right of action was given. But the public wrong did not necessarily cause private damage, and when it did, the pecuniary loss varied with the character of the property, the circumstances of the shipment and the state of the market, so that instead of giving the shipper the right to recover a penalty fixed in amount or measure, the statute made the guilty carrier liable for the full amount of damages sustained- whatever they might be and whether greater or less than the rate of rebate paid.'\n Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Co., \n245 U.S. 531\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 186, presents no conflict with Pennsylvania R. R. v. International Coal Co. There the shipper paid a published rate which the Commission afterwards found to be unreasonable. \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 422]\n\u00a0\n This court held he could recover, as the proximate damage of the unlawful demand, the excess above the rate which the Commission had declared to be reasonable. The opinion went no further. Certainly it did not suggest that the unreasonable rate was nonexistent for any purpose because forbidden by law.\n Section 6 of the Commerce Act directs:\n'(1) That every common carrier subject to the provisions of this act shall file with the Commission created by this act and print and keep open to public inspection schedules showing all the rates, fares, and charges for transportation between different points on its own route and between points on its own route and points on the route of any other carrier by railroad, by pipe line, or by water when a through route and joint rate have been established. ... (3) No change shall be made in the rates, fares, and charges or joint rates, fares, and charges which have been filed and published by any common carrier in compliance with the requirements of this section, except after thirty days' notice to the Commission: ... Provided, that the Commission may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, allow changes upon less than the notice herein specified. ... (7) No carrier, unless otherwise provided by this act, shall engage or participate in the transportation of passengers or property, as defined in this act, unless the rates, fares, and charges upon which the same are transported by said carrier have been filed and published in accordance with the provisions of this act; nor shall any carrier charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for such transportation of passengers or property, or for any service in connection therewith, between the points named in such tariffs than the rates, fares, and charges which are specified in the tariff filed and in effect at the time; nor shall any carrier refund or remit in any manner or by any device any portion \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 423]\n\u00a0\n of the rates, fares, and charges so specified, nor extend to any shipper or person any privileges or facilities in the transportation of passengers or property, except such as are specified in such tariffs.' Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8569\n\n\n\n'Sec. 8. That in case any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act shall do, cause to be done, or permit to be done any act, matter, or thing in this act prohibited or declared to be unlawful, or shall omit to do any act, matter, or thing in this act required to be done, such common carrier shall be liable to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation of the provisions of this act, together with a reasonable counsel or attorney's fee, to be fixed by the court in every case of recovery, which attorney's fee shall be taxed and collected as part of the costs in the case.' Comp. St.  8572.\n\n'Sec. 10 (1). That any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act, or, whenever such common carrier is a corporation, any director or officer thereof, or any receiver, trustee, lessee, agent, or person acting for or employed by such corporation, who, alone or with any other corporation, company, person, or party, shall willfully do or cause to be done, or shall willingly suffer or permit to be done, any act, matter, or thing in this act prohibited or declared to be unlawful, or who shall aid or abet therein, or shall willfully omit or fail to do any act, matter, or thing in this act required to be done, or shall cause or willingly suffer or permit any act, matter, or thing so directed or required by this act to be done or not to be so done, or shall aid or abet any such omission or failure, or shall be guilty of any infraction of this act for which no penalty is otherwise provided, or who shall aid or abet therein, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof in any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such offense was committed, be subject to a fine of not to \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 424]\n\u00a0\n exceed five thousand dollars for each offense: Provided, that if the offense for which any person shall be convicted as aforesaid shall be an unlawful discrimination in rates, fares, or charges for the transportation of passengers or property, ... such person shall, in addition to the fine hereinbefore provided for, be liable to imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of not exceeding two years, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.' Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8574.\n\n What liability did the carrier incur by publishing a rate from Pecos lower than the scheduled one from Roswell without the Commission's permission, and thereafter imposing and collecting the higher rate upon the shipment to Walla Walla?\n Construing the words of section 4 literally, it is argued that unless some property moved over the longer distance at the lower rate before greater compensation was charged for transporting like property over a shorter one, there was no violation of law. We cannot accept this view. It does not accord proper weight to imperative requirements concerning publication of rates and subsequent observance of them. The Commission holds, for example, that although the schedule contains a plain clerical error, nevertheless no other charge may be demanded and the shipper may recover any excess. Lamb-Fish Lumber Co. v. Y. & M. V. R. R. Co., 42 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 470.\n The record shows, we think, that the carrier violated the statute by publishing the lower rate for the longer haul without permission and, prima facie at least, incurred the penalties of section 10. Also it became 'liable to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of ... such violation,' together with reasonable counsel fees, as provided by section 8. But mere publication of the forbidden lower rate did not wholly efface the higher intermediate one from the schedule and substitute for all purposes the \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 425]\n\u00a0\n lower one, as a supplement might have done, without regard to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of either.\n With special knowledge of rate schedules and relying on Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. International Coal Company, the Interstate Commerce Commission for 10 years has required proof of financial loss as a prerequisite to reparation for infractions of the fourth section. The rule is firmly established. Congress has not shown disapproval. The Transportation Act of 1920 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 et seq .), with evident purpose to conserve the carriers' revenues, added the following to the proviso which gives power to exempt from the long and short haul clause:\n'But in exercising the authority conferred upon it in this proviso the Commission shall not permit the establishment of any charge to or from the more distant point that is not reasonably compensatory for the service performed.'\n\n The rule adopted by the Commission follows the logic of the opinion relied upon and can be readily applied. The contrary view would not harmonize with other provisions of the act, and, put into practice, would produce unfortunate consequences.\n The statute requires rigid observance of the tariff, without regard to the inherent lawfulness of the rates specified. It commanded adherence to the published rate from Roswell; section 6 forbade any other charge. Observance of the lower rate from Pecos, put in without authorization, might have been forbidden, as pointed out in United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., supra; but it would be going too far to hold, as respondent insists, that the unauthorized publication established the lower rate as the maximum permissible charge from the intermediate point- the only rate therefrom which could be demanded.\n If a lower rate published without authority becomes the maximum which may be charged from any intermediate \n\n[264 U.S. 403, 426]\n\u00a0\n point, mistakes in schedules (and they are inevitable) may become disastrous. Suppose the rate from an obscure point in Maine to San Franciso via Boston, New York, and Chicago should be printed at $15.00, instead of $150, and the error remain undiscovered for many months, could all who had paid more than $15.00 for passage along that route recover the excess without proof of pecuniary loss?\n After the challenged judgments were entered, Kansas City Southern Ry. v. Wolf, \n261 U.S. 133\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 259, was decided. We adhere to the ruling there announced, and in view of it defenses in these causes based upon prescribed limitations must be determined.\n The judgments below are reversed. The causes will be remanded, with appropriate instructions for further proceedings.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissents. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDELANEY v. U.

The defendants in No. 348 were Thomas A. Delaney, Joseph Ray, Joseph Dudenhoefer, Sr., Joseph Dudenhoefer, Jr., Joseph Dudenhoefer Company, a corporation, and Joseph Giudice. The defendants in No. 350 were the same parties as above, with the addition of Walter M. Burke.\n The Dudenhoefers pleaded guilty, Giudice died, and Burke was not tried. Delaney, petitioner, and Ray, were alone proceeded against, the indictments being consolidated for the purpose of trial, and resulted in a verdict of guilty, upon which there was a judgment of imprisonment in the penitentiary for two years and a fine of $10,000 imposed.\n Both defendants joined in a writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals, composed of Judges Baker, Evans, and Page. The court affirmed the judgment without opinion.\n A petition for rehearing was made by petitioner (Ray not joining), based on the ground that he was convicted upon inadmissible and uncorroborated hearsay testimony, the insufficiency of the evidence otherwise to establish his guilt, and that he was deprived of a fair trial by the attitude of the trial judge. The petition was denied.\n Thereupon a petition was filed to vacate the orders theretofore entered and to set the case for reargument. \n\n[263 U.S. 586, 588]\n\u00a0\n The petition recited the fact of the indictments and the proceedings and conviction upon them, and that certain other indictments were filed, charging one Arthur Birk and others with violation of the Prohibition Act, and that Birk made a motion to quash the indictment, which motion was heard, considered, and denied by Evan A. Evans, one of the judges of the District Court. It was further represented that a motion was made by Walter M. Burke, a codefendant with petitioner, to quash the indictment against him (Burke), which was also heard by Judge Evans and denied by him.\n It was further represented that Birk was placed on trial before Judge Evans, found guilty, and sentenced to confinement in a penitentiary and to pay a fine, and that after the proceedings thus detailed, including those against petitioner, Judge Evans sat with the other judges who had presided at the trial of petitioner, and took part in their deliberations respecting the penalties to be inflicted upon petitioner and his codefendants. That Judge Evans was also one of the Judges in the imposition of penalties upon the various defendants.\n It was represented that by reason of the participation of Judge Evans as thus detailed, he became and was disqualified to sit in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that the order of that court purporting to affirm the judgment of the District Court was entered without jurisdiction and was void, and that a rehearing and reconsideration of the case should have been ordered.\n In support of the motion, section 120 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St .  1112) was cited. Its provision is as follows:\n'That no judge before whom a cause or question may have been tried or heard in a district court, or existing Circuit Court, shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in the Circuit Court of Appeals.'\n\n The section seems not to have attracted the attention or appreciation of petitioner until he had experimented with \n\n[263 U.S. 586, 589]\n\u00a0\n other means of review and relief from the conviction adjudged against him. It may be that he did not thereby waive the section which may express a policy and solicitude in the law to keep its tribunals free from bias or prejudgment, rather than to afford a remedy to a litigant, yet it would seem that he should not be permitted to assume the competency of the tribunal to decide for him and its incompetency to decide against him. His action certainly suggests the idea that it was an afterthought with him that he was at any time in the situation from which the section was intended to relieve. And was he? It will be observed that the section precludes a judge or justice before whom a 'Cause or question may have been tried or heard' to 'sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in the Circuit Court oa Appeals.' These words have received exposition in Rexford v. Brunswick-Balke Co., \n228 \nU.S. 339, 343\n, 344 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 515, 517 (57 L. Ed. 864). It is there said:\n'Its manifest purpose is to require that the Circuit Court of Appeals be composed in every hearing of judges none of whom will be in the attitude of passing upon the propriety, scope or effect of any ruling of his own made in the progress of the cause in the court of first instance, ... which it is the duty of the Circuit Court of Appeals to consider and pass upon.'\n\n In this case there was no question before the Circuit Court of Appeals that had been considered by Judge Evans in the District Court.\n The charge that Judge Evans sat with the other judges and considered with them the penalties to be imposed on the codefendants of petitioner, we do not think has justification in the record. Besides counsel at the oral argument said he was not disposed to press it.\n Petitioner attacks the judgment as not being supported by the testimony, a great deal of which is detailed. The immediate reply is that the probative sufficiency of the testimony has the support of the District Court (in which is included the verdict of the jury) and of the Circuit \n\n[263 U.S. 586, 590]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals. It would take something more than ingenious criticism to bring even into question that concurrence or to detract from its assuring strength-something more than this record presents.\n It is contended that hearsay evidence was received against petitioner, and this is erected into a charge of the deprivation of his constitutional rights to be confronted with the witnesses against him. Hearsay evidence can have that effect and its admission against objection constitutes error. Diaz v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 442, 450\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 250, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1138; Rowland v. Boyle, \n244 \nU.S. 106, 108\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 577; Spiller v. Atchison, etc., Ry. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117, 130\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 466. And error is asserted and in support of the assertion there is general declamation and faultfinding with the case in its entirety. The only exception, however, was of testimony given by one of the conspirators of what another one of the conspirators (the latter being dead) had told him, during the progress of the conspiracy. We think the testimony was competent and within the ruling of the cases. American Fur Co. v. United States, 2 Pet. 358; Nudd v. Burrows, \n91 U.S. 426\n, 438; Wiborg v. United States, \n163 U.S. 632\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 1127, 1197. And it has been said that the extent to which evidence of that kind is admissible is much in the discretion of the trial judge. Wiborg v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 632, 658\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 1127, 1197. We do not think that the discretion was abused in the present case.\n There is nothing in the record which justifies a reversal of the case, and the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDILLINGHAM v. MCLAUGHLIN(1924)\nNo. 690\nArgued: March 17, 1924Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 370, 371]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. O. D. Burden, of Syracuse, N. Y., and Terry A. Lyon, of Washington, D. C., for appellants and cross-appellees.\n Mr. Edward G. Griffin, of Albany, N. Y., for appellees and cross- appellants.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiffs in this case are the president, vice-president and secretary and treasurer, who are also trustees, of the Mutual Benefit League of North America, described in the bill as a common law trust and sometimes denominated plaintiff. The defendants are the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York, the Attorney General and the District Attorneys of the same State. The suit is a proceeding in equity brought to prevent the enforcement of an act of the state Legislature approved June 1, 1923, Laws of 1923, c. 895, which makes the continuance of the plaintiffs' business a misdemeanor. The ground of the bill is that the statute impairs the obligation of contracts, deprives the plaintiffs and those whom they represent of their liberty and property without due process of law, and denies them the equal protection of the law, contrary to section 10, art. 1, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The case was heard by three judges under section 266 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1243), and an interlocutory injunction was issued against prosecuting 'this plaintiff' and enforcing the law as to contracts actually entered into on or before June 25, 1923, \n\n[264 U.S. 370, 372]\n\u00a0\n THE DATE OF THE HEARING, BUT EXCEPT TO THat extent was denied. both parties appeal.\n The statute forbids any individual partnership or unincorporated association to engage in the business of receiving deposits or payments of money in installments, for co-operative, mutual loan, savings or investment purposes in sums of less than $500 each; or to conduct a business similar to the business of a savings bank or a savings and loan association or to promise to make loans upon real estate security for building, etc., purposes as an inducement for the payment of such sums. There are amplifications to stop rat holes but they need not be stated as it is not denied that the plaintiffs are within the act. The plaintiffs' business consists in soliciting and receiving payments under a complicated document which it is unlikely that the applicant will understand. It is called a 3 per cent. loan contract and bears the large letters 'Face Value $--.' The so-called face value is the amount ultimately to be paid by the applicant, and is $100 or more. One per cent. of the amount is to be paid by the applicant monthly. The contracts are placed in a series which is closed at $140,000. The first 4 1\/2 payments are applied by the plaintiffs to the expenses of the business. The subsequent receipts go into a fund appropriated to the series, as do also interest on loans and lapses within the series. When that fund is equal to the face value of a contract the first applicant in the order in time, if he has paid 10 per cent., may borrow the face value of his contract at 3 per cent. on an approved first mortgage of real estate, repaying at least $7 per thousand every month, or he may permit the plaintiffs to sell his right, and receive the amount that he has paid in, with a problematical bonus that need not be described. If he prefers to keep on and pay the full face value the plaintiffs 30 months later will repay it without interest but with a share in \n\n[264 U.S. 370, 373]\n\u00a0\n a surplus, if any, that we need not explain. Failure to pay five installments forfeits the contract, but after six payments the applicant may get a certificate for a considerably less sum than he has paid, increasing however with the increase in the number of the payments, and payable in 100 months or less at the option of the trustees. Further particulars are superfluous but it is obvious that the position and rights of the applicant are very largely dependent upon chance so so far as he is concerned. It is true that his position in the series is certain, but it is extremely improbable that he is told what it will be, as a man would not be likely to come into a series if he knew that a large number of people were entitled ahead of him to whatever advantages the scheme offered. What a man does not know and cannot find out is chance as to him, and is recognized as chance by the law. Otherwise insurance lost or not lost would not be a valid contract.\n That however is not the question here. The statute in controversy is not aimed at gaming of any sort but is a regulation of a business so far akin to banking as to be at least equally clothed with a public interest, and subject to regulation. A state may confine banking to corporations. Shallenberger v. First State Bank of Holstein, \n219 U.S. 114\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 189. We see no reason why it may not confine the plaintiffs' business in the same way. It is argued that the business is prohibited altogether, because the statute makes 'any person' violating it a criminal. It is said truly enough that a corporation is a person in the sense of the New York laws. But a corporation could not violate this law because its commands are addressed only to individuals, partnerships and unincorporated associations. So far as this section is concerned it does not prevent the plaintiffs from going on with their business if they will subject themselves to the supervision incident to the corporate form. \n\n[264 U.S. 370, 374]\n\u00a0\n The distinction between the businesses of receiving small deposits and those above $500 is legitimate. The small sums generally come from people without much knowledge of such affairs. Whatever may be one's own opinion about the wisdom of trying to save the ignorant and rash from folly it is a recognized power that is used in many ways. We have adverted to the element of chance in this very undertaking because it is one not likely to be realized by an applicant. This and the long delay and loss that may ensue upon any particular deposit would be sufficient warrant for the State's effort at least to bring such business under supervision and control, if not to prevent it altogether. It is said that the statute as drawn extends to cases with which it would be irrational to interfere. The judges below were careful to exclude such a construction, but at all events it is no concern of the plaintiffs. The statute so far as it applies to them must be upheld. Engel v. O'Malley, \n219 U.S. 128\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 190.\n We do not agree with the Court below as to present contracts. The operation of reasonable laws for the protection of the public cannot be headed off by making contracts reaching into the future. Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 480\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 127; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 482\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 265, 34 L. R. A. (n. S.) 671; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 558\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 364; Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co. v. Denver, \n250 \nU.S. 241, 244\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 450. We are of opinion that the injunction should have been denied altogether. If there are objections to the law under the State Constitution that we do not perceive they will be open to the present plaintiffs when proceedings are instituted in the State Courts.\n Decree reversed.\n Preliminary injunction denied. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDORCHY v. STATE OF KANSAS(1924)\nNo. 163\nArgued: Decided: March 10, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 286, 287]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Redmond S. Brennan, of Kansas City, Mo., John F. McCarron, of Washington, D. C., Frank Bonar Hegarty, of Kansas City, Mo., and Phil. H. Callery, of Pittsburg, Kan., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John G. Egan, of Topeka, Kan., Chester I. Long, of Wichita, Kan., and Richard J. Hopkins, of Topeka, Kan., for the State of Kansas.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Court of Industrial Relations Act was approved January 23, 1920. Laws of Kansas, 1920, Special Session, \n\n[264 U.S. 286, 288]\n\u00a0\n c. 29. The purpose of the statute is to insure continuity of operation in coal mining and other businesses declared to be affected with a public interest. \n1\n The means provided for accomplishing this is a system of compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes. The instrument is the so- called industrial court. Upon it is conferred power to investigate all matters involved in such controversies; to make findings thereon; to issue such orders as it may deem needful, fixing the wages to be paid, the hours of work, the rules for work, and the working and living conditions. The provisions in aid of the enforcement of this system are both comprehensive and detailed. The employer is prohibited, among other things, from limiting or ceasing operations with a view to defeating the purpose of the statute. Likewise, every association of persons (e. g., trade unions) is prohibited from acting to that end. In effect, strikes and lockouts, the boycott and picketing, are made unlawful. Any person violating any provision of the statute, or any order of the so-called court, is declared guilty of a misdemeanor. Some of the provisions of the act were considered in Howat v. Kansas, \n258 U.S. 181\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 277, and in Charles Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, \n262 U.S. 522\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 630\n\n\n Section 19 provides that any officer of a union of workmen engaged in an industry within the provisions of the act, who shall willfully use the power incident to his official position to influence any other person to violate any provision of the statute or any valid order of the Court of \n\n[264 U.S. 286, 289]\n\u00a0\n Industrial Relations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony punishable by a fine not to exceed $5,000, or by imprisonment at hard labor, not to exceed two years, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Under this section an information was filed against Dorchy, a union official, for calling a strike in a coal mine. He was found guilty. The judgment entered was affirmed by the highest court of the state, 112 Kan. 235, 210 Pac. 352; and a rehearing was denied. The case is here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1214). It is contended that section 19 is void, because it prohibits strikes; and that to do so is a denial of the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n After the judgment under review was entered in the Supreme Court of Kansas, this Court declared, in the Wolff Packing Co. Case, supra, p. 544, that the system of compulsory arbitration as applied to packing plants violates the federal Constitution. For the reasons there set forth, it is unconstitutional, also, as applied to the coal mines of that state. The question suggests itself whether section 19 has not, therefore, necessarily fallen as a part of the system of compulsory arbitration. If so, there is no occasion to consider the specific objection to the provisions of that section. This Court has power not only to correct errors in the judgment entered below, but, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, to make such disposition of the case as justice may now require. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503, 506\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 542. In determining what justice requires the Court must consider changes in law and in fact which have supervened since the judgment was entered below. Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca di Navigazione, \n248 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 1, 3 A. L. R. 323. If section 19 falls as the result of the decision in the Wolff Packing Co. Case, the effect is the same as if the section had been repealed without any reservation.\n A statute bad in part is not necessarily void in its entirety. Provisions within the legislative power may stand \n\n[264 U.S. 286, 290]\n\u00a0\n if separable from the bad. Berea College v. Kentucky, \n211 U.S. 45\n, 54-56, 29 Sup. Ct. 33; Carey v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 118, 121\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 403. But a provision, inherently unobjectionable, cannot be deemed separable unless it appears both that, standing alone, legal effect can be given to it and that the legislature intended the provision to stand, in case others included in the act and held bad should fall. Section 19 does not, in terms, prohibit the calling of strikes or influencing workingmen to strike. It merely declares that one who uses his offcial position, or his position as an employer, to 'influence, impel, or compel any other person to violate any of the provisions of this act, or any valid order of said Court of Industrial Relations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony.' Most of the provisions of the original act are very intimately connected with the system of compulsory arbitration. Whether section 19 is so interwoven with the system held invalid that the section cannot stand alone, is a question of interpretation and of legislative intent. Compare Butts v. Merchants Transportation Co., \n230 U.S. 126\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 964. Section 28 of the act,2 (which resembles that discussed in Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 70\n, 71 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 453) provides a rule of construction which may sometimes aid in determining that intent. But it is an aid merely; not an inexorable command.\n The task of determining the intention of the state legislature in this respect, like the usual function of interpreting a state statute, rests primarily upon the state court. Its decision as to the severability of a provision is conclusive upon this Court. Gatewood v. North Carolina, \n203 \nU.S. 531, 543\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 167; Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347, 366\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 926, L. R. A. 1916A, 1124; \n\n[264 U.S. 286, 291]\n\u00a0\n Schneider Granite Co. v. Gast Realty Co., \n245 \nU.S. 288, 290\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 125. In cases coming from the lower federal courts, such questions of severability, if there is no controlling state decision, must be determined by this Court. Compare Myers v. Anderson, \n238 \nU.S. 368, 381\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 932; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 311\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 48. In cases coming from the state courts, this Court, in the absence of a controlling state decision, may, in passing upon the claim under the federal law, decide, also, the question of severability. But it is not obliged to do so. The situation may be such as to make it appropriate to leave the determination of the question to the state court. We think that course should be followed in this case.\n The Supreme Court of Kansas has already dealt, to some extent, with the effect of our decision upon other sections of the act. When a motion was made there in the Wolff Packing Co. Case to spread the mandate of this Court upon its record, the state court held that the order of the Court of Industrial Relations under review remains in force in so far as it regulates hours of labor and weekly rest periods. 114 Kan. 304, 219 Pac. 259. The judgment then entered was modified November 10, 1923, upon a rehearing. \n3\n The relation of section 19 to the provisions held invalid is a different matter. So far as appears, the state court has not passed upon the question whether section 19, being an intimate part of the system of compulsory arbitration held to be invalid, falls with it. In order that the state court may pass upon this question, its judgment in this case, which was rendered before our decision in the Wolff Packing Co. Case, should be vacated. Compare Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. v. Dennis, supra, p. 509 (32 Sup. Ct. 542). To this end the judgment is\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2 of the statute, as enacted, conferred upon the Court of Industrial Relations the functions theretofore performed by the Public Utilities Commission. These functions were restored to a Public Utilities Commission by chapter 260, Laws of 1921. There was conferred upon the Court of Industrial Relations by chapter 262 of the Laws of 1921 the functions theretofore performed by the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, and by chapter 263 of the Laws of 1921 the functions theretofore performed by the Industrial Welfare Commission. These latter powers were also enlarged. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 28: 'If any section or provision of this act shall be found invalid by any court, it shall be conclusively presumed that this act would have been passed by the legislature without such invalid section or provision, and the act as a whole shall not be declared invalid by reason of the fact that one or more sections or provisions may be found to be invalid by any court.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The action of the state court has been brought here for review by proceedings entered February 16, 1924, and not yet disposed of. \n\n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nE I DUPONT DE NEMOURS & CO. v.

C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 456, 459]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action to recover demurrage charges accrued at Little Rock, Ark., during May, June, and July, 1918, on certain shipments of cotton linters. The defendant, petitioner here, demurred to the complaint on the grounds: (a) That the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitation; and (b) that plaintiff was without authority to bring the action. The District Court sustained the demurrer, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals. 287 Fed. 522.\n There is nothing in the second point, and we dispose of it at once. The contention is that the authority to maintain the action is vested in the Director General of Railroads, originally designated under the Federal Control Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a-3115 3\/4 p), and continued by the President under sections 202 and 211 of Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 459, 469 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 b, 10071 1\/4 e), and not in Davis, as Agent, appointed under section 206 of the latter act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 cc). Apt allegations, however, are found in the body of the complaint to bring the plaintiff, Davis, within the provisions of sections 202 and 211. At most, the words 'as agent' are surplusage, and it is impossible that defendant could have been prejudiced by their use. Act Feb. 26, 1919, c. 48, 40 Stat. 1181 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  1246).\n The action was brought more than three years after the cause of action accrued. The statute relied upon as a bar is section 424, Transportation Act 1920, 41 Stat. 491, 492 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8584), being a new paragraph added to section 16 of the Interstate Commerce Act by way of amendment. The pertinent words are:\n'(3) All actions at law by carriers subject to this act for recovery of their charges, or any part thereof, shall be begun within three years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after.'\n\n It is insisted that the United States-or the Director General, representing the United States-is included in the provision as a carrier \n\n[264 U.S. 456, 460]\n\u00a0\n subject to the act. Our opinion is otherwise. The act consists of five titles. Title 2 is devoted exclusively to the subject of the termination of federal control, which it is declared shall take place at 12:01 a. m., March 1, 1920-the act becoming effective February 28, 1920. Title 3 deals only with the subject of disputes between carriers and their employees and subordinate officials, creates Railroad Boards of Labor Adjustment and a Railroad Labor Board, and vests them with appropriate powers. Title 4 consists entirely of amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act, and includes section 424, here relied upon. While these three titles are concerned with related subjects, they are entirely distinct one from another Title 2, which is complete in itself, among other things, provides, in section 200 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 aa), that after the termination of federal control the President shall have no power to use or operate the railroads or systems of transportation, or to control or supervise the carriers or their business affairs; and directs him (section 202), to adjust, settle, liquidate, and wind up all matters and all questions and disputes, of whatsoever nature, arising out of or incident to federal control as soon as practicable after the termination thereof. The only provision prescribing a period of limitation definitely in respect of such matters, is found in section 206(a), and it relates only to actions, suits and proceedings brought against an agent to be designated by the President for that purpose, and fixes as the period of limitation that now prescribed by state or federal statutes, but not later than two years from the passage of the act. In this title, thus specifically devoted to the subject of winding up matters arising out of federal control, nothing is to be found which suggests any limitation of time within which actions, suits or proceedings shall be brought to enforce liabilities arising out of federal control, in favor of the United States.\n Turning now to title 4, amending the Interstate Commerce Act, the declaration at the beginning is that its \n\n[264 U.S. 456, 461]\n\u00a0\n provisions 'shall apply to common carriers' engaged in various enumerated kinds of transportation. Section 400, p. 474 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563). There is to be found in this title no provision specifically relating to the period of federal control or dealing with the question of liability to or of the government in respect of any matter arising during such control. If Congress had intended to fix a period of limitation applicable to actions, suits or proceedings brought in behalf of the United States in respect of liabilities arising out of federal control, we should naturally expect to find it in title 2, where such matters are exclusively dealt with; and not in title 4, which deals with common carriers entirely apart from such control. It may not have been unusual in common speech, to describe the Director General as a carrier while he was operating the railroads; but it is clear that he was not intended to be included by that term as it is generally employed in acts of Congress. Federal Control Act, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451, repeatedly recognizes a distinction between the President-including, of course, the Director General-and the carriers. The first section (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a) itself limits the meaning of the word 'carriers' to railroads and systems of transportation, which as carriers had been taken over by the President. Accurately speaking, the Director General was not a carrier, but an operator of carriers. The distinction to which we have referred, constantly appears in the provisions of the act, as, for example:\n'The President may nevertheless pay to any carrier while under federal control an annual amount,' etc. Section 2 (section 3115 3\/4 b).\n\n'On the application of the President or of any carrier,' etc. Section 3 (section 3115 3\/4 c).\n\n'Carriers while under federal control shall be subject to all laws and liabilities as common carriers,' etc. Section 10 (section 3115 3\/4 j).\n\n'Actions at law or suits in equity may be brought by and against said carriers,' etc. Section 10.\n\n'Moneys and other property derived from the operation of the carriers during federal control are hereby declared to be the property of the United States.' Section 12 (section 3115 3\/4 l). \n\n[264 U.S. 456, 462]\n\u00a0\n In taking over and operating the railroad systems of the country, the United States did so in its sovereign capacity, as a war measure, 'under a right in the nature of eminent domain,' North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Lee, \n260 U.S. 16\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 2; Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, \n256 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 593; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n250 U.S. 135\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 502; In re Tidewater Coal Exchange (C. C. A.) 280 Fed. 648, 649; and it may not be held to have waived any sovereign right or privilege unless plainly so provided. Moneys and other property derived from the operation of the carriers during federal control, as we have seen, are the property of the United States. Section 12, 40 Stat. 457. An action by the Director General to recover upon a liability arising out of such control is an action on behalf of the United States in its governmental capacity, Ches. & Del. Canal Co. v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 123, 126\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 407; In re Tidewater Coal Exchange, supra; and, therefore, is subject to no time limitation, in the absence of congressional enactment clearly imposing it. United States v. Nashville, etc., Ry. Co., \n118 \nU.S. 120, 125\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 1006; United States v. Whited & Wheless, \n246 \nU.S. 552, 561\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 367. Statutes of limitation sought to be applied to bar rights of the government, must receive a strict construction in favor of the government. United States v. Whited & Wheless, supra.\n\n The foregoing analysis of the acts of Congress viewed in the light of the principles just stated, demonstrates that section 424 has no application to an action of the kind here involved, but applies to common carriers apart from their operation under federal control, and we so hold.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEDWARDS v. SLOCUM(1924)\nNo. 276\nArgued: January 10, 1924Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert Thorne, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the respondents, executors of the will of Mrs. Sage, to recover the amount of a tax paid under protest. The tax was levied under the act of February 24, 1919, c. 18,  401, 40 Stat. 1057, 1096 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/4 b), \n\n[264 U.S. 61, 62]\n\u00a0\n which imposes upon 'the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of this Act' taxes equal to specified percentages of the net estate determined as provided in section 403 (section 6336 3\/4 d). Mrs. Sage left an estate of $49,129,256.99. She bequeathed specified sums amounting to $1,285,000 for charitable purposes, $8,618,079.55 for purposes other than charitable, and the residue to charitable and educational institutions named. It is admitted that in estimating the tax now in question there is to be deducted from the gross estate the sum of $ 3,789,321.74 for debts and expenses and the charitable gifts of $1,285,000. These with the gifts to individuals above stated would leave a residue of $ 35,436,855.70, which the executors contend is exempt by the statute. Adding to the sums admitted to be exempt the residue thus arrived at and the statutory exemption of $50,000 the amount for which exemption is claimed will be $40,561,177.44, leaving a taxable remainder of $8,568,079. 55. The Government required the payment of an additional sum reached by deducting from the exempted estate the amount of the tax to be paid, or in other words, adding the amount of the tax to the taxable estate. The suit is to recover this additional sum. The executors prevailed in the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals after a discussion with which the Government well might have remained satisfied. 287 Fed. 651.\n The Government's argument turns largely upon the consideration that a residue is only what is left after the payment of paramount claims. But this is not a tax upon a residue, it is a tax upon a transfer of his net estate by a decedent, a distinction marked by the words that we have quoted from the statute, and previously commented upon at length in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 49\n, 77 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 747. It comes into existence before and is independent of the receipt of the property by the legatee. It taxes, as Hansen, Death Duties, puts it in a passage \n\n[264 U.S. 61, 63]\n\u00a0\n cited in \n178 U.S. 49\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 751 'not the interest to which some person succeeds on a death, but the interest which ceased by reason of the death.' It levies a sum equal to a certain percentage of the value of the net estate, and provides the criteria by which the net estate shall be ascertained. It thus manifestly assumes that the net estate will be ascertained before the tax is computed. The Government offers an algebraic formula by which it would solve the problems raised by two mutually dependent indeterminates. It fairly might be answered, as said by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that 'algebraic formulae are not lightly to be imputed to legislators' but it appears to us that the structure of the statute is sufficient to exclude the imputation. As further remarked below, the theory departs from the long established practice of the law not to regard the incidence of a tax in the levying of a tax, and the position of the Government is contrary to the expressed intent of the statute to encourage charitable bequests. It is inconsistent with itself also in maintaining that while the distribution of the burden of taxation among the several beneficiaries is a matter of state regulation, the residue is not to be diminished by the state inheritance tax but only by the estate tax of the United States.\n Judgment affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nELECTRIC BOAT CO. v. U S(1924)\nNo. 159\nArgued: Decided: January 28, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 621, 622]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Cean S. Edmonds, of New York City, Frederick P. Fish, of Boston, Mass., William H. Davis, of New York City, and Charles J. O'Neill, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 621, 625]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., Robert H. Lovett, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Harry E. Knight and L. G. Miller, Sp. Asst. Attys. Gen., for the United States. \n\n[263 U.S. 621, 626]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit upon a contract made between the claimant and the United States on April 2, 1912. The contract \n\n[263 U.S. 621, 627]\n\u00a0\n headed 'Shop License,' recites that the claimant is 'owner of the invention known as Steam Generator for Automobile Torpedoes covered by applications' of which it is necessary to mention only one, dated March 29, 1909; licenses the United States to manufacture and use torpedoes equipped with Steam Generators covered by the application to the end of the term for which patent may be granted, and binds the United States to pay at certain rates for such torpedoes. The claimant alleged that the United States had used the devices covered by claims 1, 5 and 13 of letters patent issued upon the above application on August 20, 1912. The Court of Claims found that those devices had not been used by the United States, but that the mechanism actually used by it was practically identical with that of a rival, the E. W. Bliss Company, that had been successfully tested in the fall of 1911, before the date of the above contract and before the plaintiff had attempted but failed to satisfy the same tests.\n When this contract was made the United States had not seen the applications, which were the claimant's secret. Both parties knew that the Government was dealing also with a rival concern, and the United States at least, and probably the claimant, knew that the rival had satisfied the Government's tests, which the claimant had not then done. It could not be believed that the contract meant a blind acceptance of liability for whatever might be in an undisclosed document. It did not; what it aimed at was a specific device which it was given to understand had been invented. We do not argue this at length because the proposition is accepted by the claimant.\n'The purpose of the license agreement was to secure to appellee the right to use the steam generator devised by Davison, regardless of any question as to the validity of patents he might obtain or as to the scope of their claims.'\n\n The dealings began with proposals for applying a system to existing torpedoes that would double their range, illustrated by a \n\n[263 U.S. 621, 628]\n\u00a0\n drawing showing the general arrangement of the device, identifying it but not disclosing it in detail. They ended in the contract, which went further, but undoubtedly had reference to a system the general nature of which was understood.\n We must take it on this record that at the time certain elements in the construction of self-moving torpedoes were well known. The front end contained the explosive. Behind that was a chamber of compressed air that was transmitted to an engine moving the propeller through a pipe with a valve that reduced the pressure of the condensed air to the desired point and kept it constant. The moving force was enhanced by heating the air after it left the valve. This was done by passing it through a combustion chamber into which was forced alcohol or other fuel. The fuel was in a third chamber and was carried to the place of combustion by the condensed air through a second pipe from beyond the reducing valve. It was ignited when the shell was launched. More was needed to carry the torpedo the distance required to make it usable in modern warfare. It was understood that the result could be accomplished and danger to the contrivance from excessive heat avoided by the introduction of water into the combustion chamber where it would become steam. The Bliss Company had given this knowledge a practical form, and there is no warrant in the record as it comes to us for suggesting that the claimant had anything to do with the Bliss Company's success, or that the Government had any reason for thinking that it had. In deciding what the Government reasonably supposed that it was buying these facts are important and what may have been contained in the undisclosed application is of little or no weight. Whatever may have been the rights of the claimant as against the Bliss Company the Government was entitled to assume that they did not extend to the above elements, separately or combined. \n\n[263 U.S. 621, 629]\n\u00a0\n Manifestly on these facts the Government is not estopped to show that its contract applied only within narrow limits. If the facts were as it has a right to suppose them to be, the contract necessarily was so limited. The Government thought that it might be that the claimant had found a more perfect way to do what was wanted and what the Bliss Company already had done, but on the record before us it would be monstrous to suppose that it was undertaking to pay the claimant for the Bliss Company product. The claimant was thought by the Government to have failed in its undertaking and therefore its device was laid aside. That device had certain peculiarities not repeated by the Bliss Company's, but the claimant relies and has to reply here upon the broad contention that the introduction of water to the combustion chamber in an effective way belongs to it, which seems unlikely in view of the previous British patent to Sodeau, in 1907, and others, and which it seems to us clearly might have been found, as by implication it was found, by the Court of Claims, not to have been the assumption or the meaning of the contract. So far as appears the use of water by the Bliss Company owed nothing to Davison, the claimant's assignor, but very closely embodied the suggestions of Sodeau and other predecessors in the field. We cannot say as matter of law that the Court of Claims was wrong.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nENDICOTT-JOHNSON CORPORATION v. ENCYCLOPEDIA PRESS(1924)\nNo. 41\nArgued: Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 285, 286]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Maurice E. Page, of Endicott, N. Y., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Thomas B. Merchant, of Binghamton, N. Y., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the constitutional validity of Section 1391 of the New York Code of Civil Procedure relating to the garnishment of wages and other choses in action of a judgment debtor.\n This section of the Code, as amended by the Laws of 1919, c. 278,1 provides that where a judgment has been recovered and an execution thereon returned unsatisfied, the judgment creditor may apply to the court without notice to the judgment debtor, and on satisfactory proof that any wages, debts, earnings, salary, income from trust funds or profits, are, or will thereafter become, due and owing to the judgment debtor, to the amount of twelve dollars or more per week, a judge or justice shall order that an execution issue against such wages, etc., of the judgment debtor. On presentation of such execution by the collecting officer to the person from whom such wages, etc., are or may become due and owing, the execution shall become a lien and continuing levy upon such wages, etc., to the amount specified in the execution, not exceeding ten per centum thereof, until the execution is fully satisfied. Any person to whom the execution is presented, who is or becomes indebted to the judgment debtor, shall, while the execution remains a lien upon the indebtedness, pay over to the officer the amount of the indebtedness prescribed \n\n[266 U.S. 285, 287]\n\u00a0\n by the execution until it is wholly satisfied; and such payment shall be a bar to any action therefor by the judgment debtor. If such person fails or refuses to pay over to the officer the percentage of such indebtedness, he shall be liable to an action therefor by the judgment creditor; and the amount recovered shall be applied towards the payment of the execution. Either party may apply at any time for such modification of the execution as shall be deemed just.\n The Encyclopedia Press, Inc., having duly recovered a judgment in the Supreme Court of New York against an employee of the Endicott Corporation receiving weekly wages of more than twelve dollars, was awarded, ex parte, under this section of the Code, an execution against his wages, directing the Corporation to pay over each week ten per centum thereof until the execution was satisfied. The Corporation failed and refused so to do, and continued to pay the employee his entire weekly wages as they became due.\n The Encyclopedia Press thereupon brought suit in the Supreme Court against the Corporation, upon the execution, for the accumulated percentages of the weekly wages that it had not paid over. Judgment was recovered; which, upon successive appeals, was affirmed, without opinions, by the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals. 200 App. Div. 847, 191 N. Y. S. 924; 234 N. Y. 627, 138 N. E. 474.2 The record was remitted to the Supreme Court, to which this writ of error was directed.\n The Corporation contends that section 1391 of the Code is in conflict with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it authorizes the issuance of a garnishment execution without notice to the judgment debtor or affording him a hearing, and, further, in that it inter feres \n\n[266 U.S. 285, 288]\n\u00a0\n with the liberty of contract between the judgment debtor and the garnishee.\n\n 1. \nWe assume for present purposes that a garnishee sued upon the execution has, by reason of the nature of the cause of action and the liability which this section imposes upon him, the right to challenge its constitutionality on the ground that it is wanting in due process as against the judgment debtor. See High v. Bank of Commerce, 95 Cal. 386, 30 P. 556, 29 Am. St. Rep. 121.\n The words 'due process of law,' when applied to judicial proceedings, 'mean a course of legal proceedings according to those rules and principles which have been established in our systems of jurisprudence for the protection and enforcement of private rights.' Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 733; Scott v. McNeal, \n154 \nU.S. 34, 46\n, 14 S. Ct. 1108. They require a proceeding which, observing the general rules thus established, follows forms of law appropriate to the case and just to the parties to be affected; and which, whenever it is necessary for the protection of the parties, gives them an opportunity to be heard respecting the justice of the judgment sought. Hagar v. Reclamation District, \n111 \nU.S. 701, 708\n, 4 S. Ct. 663. However, the established rules of our system of jurisprudence do not require that a defendant who has been granted an opportunity to be heard and has had his day in court, should, after a judgment has been rendered against him, have a further notice and hearing before supplemental proceedings are taken to reach his property in satisfaction of the judgment. Thus, in the absence of a statutory requirement, it is not essential that he be given notice before the issuance of an execution against his tangible property; after the rendition of the judgment he must take 'notice of what will follow,' no fruther notice being 'necessary to advance justice.' Ayres v. Campbell, 9 Iowa, 213, 216, 74 Am. Dec. 346; Reid v. Railway Co., 32 Pa. 257, 258; Foster v. Young, 172 Cal. 317, 322, 156 P. 476; McAnaw v. Matthis, 129 Mo. 142, 152, 31 S. W. 344. \n\n[266 U.S. 285, 289]\n\u00a0\n There is no more reason why the judgment debtor should be entitled to notice before the issue of an execution provided by statute as supplemental process to impound, in satisfaction of the judgment, choses in action due to him which cannot be reached by an ordinary execution. No established rule of our system of jurisprudence requires that such notice be given. On the contrary, it has been frequently held in the state courts that in the absence of a statutory requirement, it is not essential that the judgment debtor be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the issuance of such garnishment.

Hoyt, 68 Wis. 278, 286, 32 N. W. 128. In High v. Bank of Commerce, supra, in which the constitutionality of a garnishment statute was challenged because it did not require notice to the judgment debtor before issuance of the writ, the court said:\n'So far as the judgment debtor is concerned, he cannot complain; he is a party to the judgment, and is fully aware of the legal effect of it, viz., that what his debtors owe him can be applied, by proper proceedings in the action which is still pending, to the statisfaction of his judgment debts; and due process of law has been had to make him aware of that fact. If, then, anything is due from his debtor, he is not injured if it is so applied. If nothing is due him from such debtor, then the matter is of no concern to him. ... We therefore see no force in the suggestion that the statute is unconstitutional, in that the judgment debtor has under it no notice of the supplementary proceeding after judgment affecting his rights of property.' \n\n[266 U.S. 285, 290]\n\u00a0\n And in Ketcham v. Kent, supra, the court aptly said that if notice were given the judgment debtor before issuing the garnishment, 'the very advantage sought by the writ would possibly be of no avail, as a disposition could be made of the fund or property before service could be had.'\n\n We conclude that the provision of Section 1391 of the Code authorizing the issue of a garnishment execution on the ex parte application of the judgment creditor, is not in conflict with the due process clause.\n\n 2. \nNor does this section deprive the judgment debtor and garnishee of property without due process of law by interference with their liberty of contract. The statute in no wise prevents them from making such contract as they choose, but merely subjects the proceeds of the contract that become due the judgment debtor to the payment of the judgment rendered against him. This is not an interference with the right of contract within the meaning of the due process clause. Compare Philbrick v. Philbrick, 39 N. H. 468, 474, and Laird v. Carton, 196 N. Y. 169, 172, 89 N. E. 822, 25 L. R. A. (N. S.) 189. The suggestion that a substantial constitutional right of the garnishee is impaired because he may be put to some additional expense of bookkeeping in keeping his account with the judgment debtor, is plainly without merit.\n\n 3. \nIt is further contended that this section of the Code is void because contrary to public policy.

Shank, of Seattle, Wash., for plaintiffs in error.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action by the United States and United States Spruce Production Corporation, praying judgment against C. J. Erickson in the sum of $56,670. 35, and against the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company in the sum of $56,670.35; the ground of recovery being alleged breaches of certain contracts entered into between the Spruce Corporation and Erickson for the sale of certain logs belonging to the Spruce Corporation.\n There was a motion to strike out certain allegations of the complaint, and, being overruled, the complaint was demurred to. It and the motion to strike out were upon the ground that it appeared upon the face of the complaint that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action. The demurrer was overruled. An answer was then filed, and a reply thereto. In the answer there was also a denial of jurisdiction.\n Upon the issues thus made a jury was impaneled to try, which rendered a verdict, fixing the recovery against Erickson at $45,710.70, and against the Fidelity & Guaranty Company in the sum of $20,000. For these sums judgment was entered. \n\n[264 U.S. 246, 248]\n\u00a0\n Accompanying the writ of error is the certificate of the District Judge that a question of jurisdiction arose in the case. The certificate recited that on the motion to strike out and upon the demurrer the defendants raised the question of the jurisdiction of the court as a federal court to hear and determine the cause, 'and asserted that the United States of America was neither a necessary nor proper party to the said action'; it being one 'founded on contract between a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Washington on the one part and a citizen and resident of the state of Washington on the other part, the said court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the same, but this court in consideration of the allegations and facts' of the complaint 'was of the opinion that it had jurisdiction to hear and determine the case.'\n Even a summary of the facts of the certificate would be somewhat long. Fortunately we may dispense with it as the elemental facts are sufficiently set forth in Clallam County, Washington, v. United States, \n263 U.S. 341\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 121, 68 L. Ed. --, decided November 26, 1923\n\n\n Reference to that case is satisfactory to plaintiffs in error, they conceding that the connection of the United States with the litigation can be completely and accurately stated in the language of the Clallam Case by adding the following quotation from the case:\n'In short the Spruce Production Corporation was organized by the United States as an instrumentality for carrying on the war, all its property was conveyed to it by or bought with money coming from the United States and was used by it solely as means to that end, and when the war was over it stopped its work except so far as it found it necessary to go on in order to wind up its affairs. When the winding up is accomplished there will be a loss, but whatever assets may be realized will go to the United States.'\n\n In addition, it is only necessary to say that the Spruce Production Corporation is a corporation of the state of Washington. Erickson is a citizen of the state of Washington, \n\n[264 U.S. 246, 249]\n\u00a0\n and a resident of the Western district of the state, Northern division. The Fidelity & Guaranty Company is a corporation of the state of Maryland.\n The matter in dispute exceeds $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs. The United States joined as plaintiff to protect its asserted interests.\n In connection with the petition for a writ of error, the errors assigned are based on the action of the District Court and noted in its certificate, and that the 'court was without any jurisdiction whatsoever to enter any such judgment.'\n There is no question of the merits of the case or of the judgment. In other words, the question of jurisdiction is alone before us for decision, and, the letter of the complaint being regarded, there is no doubt of the jurisdiction of the court, for the first subdivision of section 24, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991) expressly gives the District Court jurisdiction of suits brought by the United States. This is such a suit. The United States is one of the plaintiffs and joined in the suit by way of asserting and seeking to enforce a right in whcih it claims to have a direct and legal interest. Judged by the complaint, the claim made by the United States is not frivolous or wholly without support but is real and substantial. In other words, it calls for consideration and determination. This involves an exercise of jurisdiction, whether the ultimate decision sustains or rejects the claim. Jurisdiction is power to decide the case either way, as the merits may require. The Fair v.

Henderson and E. P. Chamberlin, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent sued for the value of a lost package described by the bill of lading as 'one box bedding,' weighing 280 pounds, which actually contained 'miscellaneous household articles, together with two quilts and two pair woolen blankets.' In defense the railroad insisted that he misrepresented the true character of the contents and thereby prevented it from obtaining a released valuation which, according to the rate paid and provisions of the published tariffs, would not have exceeded $28.\n The writ must be dismissed. The inducing petition failed to give adequate information concerning the record \n\n[266 U.S. 185, 186]\n\u00a0\n and essential facts. Furness, Withy & Co. v.

The petition for certiorari seemed to represent that at time of shipment the consignor accepted a bill of lading misdescribing the contents of the package and accepted a rate based upon limited liability, as he must have known.\n It appears, however, that the shipper correctly reported the contents to the railroad, that he was not asked concerning value and made no representations relative thereto, that no rate was quoted, and that the undisclosed charges were to be collected at destination. The bill of lading contained no statement of value or rate and no provision restricting the carrier's liability to less than the actual worth. Section 8 provides:\n'The owner or consignee shall pay the freight and all other lawful charges accruing on said property, and, if required, shall pay the same before delivery. If upon inspection it is ascertained that the articles shipped are not those described in this bill of lading, the freight charges must be paid upon the articles actually shipped.'\n\n See New York Central R.

MALLOY(1924)\nNo. 553\nArgued: January 9, 1924Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 160, 161]\n\u00a0\n Mr. M. G. Wallace, of Richmond, Va., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Robert H. Dye, of Fayetteville, N. C., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Malloy Bros. brought this action against the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond in a state court, to recover $9,000, alleged to be the amount of a check drawn to their order upon the Bank of Lumber Bridge, N. C. The case was removed to the federal District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, where it was tried without a jury, and judgment rendered for plaintiffs (281 Fed. 997), which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals ( 291 Fed. 763).\n The check was drawn on November 30, 1920, delivered to and received by plaintiffs, and the amount credited \n\n[264 U.S. 160, 162]\n\u00a0\n to the drawer. It was properly indorsed and deposited with the Perry Banking Company, of Perry, Fla., for collection and credit, on December 1. A credit card was delivered to plaintiffs, upon which was printed:\n'Checks, drafts, etc., received for collection or deposit are taken at the risk of the indorser until actual payment is received.'\n\n A statute of Florida, then and ever since in force (Laws of Florida 1909, c. 5951, p. 146), provides as follows:\n'That when a check, draft, note or other negotiable instrument is deposited in a bank for credit, or for collection, it shall be considered due diligence on the part of the bank in the collection of any check, draft, note or other negotiable instrument so deposited, to forward en route the same without delay in the usual commercial way in use according to the regular course of business of banks, and that the maker, indorser, guarantor or surety of any check, draft, note or other negotiable instrument, so deposited, shall be liable to the bank until actual final payment is received, and that when a bank receives for collection any check, draft, note or other negotiable instrument and forwards the same for collection, as herein provided, it shall only be liable after actual final payment is received by it, except in case of want of due diligence on its part, as aforesaid.'\n\n The Perry Banking Company indorsed and transmitted the check to a bank at Jacksonville, Fla., which, in turn, indorsed and transmitted it, on account of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, to a bank at Atlanta, Ga., and by the latter bank it was transmitted for collection to the Richmond bank, defendant herein.\n On December 10, 1920, the Richmond bank transmitted the check, together with several other small checks, to the Lumber Bridge bank for collection and return. The latter containing these checks, by regular course of mail, should have been received, and, so far as appears, was received, by the Lumber Bridge bank on \n\n[264 U.S. 160, 163]\n\u00a0\n Saturday, December 11th. On Tuesday, December 14th, the check in question was stamped 'Paid' and charged to the account of the drawer, and on the same day the Lumber Bridge bank transmitted to the Richmond bank its draft on the Atlantic Banking & Trust Company, of Greensboro, N. C., for the aggregate amount of the checks, including the one here in question. The draft was received by the Richmond bank on December 15th, and immediately forwarded to the bank at Greensboro for payment. On December 17th the Greensboro bank notified the Richmond bank by wire that the Lumber Bridge bank did not have sufficient funds to its credit to pay the draft. Thereupon the Richmond bank wired the Lumber Bridge bank that its draft had been dishonored and called upon it to make it good. The Lumber Bridge bank answered, promising to do so. It failed, however, and the Richmond bank thereupon sent a representative to Lumber Bridge, who reached there on the morning of December 20th, and demanded payment of the draft from the cashier of the Lumber Bridge bank. The cashier of that bank, after stating that it did not have sufficient funds to pay the dishonored draft, promised that steps would be taken to meet it.\n On December 21st the representative of the Richmond bank was informed that the dishonored draft could not be paid, and on the same day the Richmond bank notified the Atlanta bank of the situation, and this notice was promptly transmitted to the plaintiffs. The amount of the check was thereupon charged by the Richmond bank to the Atlanta bank, which, in turn, charged the amount to its immediate correspondent, and so on until it was finally charged back to the plaintiffs.\n In view of the conclusion which we have reached, we find it necessary to consider but two questions:\n\n\n (1)\n Can the present action be maintained by plaintiffs, Malloy Bros., against the Richmond bank? and \n\n[264 U.S. 160, 164]\n\u00a0\n (2) If so, did the failure of the Richmond bank to require payment of the Malloy check in money, and its acceptance of what turned out to be a worthless draft in lieu thereof, create a liability against it and in favor of Malloy Bros. for the amount of the loss?\n First. The state decisions in respect of the liability of a correspondent bank to the owner of a check forwarded for collection by the initial bank of deposit are in conflict beyond the possibility of reconciliation. A number of states, following the 'New York rule,' so called, have held that there is no such direct liability, but that the initial bank alone is responsible to the owner. On the other hand, an equal, if not a greater, number of states, following the 'Massachusetts rule,' have held exactly the contrary, viz. that the initial bank, by the mere fact of deposit for collection, is authorized to employ subagents, who thereupon become the agents of the owner and directly responsible to him for their defaults. This court, in Exchange National Bank v. Third National Bank, \n112 U.S. 276\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 141, after reviewing the two lines of decisions, approved the 'New York rule.' But the rule may, of course be varied by contract, express or implied. \n112 U.S. 289\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 141. Here the relations of the drawee to the initial bank of deposit are controlled by the Florida statute with respect to which it must be presumed they dealt with each other. This statute had the effect of importing the 'Massachusetts rule' into the contract, with the result that the initial bank had implied authority to intrust the collection of the check to a subagent and that subagent, in turn, to another, and the risk of any default or neglect on their part, rested upon the owners. \n112 U.S. 281\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 141. It follows that the action was properly brought against the Richmond bank.\n Second. For the purposes of the case, we assume the correctness of the decision below, holding that the Richmond bank was not negligent in sending the check directly \n\n[264 U.S. 160, 165]\n\u00a0\n to the bank on which it was drawn, and consider only whether the acceptance of an exchange draft, found to be worthless, instead of money, creates an enforceable liability\n It is settled law that a collecting agent is without authority to accept for the debt of his principal anything but 'that which the law declares to be a legal tender, or which is be common consent considered and treated as money, and passes at such at par.' Ward v. Smith, 7 Wall. 447, 452 (19 L. Ed. 207). The rule applies to a bank receiving commercial paper for collection, and if such bank accepts the check of the party bound to make payment and surrenders the paper, it is responsible to the owner for any resulting loss. Fifth National Bank v. Ashworth, 123 Pa. 212, 218, 16 Atl. 596, 2 L. R. A. 491; Hazlett v. Commercial National Bank, 132 Pa. 118, 125, 19 Atl. 55; Bank v. Bank, 151 Mo. 320, 329, 52 S. W. 265, 74 Am. St. Rep. 527; Essex County National Bank v. Bank of Montreal, 7 Biss. 193, Fed. Cas. No. 4532; Noble v. Doughten, 72 Kan. 336, 351, 353, 82 Pac. 1048, 3 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1167; Anderson v. Gill, 79 Md. 312, 317 29 Atl. 527, 25 L. R. A. 200, 47 Am. St. Rep 402; Bank of Antigo v. Union Trust Co ., 149 Ill. 343, 351, 36 N. E. 1029, 23 L. R. A. 611. It is unnecessary to cite other decisions, since they are all practically uniform. Anderson v. Gill, supra, presented a situation practically the same as the we are here dealing with, and the Supreme Court of Maryland, in disposing of it, said:\n'Now, a check on a bank or banker is payable in money, and in nothing else. Morse, Banks & Banking (2d Ed.) p. 268. The drawer, having funds to his credit with the drawee, has a right to assume that the payee will, upon presentation, exact in payment precisely what the check was given for, and that he will not accept, in lieu thereof, something for which it had not been drawn. It is certainly not within his contemplation that the payee should upon presentation, instead of requiring the cash to be paid, accept at the drawer's risk a check of the drawee upon some other bank or \n\n[264 U.S. 160, 166]\n\u00a0\n banker. The holder had a right to make immediate demand for payment upon receipt of Anderson's check, though she was not bound to do so. When her agent, the Old Town Bank-the collecting bank being the agent of the holder ( Dodge v. Freedman's Sav. & Tru. Co., \n93 U.S. 379\n)-did make demand it was only authorized to receive money (Ward v. Smith, \n74 U.S. 451\n); and the acceptance by the collecting agent of anything else rendered it as liable to the holder as though it had collected the cash.'\n\n Acceptance of the draft by the Richmond bank as payment of the Malloy check had the effect of releasing the drawer and therefore materially altering the relations of the parties. Technically, there resulted a transfer of the drawer's funds and his right of action against the drawee bank, and previous rights and obligations between the owners of the check and drawer were superseded. It follows-this result having been brought about by the unauthorized act of the Richmond bank, standing in that transaction in the relation of agent to the owners of the check-that such owners are entitled to recover from the Richmond bank for the loss which they sustained, unless the case falls within some exception to the general rule.\n And as to this the Richmond bank says: (1) That its immediate correspondent, from whom it received the check, was bound by a regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, which authorized the method of collection pursued, and that, since that correspondent was the agent of the owners of the check in the transaction, they are likewise bound, (2) that the method was justified by a custom, binding upon Malloy Bros. We consider these contentions in their order.\n\n 1. \nThe regulation relied on, so far as pertinent, is to the effect that a Federal Reserve Bank will act as agent only in handling items for member and nonmember banks, who are required to authorize 'its Federal Reserve Bank \n\n[264 U.S. 160, 167]\n\u00a0\n to send checks for collection to banks on which checks were drawn and, except for negligence, Federal Reserve Banks will assume no liability.' Regulation J (8) of 1920. This regulation, while it contemplates the sending of checks for collection to the drawee banks, does not expressly permit the acceptance of payment other than in money. It is insisted, however, that the authority to send checks to the drawee bank carries with it, by necessary implication, authority to accept a draft in payment from the drawee. We assume, for the purposes of the argument, that the obligation which the law imposes to collect only in money may be varied by a regulation, clearly and positively so providing, although, in terms, it relates only to the banks inter se, upon the ground that the owner of the check is bound by the knowledge and consent of his subagent. But to justify an extension by implication of the terms of the regulation, it must be made to appear, at least, that the addition sought to be annexed is a necessary means to carry into effect the authority expressly given by the regulation. See First National Bank v. Missouri, \n263 U.S. 640\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 213, 68 L. Ed. --, decided January 28, 1924. It follows, from this limitation upon the extent and purpose of implied powers, that a distinct and independent power cannot be brought into existence by implication from the grant of another distinct power. In other words, authority to do a specific thing carries with it by implication the power to do whatever is necessary to effectuate the thing authorized-not to do another and separate thing, since that would be, not to carry the authority granted into effect, but to add an authority beyond the terms of the grant. The authority expressed by the regulation is 'to send checks for collection to banks on which checks were drawn'; the authority now sought to be annexed by implication is 'to accept exchange drafts in payment,' instead of money as required by law. That neither is a necessary means of carrying the other into effect is clear. Nor are \n\n[264 U.S. 160, 168]\n\u00a0\n they necessary to each other in the sense that they are corolary or dependent. Certainly a check may be sent for collection to the drawee bank without entailing the necessity of remitting the amount in the form of exchange. Currency itself may be sent, and, as will appear presently, frequently is sent. The first form of remittance, to be sure, is more convenient; but it is not of such necessity as to exclude the second on the score of impracticability. There is nothing to prevent the sending bank from requiring the drawee to remit currency as a condition upon which the check may be satisfied and charged to the account of the drawer. We must not lose sight of the fact that we are here dealing with two distinct rules of law, both of which are sought to be avoided: (a) That which forbids a bank having paper for collection to use the drawee bank as a collecting agent; and (b) that which forbids a collecting agent accepting anything but money in payment. The first rule is probably based upon the theory that the drawee is not a suitable agent for the enforcement of his own obligation, and that commercial paper calling upon him to pay should not be surrendered to and satisfied by him, with the consequent release of the drawer, except upon previous or contemporaneous payment. The second rule proceeds upon the fact that the obligation of the drawee is to pay in money and nothing else. Plainly, the two rules are of such nature that one may be abrogated without the other; and it is obvious, since the law imposes upon a collecting agent the duty to collect in money, that none of the various subagents receiving the paper to be collected upon the basis of that duty can waive the requirement of the law in favor of the agent to whom it is transmitted. Indeed, in transmitting the check here in question to the Richmond bank, the intermediate banks, in effect, served only as instruments for effectuating the transmission. In essence and in substance the check was delivered by its owners to the \n\n[264 U.S. 160, 169]\n\u00a0\n Richmond bank; it is to that bank, as we have said, they must look for redress; and the responsibility of that bank is the same as though the check had been delivered directly to it for collection by the owners.\n In this connection, certain state statutes are also referred to; but, if applicable, we find nothing in them that justifies a different conclusion from that reached in respect of the regulation just considered. Their provisions are in substance the same.\n\n 2. \nFinally, it is urged that the acceptance of the drawee's own draft, instead of money, was justified by custom. The testimony relied upon to establish the custom follows:\n'The business of check collecting is handled by the Federal Reserve Bank in a way very similar to that in which it is handled by collecting banks throughout the country. When one bank receives checks on another in a distant city, it usually sends them to the bank on which they are drawn or to some other bank in that city, and receives settlement by means of an exchange draft drawn by the bank to which the checks are sent upon some one of its correspondents. When checks are sent with the expectation that the bank receiving them will remit at once, we call it sending for collection and return. When this is done, the bank upon which the checks are drawn is expected to cancel the checks and charge them to the accounts of the drawers, and to remit by means of its exchange draft or by a shipment of currency. An exchange draft is used more frequently than a shipment of currency.'\n\n It thus appears that the custom, if otherwise established, does not fix a definite and uniform method of remittance. When checks are sent for collection and return, the bank is expected to cancel the checks, and charge them to the account of the drawers, and remit 'by means of its exchange draft of by a shipment of currency,' the \n\n[264 U.S. 160, 170]\n\u00a0\n former being used more frequently than the latter. Whether the choice of methods is at the election of the drawee bank or the collecting bank does not appear. If it be the latter, it would seem to result that the election to have remittance by draft instead of currency, being wholly a matter of its discretion, or even of its caprice, as to which the owners are not consulted, would be at its peril, rather than at the risk of the owners of the check.\n But the proof shows that the alleged custom was not known to plaintiffs, and they could not be held to it without such knowledge, because, all other reasons aside, by its uncertainty and lack of uniformity, it furnishes no definite standard by which the terms of the implied consent sought to be established thereby can be determined. It furnishes no rule by which it can be ascertained when an exchange draft shall be remitted and when currency shall be required, or who is to exercise the right of election. 'A custom to pay two pence in lieu of tithes is good; but to pay sometimes two pence, and sometimes three pence, as the occupier of the land pleases, is bad for uncertainty.' 1 Bl. Comm. 78. An alleged custom to remit either in exchange or in currency at somebody's option means nothing more than a practice sometimes to remit by exchange and sometimes not, and therefore lacks the essential qualities of certainty and uniformity to make it a custom of accepting payment by exchange draft binding upon the owners of the check. Oerlicks v. Ford, 23 How. 49, 62; Kalamazoo Corset Co. v. Simon (C. C.) 129 Fed. 144, 146; Chicage, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Lindeman, 143 Fed. 946, 949, 75 C. C. A. 18; Foley v. Mason, 6 Md. 37, 50; Wilson v. Willes, 7 East, 121, 127. A custom to do a thing in either one or the other of two modes, as the person relying upon it may choose, can furnish no basis for an implication that the person sought to be bound by it had in mind one mode rather than the other.\n It is said, however, that there is a custom among banks to settle among themselves by means of drafts, so well \n\n[264 U.S. 160, 171]\n\u00a0\n established and notorious that judicial notice of it may be taken. But the usage here invoked is not that, but is one of special application to a case where the collection of a check is intrusted to the very bank upon which the check is drawn and where payment is accepted in a medium which the contract, read in the light of the law, forbids. The special situation with which we are dealing is controlled by a definite rule of law which it is sought to upset by a custom to the contrary effect. It is not now necessary to consider the effect of a custom which contravenes a settled rule of law or the limits within which such a custom can be upheld. See Barnard v. Kellogg, 10 Wall. 383, 390, 394. Decisions upon that question are in great confusion. But whatever may be the doctrine in other respects certainly a custom relied upon to take the place of a settled principle of law, and therefore to have the force of law, ought to be as definite and specific in negativing the principle as the law which it assumes to supplant is in affirming it.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v.

St.  8836i), and in alleged pursuance of a resolution of the Senate passed on August 9, 1921. The purpose of the petitions is to require production of records, contracts, memoranda and correspondence for inspection and making copies. They were denied by the District Court. 283 Fed. 999. The resolution directs the Commission to investigate the tobacco situation as to domestic and export trade with particular reference to market price to producers, etc. The act directs the Commission to prevent the use of unfair methods of competition in commerce and provides for a complaint by the Commission, a hearing and a report, with an order to desist if it deems the use of a prohibited method proved. The Commission and the party concerned are both given a resort to the Circuit \n\n[264 U.S. 298, 304]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals. Section 5 (Comp. St.  8836e). By section 6 (Comp. St.  8836f) the Commission shall have power (a) to gather information concerning, and to investigate the business, conduct, practices and management of any corporation engaged in commerce, except banks and common carriers, and its relation to other corporations and individuals; (b) to require reports and answers under oath to specific questions furnishing the Commission such information as it may require on the above subjects; ( d) upon the direction of the President or either House of Congress to investigate and report the facts as to alleged violation of the Anti-Trust Acts (Comp. St.  8820 et seq.) By section 9 (Comp. St.  8836i) for the purposes of this act the Commission shall at all reasonable times have access to, for the purposes of examination, and the right to copy any documentary evidence of any corporation being investigated or proceeded against and shall have power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all such documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation. In case of disobedience an order may be obtained from a District Court. Upon application of the Attorney General the District Courts are given jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus to require compliance with the act or any order of the commission made in pursuance thereof. The petitions are filed under this clause and the question is whether orders of the Commission to allow inspection and copies of the documents and correspondence referred to were authorized by the act.\n The petitions allege that complaints have been filed with the Commission charging the respondents severally with unfair competition by regulating the prices at which their commodities should be resold, set forth the Senate resolution, and the resolutions of the Commission to conduct an investigation under the authority of sections 5 and 6(a), being Comp. St.  8836e, 8836f, and in pursuance of the Senate resolution, and for the further purose of gathering and compiling information concerning the business, conduct and practices, etc., of \n\n[264 U.S. 298, 305]\n\u00a0\n each of the resopondent companies. There are the necessary formal allegations and a prayer that unless the accounts, books, records, documents, memoranda, contracts, papers and correspondence of the respondents are immediately submitted for inspection and examination and for the purpose of making copies thereof, a mandamus issue requiring, in the case of the American Tobacco Company, the exhibition during business hours when the Commission's agent requests it, of all letters and telegrams received by the Company from, or sent by it to all of its jobber customers, between January 1, 1921 to December 31, 1921, inclusive. In the case of the P. Lorillard Company the same requirement is made and also all letters, telegrams or reports from or to its salesmen, or from or to all tobacco jobbers' or wholesale grocers' associations, all contracts or arrangements with such associations, and correspondence and agreements with a list of corporations named.\n The Senate resolution may be laid on one side as it is not based on any alleged violation of the Anti-Trust acts, within the requirement of section 6 (d) of the act. United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co ., \n236 \nU.S. 318, 329\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 363. The complaints, as to which the Commission refused definite information to the respondents, and one at least of which, we understand, has been dismissed, also may be disregarded for the moment, since the Commission claims an unlimited right of access to the respondents' papers with reference to the possible existence of practices in violation of section 5.\n The mere facts of carrying on a commerce not confined within State lines and of being organized as a corporation do not make men's affairs public, as those of a railroad company now may be. Smith v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 33, 43\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 30. Anyone who respects the spirit as well as the letter of the Fourth Amendment would be loath to believe that Congress intended to authorize \n\n[264 U.S. 298, 306]\n\u00a0\n one of its subordinate agencies to sweep all our traditions into the fire ( Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447, 479\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1125), and to direct fishing expeditions into private papers on the possibility that they may disclose evidence of crime. We do not discuss the question whether it could do so if it tried, as nothing short of the most explicit language would induce us to attribute to Congress that intent. The interruption of business, the possible revelation of trade secrets, and the expense that compliance with the Commission's wholesale demand would cause are the least considerations. It is contrary to the first principles of justice to allow a search through all the respondents' rcords, relevant or irrelevant, in the hope that something will turn up. The unwillingness of this Court to sustain such a claim is shown in Harriman v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n211 U.S. 407\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 115, and as to correspondence, even in the case of a common carrier, in United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 318, 335\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 363. The question is a different one where the State granting the charter gives its Commission power to inspect.\n The right of access given by the statute is to documentary evidence- not to all documents, but to such documents as are evidence. The analogies of the law do not allow the party wanting evidence to call for all documents in order to see if they do not contain it. Some ground must be shown for supposing that the documents called for do contain it. Formerly in equity the ground must be found in admissions in the answer. Wigram, Discovery (2d Ed.)  293. We assume that the rule to be applied here is more liberal but still a ground must be laid and the ground and the demand must be reasonable. Essgee Co. v. United States, \n262 \nU.S. 151, 156\n, 157 S., 43 Sup. Ct. 514. A general subpoena in the form of these petitions would be bad. Some evidence of the materiality of the papers demanded must be produced. Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43, 77\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 370. In the \n\n[264 U.S. 298, 307]\n\u00a0\n state case relied on by the Government, the requirement was only to produce books and papers that were relevant to the inquiry. Consolidated Rendering Co. v. Vermont, \n207 U.S. 541\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 178, 12 Ann. Cas. 658. The form of the subpoena was not the question in Wheeler v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 478, 488\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 158.\n The demand was not only general but extended to the records and correspondence concerning business done wholly within the State. This is made a distinct ground of objection. We assume for present purposes that even some part of the presumably large mass of papers relating only to intrastate business may be so connected with charges of unfair competition in interstate matters as to be relevant, Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 520\n, 521 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229, but that possibility does not warrant a demand for the whole. For all that appears the corporations would have been willing to produce such papers as they conceived to be relevant to the matter in hand. See Terminal Taxicab Co. v. District of Columbia, \n241 \nU.S. 252, 256\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 583, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 765. If their judgment upon that matter was not final, at least some evidence must be offered to show that it was wrong. No such evidence is shown.\n We have considered this case on the general claim of authority put forward by the Commission. The argument for the Government attaches some force to the investigations and proceedings upon which the Commission had entered. The investigations and complaints seem to have been only on hearsay or suspicion-but even if they were induced by substantial evidence under oath the rudimentary principles of justice that we have laid down would apply. We cannot attribute to Congress an intent to defy the Fourth Amendment or even to come so near to doing so as to raise a serious question of constitutional law. United States v.

RAYMOND BROS-CLARK CO(1924)\nNo. 102\nArgued: November 27, 1923Decided: January 7, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Adrien F. Busick, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.[ Federal Trade Commission v. Raymond Bros-Clark Co \n263 U.S. 565\n (1924) ]\n\n\n[263 U.S. 565, 568]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Emmet Tinley, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ brings up for review a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals which set aside an order of the Federal Trade Commission requiring the Raymond Bros.-Clark Company to desist from a method of competition held to be prohibited by the Trade Commission Act of September 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717 (Comp. St.  8836a-8836k).\n By Section 5 of that Act 'unfair methods of competition' in interstate commerce are declared unlawful, and the Commission is empowered and directed to prevent their use.\n The Commission, in January, 1920, issued a complaint charging the Raymond Company with acts and practices the purpose and effect of which was to cut off the supplies purchased by the Basket Stores Company, a competitor, from the T. A. Snider Preserve Company, stifle and prevent competition by the Stores Company, and interfere with the right of the Stores Company and the Snider Company to deal freely with each other in interstate commerce. The Raymond Company answered, and evidence was taken. The Commission made a report, stating its findings of fact and conclusions. \n\n[263 U.S. 565, 569]\n\u00a0\n The material facts shown by the findings are: The Raymond Company and the Stores Company are dealers in groceries, with their principal places of business and warehouses in Nebraska. They buy groceries in wholesale quantities from manufacturers in other States, which are shipped to their warehouses and resold to customers within and outside of Nebraska. Each does a annual business of approximately $2,500,000. The Raymond Company sells exclusively at wholesale. The Stores Company operates a chain of retail stores, but also sells at wholesale. In its wholesale trade, which constitutes about ten per cent. of its total business it is a competitor of the Raymond Company. The Snider Company is a manufacturer of groceries, with its office in Illinois. In September, 1918, it sold groceries to the Raymond Company, the Stores Company and other neighboring dealers. These groceries were shipped in interstate commerce in a 'pool' car to the Raymond Company for distribution among the several purchasers. \n1\n The Raymond Company, upon thus learning of the sale to the Stores Company, delayed the delivery of its portion of the groceries, to the hindrance and obstruction of its business, and wrote to the Snider Company, protesting against the sale direct to the Stores Company and asking for the allowance of the jobber's profit on such sale. \n2\n Later, the Raymond Company declined to pay the Snider Company until this commission was allowed, and threatened to cease business with it and return all goods purchased from it then \n\n[263 U.S. 565, 570]\n\u00a0\n in stock, unless it allowed this commission and discontinued direct sales to the Stores Company; and, thereafter, an attempted settlement of the controversy having failed, the Raymond Company ceased to purchase from the Snider Company.\n The conclusions of the Commission were: That the conduct of the Raymond Company tended to, and did, unduly hinder competition between the Stores Company and others similarly engaged in business; that the purpose of the Raymond Company was also to press the Snider Company to a selection of customers, in restraint of its trade, and to restrict the Stores Company in the purchase of commodities in competition with other buyers; and that the conduct of the Raymond Company tended to the accomplishment of this purpose.\n The Commission thereupon adjudged that the method of competition in question was prohibited by the Act, and ordered the Raymond Company to desist from directly or indirectly-hindering or preventing any person, firm, or corporation in or from the purchase of groceries or like commodities direct from the manufacturers or producers, in interstate commerce, or attempting so to do; hindering or preventing any manufacturer, producer, or dealer in groceries and like commodities in or from the selection of customers in interstate commerce, or attempting so to do; and influencing or attempting to influence any such manufacturer, producer, or dealer not to accept as a customer any firm or corporation with which, in the exercise of a free judgment, he has, or may desire to have, such relationship.\n Upon a petition of the Raymond Company for review of this order, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the findings of fact did not show an unfair method of competition by the Raymond Company as to the Stores Company or others similarly engaged in business. The court said:\n'There is no finding that petitioner combined with \n\n[263 U.S. 565, 571]\n\u00a0\n any other person or corporation for the purpose of affecting the trade of the Basket Stores Company, or others similarly engaged in business. So far as petitioner itself is concerned, it had the positive and lawful right to select any particular merchandise which it wished to purchase, and to select any person or corporation from whom it might wish to make its purchase. The petitioner had the right to do this for any reason satisfactory to it, or for no reason at all. It had a right to announce its reason without fear of subjecting itself to liability of any kind. It also had the unquestioned right to discontinue dealing with any manufacturer, ... for any reason satisfactory to itself or for no reason at all. Any incidental result which might occur by reason of petitioner exercising a lawful right cannot be charged against petitioner as an unfair method of competition.'\n\n The decree setting aside the order of the Commission was thereupon entered. 280 Fed. 529.\n We pass, without determination, the preliminary contentions of the Raymond Company, that the findings of the Commission are not supported by the testimony, in many respects,3 and that, as both the complaint and the findings of fact relate merely to a controversy between it and a single manufacturer, over a single shipment of merchandise, the broad order of the Commission, commanding it to desist from all acts of like character with 'the- \n\n[263 U.S. 565, 572]\n\u00a0\n entire commercial world' is improvident, and cannot be sustained. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The gravamen of the contention in behalf of the Commission is that the conduct of the Raymond Company, acting alone and not in combination with others, in threatening the withdrawal of patronage from the Snider Company if it continued to sell goods to the Stores Company, constituted an unfair method of competition oppressive in its character, unlawful when tested by common law criteria, and having a dangerous tendency unduly to hinder competition.\n The words 'unfair method of competition,' as used in the Act, 'are clearly inapplicable to practices never heretofore regarded as opposed to good morals because characterized by deception, bad faith, fraud or oppression, or as against public policy because of their dangerous tendency unduly to hinder competition or create monopoly.' Federal Trade Comm. v. Gratz, \n253 \nU.S. 421, 427\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 572; Federal Trade Comm. v. Beech-Nut Co., \n257 U.S. 441\n, 453.5 If real competition is to continue, the right of the individual to exercise reasonable discretion in respect of his own business methods, must be preserved. Federal Trade Comm. v. Gratz, supra, p. 429 of 253 U. S., p. 572 of 40 Sup. Ct., p. 993 of 64 L. Ed.\n The present case discloses no elements of monopoly or oppression. So far as appears the Raymond Company has no dominant control of the grocery trade, and competition between it and the Stores Company is on equal terms. Nor do we find that the threatened withdrawal of its trade from the Snider Company was unlawful at the \n\n[263 U.S. 565, 573]\n\u00a0\n common law, or had any dangerous tendancy unduly to hinder competition.\n It is the right, 'long recognized,' of a trader engaged in an entirely private business, 'freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to the parties with whom he will deal.'

Mississippi, \n217 \nU.S. 433, 440\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 535. Or he may stop dealing with a wholesaler who he thinks is acting unfairly in trying to undermine his trade. Eastern States Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, \n234 U.S. 614\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788; United States v. Colgate & Co., supra, \n250 U.S. 307\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 465, 7 A. L. R. 443. Likewise a wholesale dealer has the right to stop dealing with a manufacturer 'for reasons sufficient to himself.' And he may do so because he thinks such manufacturer is undermining his trade by selling either to a competing wholesaler or to a retailer competing with his own customers. Such other wholesaler or retailer has the reciprocal right to stop dealing with the manufacturer. This each may do, in the exercise of tree competition, leaving it to the manufacturer to determine which customer, in the exercise of his own judgment, he desires to retain.\n A different case would of course be presented if the Raymond Company had combined and agreed with other \n\n[263 U.S. 565, 574]\n\u00a0\n wholesale dealers that none would trade with any manufacturer who sold to other wholesale dealers competing with themselves, or to retail dealers competing with their customers. An act lawful when done by one may become wrongful when done by many acting in concert, taking on the form of a conspiracy which may be prohibited if the result be hurtful to the public or to the individual against whom the concerted action is directed.

See also Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 U.S. 291\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 96, 68 L. Ed. --.\n We conclude that the Raymond Company in threatening to withdraw its trade from the Snider Company exercised its lawful right, and that its conduct did not constitute an unfair method of competition within the meaning of the Act. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The facts that the Snider Company's office is in Illinois and that it shipped these groceries in interstate commerce, are not stated in the findings; but they otherwise appear in the record and are not disputed. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] It otherwise appears from the record that the ground of its protest and claim was its assertion that the Stores Company was 'nothing but a retail store.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Raymond Company insists that the testimony shows, among other things, that it did not intentionally delay the delivery of the groceries to the Stores Company; that the Stores Company is not its competitor in the wholesale business, but engaged in the retail business, selling groceries to consumers in competition with other retail dealers to whom the Raymond Company sells at wholesale; and that it did not threaten the Snider Company with the withdrawal of patronage if it continued to sell to the Stores Company, but merely expressed surprise at the change made by the Snider Company from its former policy of selling only to wholesalers, and declared that it would not have made its own purchases had it known of this change. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Circuit Court of Appeals stated, in the outset of its opinion, that, in any event, as the proceeding related to the use of an unfair method of competition against the Stores Company, the order of the Commission, being 'as broad as the business world,' would have to be modified, if sustained in any particular.

Taylor and Hugh W. Davis, both of Norfolk, Va., for appellant.\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The city of Portsmouth and the county of Norfolk, Va., made a lease of the Norfolk Ferries, operating between Portsmouth, Norfolk, and Berkeley, for a term of ten years, beginning April 1, 1909, to plaintiff's assignor. The properties consisted of boats, their equipment, wharves, and other property used for the operation of the ferries. All the property turned over to the lessee, except land, was taken by the lessee upon the inventory and valuation thereof made by a board of appraisers selected under a prior lease then about to expire. It was agreed that at the termination of the lease the property so accepted, including any boats which might be purchased or built by the lessee for the operation of the ferries, and \n\n[266 U.S. 260, 262]\n\u00a0\n any improvements made by the lessee should be inventoried and valued by a board of five disinterested persons, and it was provided that, if such valuation should be less than the value of the property turned over to the lessee by the lessors, the lessee should pay the difference, but, if more, the lessors should pay the difference.\n Under date of October 8, 1918, the lessors, the plaintiff and the United States (acting by the Bureau of Industrial Housing and Transportation of the Department of Labor) made an agreement by which the United States took over the operation of the ferries. It was provided that the lease should terminate at the time of the turning over of the properties to the Bureau and that 'the appraisal ... provided for in said lease shall take place as of the time that the ferries shall be taken over by the Bureau, instead of at the regular termination of the said lease, as therein provided, and said appraisal shall be made in the same manner as if the said lease had regularly terminated at the date that the said ferries are taken over by the Bureau. ...' It was agreed that if, as a result of the appraisal, plaintiff was found to be entitled to any money from the lessors, it should be paid by the Bureau and charged to lessors, and that, if the lessors were found to be entitled to any money from the plaintiff, it should be paid to the Bureau and credited to lessors. The ferries were taken over, and their operation was commenced by the Bureau, November 1, 1918\n\n\n The appraised value of the properties as of March 31, 1909, was $152, 274.40. The appraised value as of October 31, 1918, determined under the agreement, was $164,928.68. This valuation, except as to certain items amounting to $33,688.65, was based on prewar conditions and values. The Court of Claims found that the value of the properties as of the last- mentioned date, based on war prices and values then prevailing, was $289, 575.80. \n\n[266 U.S. 260, 263]\n\u00a0\n It is clear that, under the agreement of October 8, 1918, the United States was bound-and it was stated by its counsel that it has been willing- to pay plaintiff the difference between the appraised value of the properties turned over to lessee, March 31, 1909, and the appraised value of those turned over by plaintiff, October 31, 1918. But by its petition in this action plaintiff asserted that it was entitled to have that value determined on the basis of prices prevailing October 31, 1918, alleged that this was $343,702.16, and prayed that the appraisers' valuation be set aside, and that the court determine the value and give plaintiff judgment against the United States for the amount thereof.\n The Court of Claims found the facts as indicated above. As a conclusion of law, it decided that the petition should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. It entered judgment that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and that the petition be dismissed.\n Plaintiff was not entitled to recover the value of the properties it turned over to the United States. There was no expropriation. The transfer was made under the agreement.\n The valuation under the agreement was not required to be made on the basis of war conditions and prices then prevailing. The appraisal was to take place as of the time, and it was to be made as if, the lease had terminated. The purpose of the two appraisals provided for in the lease- one at the beginning and the other at the end of the term-was to find the changes which had occurred in the value of the properties due to changes in condition of the things received by the lessee at the beginning and returned to lessors at the end of the term, and also the changes due to retirements, additions and betterments during the term. It is apparent from the provisions of the lease-and in his argument before the court plaintiff's \n\n[266 U.S. 260, 264]\n\u00a0\n counsel conceded-that it was not intended that any gain or loss to lessors or lessee should result from differences between unit prices existing at the beginning of the term and those prevailing at its expiration. Plainly, it was not the intention of the agreement to give plaintiff the benefit of high prices then prevailing. It was not the owner, and its lease was about to expire. On the basis of the appraisals provided for in the lease, it would have been entitled to receive no more than $12,654.28. The parties knew that prices in October, 1918, were much higher than those on which the appraisal of March 31, 1909, was made, and that, if they were to be taken as the basis of appraisal under the agreement, plaintiff, by mere rise of prices applicable to property it did not own, would profit enormously. It was not in position to exact any such amount. The provisions of the agreement show that the parties intended to make no change in the basis of valuation. The appraisal was to be made as if the lease had terminated, and on the same basis of prices and conditions. This so plainly appears from the language of the agreement that elucidation is not necessary.\n Plaintiff did not seek to recover on the basis of the appraisal made under the agreement with the United States, but on the contrary, it assailed that valuation as null and void. The only ground of attack relied on in this court was that the appraisers misconstrued and misapplied the agreement. But, as above indicated, we hold there was no misinterpretation. The facts found are not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to have the award set aside, or to any relief in a court of equity. Therefore the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to grant equitable relief need not be considered.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST NAT BANK OF COLUMBUS, OHIO, v. LOUISIANA HIGHWAY COMMISSION(1924)\nNo. 509\nArgued: Decided: March 17, 1924\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. M. Barrow, of Baton Rouge, La., and R. J. Wilson, of Harrisonburg, La., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Jurisdiction was invoked solely on the ground of diversity of citizenship. The District Court held that the required amount, $3,000, was not involved, and for that reason dismissed the case. Appeal was taken under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215). The appellees move to affirm under section 5 of rule 6.\n The complaint alleges that the appellant is the holder of real estate and a taxpayer in the parish of Jefferson, La.; that in 1919 state highway bonds were sold to provide funds for the construction of certain highways, one of which was to extend from Hammond to New Orleans, approximately paralleling the Illinois Central Railroad through the parishes of Tangipahoa, St. John \n\n[264 U.S. 308, 309]\n\u00a0\n the Baptist, St. Charles, and Jefferson, to the line of Orleans parish; that, in violation of law, contracts were let for partial construction of a portion of this highway on a route different from that fixed by law, and that some of the proceeds of the bond issue have been set aside for that purpose; that it is the intention of the highway commission forever to abandon construction of a part of the prescribed highway-and it is averred that such abandonment and the diversion and exhaustion of the highway fund will cause irreparable injury to the appellant, impair the contractual obligations with the bondholders, violate appellant's rights as a property holder and taxpayer, and that the amount involved exceeds the sum of $3, 000, exclusive of interest and costs. The prayer is that appellees be enjoined from paying the contractor and from paying out the money on any contract not let according to law.\n Appellant applied for a temporary injunction. In support of its application it filed an affidavit of its attorney, stating that the location of the Hammond-New Orleans highway according to law would enhance the property of appellant more than $5,000, and that the exhaustion of the fund would damage appellant in a sum exceeding $5,000. It also filed an affidavit of a resident of the parish of Jefferson, stating that appellant is the owner of 1,400 acres of land situated in the Fourth drainage district of that parish, and that the drainage tax for the district is $3. 50 an acre per year in addition to other taxes.\n It is not alleged that the appellant or its property has been or will be subjected to any tax to pay the bonds, or to pay any part of the cost of the highway, or that it is the holder of any of the bonds, or that the construction of the highway on the route designated in the contracts will damage its property. The attorney's affidavit does not strengthen the naked conclusion alleged in the complaint. \n\n[264 U.S. 308, 310]\n\u00a0\n The statements in the other affidavit have no relevancy to the question of jurisdiction.\n It must appear on the face of the complaint or otherwise from the proofs that the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000.

The mere assertion that more than the required amount is involved is not enough where, as in this case, the facts alleged do not even tend to support the claim. There is nothing to indicate that the matter sought to be enjoined would be of any pecuniary detriment to the appellant or would in any way detract from the value of its property. Indeed, it affirmatively appears that the requisite amount or value is not involved. See Lion Bonding Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 86\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 480.

The information avers that the bank was organized under the laws of the United States and was and is engaged in a general banking business in that city at a banking house, the location of which is given; that, in contravention of its charter and of the act of Congress under which it was incorporated, it has illegally opened and is operating a branch bank for doing a general banking business in a separate building several blocks from its banking house, and proposes to open additional branch banks at various other locations; and that this is in violation of a statute of the state expressly prohibiting the establishment of branch banks. The prayer is that, upon final hearing, the bank be ousted from the privilege of operating this branch bank or any other. A demurrer to the information was interposed and the cause thereupon submitted. The contention of the state was upheld and judgment rendered in accordance with the prayer. 249 S. W. 619.\n The correctness of the judgment is challenged under numerous specifications of error presenting federal questions, which, for the purposes of the case, may be considered under two heads: (1) Whether the state statute is valid as applied to national banks; and (2) whether a proceeding to call a national bank to account for acts of the kind here alleged may be maintained by the state, and whether the form of remedy pursued is sustainable.\n First. The Missouri statute ( 11737, R. S. Mo., 1919) provides 'that no bank shall maintain in this state a branch bank or receive deposits or pay checks except in its own banking house.' That the facts alleged in the information \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 656]\n\u00a0\n bring the case within that part of the statute which prohibits the maintenance of branch banks and that the statute applies to national banks is conclusively established by the decision of the state court, and we confine ourselves to the inqury whether, as thus applied, the statute is valid.\n National banks are brought into existence under federal legislation, are instrumentalities of the federal government and are necessarily subject to the paramount authority of the United States. Nevertheless, national banks are subject to the laws of a state in respect of their affairs, unless such laws interfere with the purposes of their creation, tend to impair or destroy their efficiency as federal agencies, or conflict with the paramount law of the United States. National Bank v. Commonwealth, 9 Wall. 353, 362; Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275, 283\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 502. These two cases are cited and followed in the later case of McClellan v. Chipman, \n164 \nU.S. 347, 357\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 85, 87 (41 L. Ed. 461) and the principle which they establish is said to contain a rule and an exception-'the rule being the operation of general state laws upon the dealings and contracts of national banks; the exception being the cessation of the operation of such laws whenever they expressly conflict with the laws of the United States or frustrate the purpose for which the national banks were created, or impair their efficiency to discharge the duties imposed upon them by the law of the United States.' See, also, Waite v. Dowley, \n94 U.S. 527\n, 533. The question is whether the Missouri statute falls within the rule or within the exception.\n Does it conflict with the laws of the United States? In our opinion, it does not. The extent of the powers of national banks is to be measured by the terms of the federal statutes relating to such associations, and they can rightfully exercise only such as are expressly granted or such incidental powers as are necessary to carry on the business for which they are established. Bullard v. Bank, 18 \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 657]\n\u00a0\n Wall. 589, 593; Logan County Bank v. Townsend, \n139 \nU.S. 67, 73\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 496; California Bank v. Kennedy, \n167 U.S. 362\n. 366, 17 Sup. Ct. 831. Among other things the federal law (R. S.  5134 [Comp. St.  9659]) provides that the organization certificate of the association shall specifically state 'the place where its operations of discount and deposit are to be carried on, designating the state, territory, or district, and the particular county and city, town, or village.' By another provision (R. S.  5190 [Comp. St.  9744]) it is required that 'the usual business of each national banking association shall be transacted at an office or banking house located in the place specified in its organization certificate.' Strictly, the latter provision, employing, as it does, the article 'an' to qualify words in the singular number, would confine the association to one office or banking house. We are asked, however, to construe it otherwise in view of the rule that 'words importing the singular number may extend and be applied to several persons or things.' R. S.  1 (Comp. St.  1). But obviously this rule is not one to be applied except where it is necessary to carry out the evident intent of the statute. See Garrigus v. Board of Commissioners, 39 Ind. 66, 70; Moynahan v. City of New York, 205 N. Y. 181, 186, 98 N. E. 482. Here there is not only nothing in the context or in the subject- matter to require the construction contended for, but other provisions of the national banking laws are persuasively to the contrary. By section 5138, R. S. (Comp. St.  9675), the minimum amount of capital is fixed in proportion to the population of the place where the bank is located. If it had been intended to allow the establishment by an association of not one bank only, but, in addition, as many branch banks as it saw fit, it is remarkable, to say the least, that there should have been no provision for adjusting the capital to the latter contingency or for determining how or under what circumstances such branch banks might be established or for regulating them. Section 5155, R. S. (Comp. St.  9695), provides that it shall be lawful for a state \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 658]\n\u00a0\n bank 'having branches, the capital being joint and assigned to and used by the mother-bank and branches in definite proportions, to become a national banking association ... and to retain and keep in operation its branches , ... the amount of the circulation ... to be regulated by the amount of capital assigned to and used by each.' This provision, confined by its terms, as it is, to existing state institutions, may be fairly considered as constituting an exception to the general rule, and the presence of safeguarding limitations in the excepted case, with their entire absence from the statute otherwise, goes far in the direction of confirming the conclusion that the general rule does not contemplate the establishment of branch banks. This apparently was the interpretation of Congress itself, since in two instances at least special legislation was deemed necessary to allow the establishment of branch banks, viz. at the Chicago Exposition, in 1892 (chapter 71, 27 Stat. 33), and at the St. Louis Exposition, in 1901 (chapter 864, 31 Stat. 1444,  21); the existence of the branch bank in each instance being expressly limited to the period of two years.\n The construction of the executive officers charged with the administration of the law has been, with substantial uniformity, to the same effect, and in this view the Department of Justice, in a well- considered opinion, rendered May 11, 1911, concurred. Lowry National Bank- Establishment of Branches, 29 Op. Atty. Gen. 81.1\n This interpretation of the statute by the legislative department and by the executive officers of the government would go far to remove doubt as to its meaning if any existed. See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 659]\n\u00a0\n 286, 309, 31 Sup. Ct. 578; United States v. Hermanos y Compania, \n209 \nU.S. 337, 339\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 532.\n But it is said that the establishment of a branch bank is the exrcise of an incidental power conferred by section 5136, R. S. (Comp. St.  9661), by which national banking associations are vested with 'all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking.' The mere multiplication of places where the powers of a bank may be exercised is not, in our opinion, a necessary incident of a banking business, within the meaning of this provision. Moreover, the reasons adduced against the existence of the power substantively are conclusive against its existence incidentally; for it is wholly illogical to say that a power which by fair construction of the statutes is found to be denied, nevertheless exists as an incidental power. Certainly, an incidental power can avail neither to create powers which, expressly or by reasonable implication, are withheld nor to enlarge powers given; but only to carry into effect those which are granted.\n Clearly, the state statute, by prohibiting branches, does not frustrate the purpose for which the bank was created or interfere with the discharge of its duties to the government or impair its efficiency as a federal agency. This conclusion would seem to be self-evident, but, if warrant for it be needed, it sufficiently lies in the fact that national banking associations have gone on for more than half a century without branches and upon the theory of an absence of authority to establish them. If the nonexistence of such branches or the absence of power to create them has operated or is calculated to operate to the detriment of the government, or in such manner as to interfere with the efficiency of such associations as federal agencies, or to frustrate their purposes, it is inconceivable that the fact would not long since have been discovered and steps taken by Congress to remedy the omission.\n Second. The state statute as applied to national banks is, therefore, valid, and the corollary that it is obligatory \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 660]\n\u00a0\n and enforceable necessarily results, unless some controlling reason forbids; and, since the sanction behind it is that of the state and not that of the national government, the power of enforcement must rest with the former and not with the latter. To demonstrate the binding quality of a statute, but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law. It is insisted with great earnestness that the United States alone may inquire by quo warranto whether a national bank is acting in excess of its charter powers, and that the state is wholly without authority to do so. This contention will be conceded since it is plainly correct, but the attempt to apply it here proceeds upon a complete misconception of what the state is seeking to do, a misconception which arises from confounding the relief sought with the circumstances relied upon to justify it. The state is neither seeking to enforce a law of the United States nor endeavoring to call the bank to account for an act in excess of its charter powers. What the state is seeking to do is to vindicate and enforce its own law, and the ultimate inquiry which it propounds is whether the bank is violating that law, not whether it is complying with the charter or law of its creation. The latter inquiry is preliminary and collateral, made only for the purpose of determining whether the state law is free to act in the premises or whether its operation is precluded in the particular case by paramount law. Having determined that the power sought to be exercised by the bank finds no justification in any law or authority of the United States, the way is open for the enforcement of the state statute. In other words, the national statutes are interrogated for the sole purpose of ascertaining whether anything they contain constitutes an impediment to the enforcement of the state statute, and the answer being in the negative, they may be laid aside as of no further concern. \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 661]\n\u00a0\n The application of the state statute to the present case and the power of the state to enforce it being established, the nature of the remedy to be employed is a question for state determination, and the judgment of the state court that the one here employed was appropriate is conclusive, unless it involves a denial of due process of law, which plainly it does not. We are not concerned with the question whether an information in the nature of quo warranto, according to the general principles of the law, is in fact appropriate. It is enough that the Supreme Court of the state has so held. Standard Oil Co. v. Missouri, \n224 \nU.S. 270, 287\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 406, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 936; Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 U.S. 78\n, 110-111, 29 Sup. Ct. 14. In Iowa C. R. Co. v. Iowa, \n160 \nU.S. 389, 393\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 344, 354 (40 L. Ed. 467) this court said:\n'But it is clear that the Fourteenth Amendment in no way undertakes to control the power of a state to determine by what process legal rights may be asserted or legal obligations be enforced, provided the method of procedure adopted for these purposes gives reasonable notice and affords fair opportunity to be heard before the issues are decided. This being the case, it was obviously not a right, privilege, or immunity of a citizen of the United States to have a controversy in the state court prosecuted or determined by one form of action instead of by another. ... Whether the court of last resort of the state of Iowa properly construed its own Constitution and laws in determining that the summary process under those laws was applicable to the matter which it adjudged, was purely the decision of a question of state law, binding upon this court.'\n\n See, also, Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Schmidt, \n177 \nU.S. 230, 236\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 620; Hooker v. Los Angeles, \n188 \nU.S. 314, 318\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 395, 47 L. ed. 487, 63 L. R. A. 471; Rogers v. Peck, \n199 \nU.S. 425, 435\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 87.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is therefore\n Affirmed. \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 662]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VANDEVANTER, dissenting:\n I am constrained to dissent from the opinion and judgment just announced.\n National banks are corporate instrumentalities of the United States created under its laws for public purposes essentially national in character and scope. Their powers are derived from the United States, are to be exercised under its supervision, and can be neither enlarged nor restricted by state laws. The decisions uniformly have been to this effect and have proceeded on principles which were settled a century ago in the days of the Bank of the United States.\n In McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, where the status of that bank was drawn in question and elaborately discussed, this court reached the conclusion that the Constitution invests the United States with authority to provide, independently of state laws, for the creation of banking institutions, and their maintenance at suitable points within the states, as a means of carrying into execution its fiscal and other powers. Chief Justice Marshall there dealt with the respective relations of the United States and the states to such an instrumentality in a very plain and convincing way. Among the other things, he said:\n'After the most deliberate consideration, it is the unanimous and decided opinion of this court that the act to incorporate the Bank of the United States is a law made in pursuance of the Constitution, and is a part of the supreme law of the land.' 4 Wheat. 424.\n\n'It is of the very essence of supremacy to remove all obstacles to its action within its own sphere, and so to modify every power vested in subordinate governments, as to exempt its own operations from their own influence. This effect need not be stated in terms. It is so involved in the declaration of supremacy, so necessarily implied in it, that the expression of it could not make it more certain.' 4 Wheat. 427. \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 663]\n\u00a0\n 'The sovereignty of a state extends to everything which exists by its own authority, or is introduced by its permission; but does it extend to those means which are employed by Congress to carry into execution powers conferred on that body by the people of the United States? We think it demonstrable that it does not. Those powers are not given by the people of a single state. They are given by the people of the United States, to a government whose laws, made in pursuance of the Constitution, are declared to be supreme.' 4 Wheat. 429.\n\n In Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738, there was drawn in question the validity of a state statute which, after reciting that the bank had been pursuing its operations contrary to a law of the state, provided that if the operations were continued the bank should be liable to specified exactions, called a tax. The statute was held invalid, the court saying:\n'The bank is not considered as a private corporation, whose principal object is individual trade and individual profit; but as a public corporation, created for public and national purposes. That the mere business of banking is, in its own nature, a private business, and may be carried on by individuals or companies having no political connection with the government, is admitted; but the bank is not such an individual or company. It was not created for its own sake, or for private purposes. ... It is an instrument which is 'necessary and proper' for carrying on the fiscal operations of government.' 9 Wheat. 860, 861.\n\n The later legislation of Congress under which national banks are created and maintained stands on the same constitutional plane. When its validity has been assailed, or its operative force in a state questioned, the cases just mentioned have been regarded as settling the principles to be applied.\n In Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank v. Dearing, \n91 U.S. 29\n, 31, the court referred to those cases, pronounced \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 664]\n\u00a0\n their reasoning applicable to the later legislation, and said:\n'The national banks organized under the act are instruments designed to be used to aid the government in the administration of an important branch of the public service. They are means appropriate to that end. ... Being such means, brought into existence for this purpose, and intended to be so employed, the states can exercise no control over them, nor in any wise affect their operation, except in so far as Congress may see proper to permit. Any thing beyond this is 'an abuse, because it is the usurpation of power which a single state cannot give.\" \n91 U.S. 33\n, 34.\n\n To the same effect are Easton v. Iowa, \n188 \nU.S. 220, 230\n, 237 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 288; Van Reed v. People's National Bank, \n198 \nU.S. 554, 557\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 775, 3 Ann. Cas. 1154; First National Bank v. Union Trust Co., \n244 \nU.S. 416, 425\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 734, L. R. A. 1918C, 283, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1169; and First National Bank v. California, \n262 \nU.S. 366, 369\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 602. Of special pertinence are the following excerpts from Easton v. Iowa:\n'That legislation has in view the erection of a system extending throughout the country, and independent, so far as powers conferred are concerned, of state legislation which, if permitted to be applicable, might impose limitations and restrictions as various and as numerous as the states.' \n188 U.S. 229\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 290.\n\n'It thus appears that Congress has provided a symmetrical and complete scheme for the banks to be organized under the provisions of the statute.\n\n'It is argued by the learned Attorney General on behalf of the state of Iowa that 'the effect of the statute of Iowa is to require of the officers of all banks withing the state a higher degree of diligence in the discharge of their duties. It gives to the general public greater confidence in the stability and solvency of national banks, and in the honesty and integrity of their managing officers. It enables them better to accomplish the purposes and designs \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 665]\n\u00a0\n of the general government, and is an aid, rather than impediment, to their utility and efficiency as agents and instrumentalities of the United States.'\n\n'But we are unable to perceive that Congress intended to leave the field open for the states to attempt to promote the welfare and stability of national banks by direct legislation. If they had such power it would have to be exercised and limited by their own discretion, and confusion would necessarily result from control possessed and exercised by two independent authorities.'\n\n \n188 \nU.S. 231, 232\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 291.\n It must be admitted that, is so far as the legislation of Congress does not provide otherwise, the general laws of a state have the same application to the ordinary transactions of a national bank-such as incurring and discharging obliagtions to depositors, presenting drafts for acceptance or payment and giving notice of their dishonor, taking pledges for the repayment of money loaned, and receiving or making conveyances of real property-that they have to like transactions of others. But not so of questions of corporate power. As explained in Easton v. Iowa and other cases, their solution must turn on the laws of the United States under which the bank is created.\n National banks, like other corporations, have such powers as their creator confers on them, expressly or by fair implication, and none other. Thomas v. West Jersey R. R. Co., \n101 U.S. 71\n, 82; Logan County National Bank v. Townsend, \n139 \nU.S. 67, 73\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 496. Powers not so conferred are in effect denied; a prohibition is implied from the failure to grant them. First National. Bank v. National Exchange Bank, \n92 U.S. 122\n, 128; California National Bank v. Kennedy, \n167 \nU.S. 362, 367\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 831. In short, all the powers of a national bank, like its right to exist at all, have their source in the laws of the United States. Only where those laws bring state laws into the problem, as by enabling national banks to act as executors, administrators, etc., where that is permitted by state laws, can the latter have \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 666]\n\u00a0\n any bearing on the question of corporate power-the privileges which the bank may exercise. First National Bank v. Union Trust Co., \n244 U.S. 416\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 734, L. R. A. 1918C, 283, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1169\n\n\n The proceeding now before us is an information in the nature of quo warranto brought in the Supreme Court of Missouri, whereby that state challenges the power of a national bank in the city of St. Louis to conduct a branch bank established by it in that city and asks that the bank be ousted from that privilege on the grounds, first, that establishing and conducting the branch is a violation of the bank's charter powers, and, secondly, that it is prohibited by a law of the state.\n It is not claimed that the laws of the United States contain any provision whereby the privilege asserted by the bank is made to depend on the will or legislative policy of the state; nor do they in fact contain any such provision. Whether the bank has the privilege which it asserts is therefore in no way dependent on or affected by the state law, but turns exclusively on the laws of the United States. If they grant the privilege, expressly or by fair implication, no law of the state can abridge it or take it away. And if they do not grant it, they in effect prohibit it, and no law of the state can strengthen or weaken the prohibition. In either event nothing can turn on the state law. It simply has no bearing on the solution of the question.\n In this situation the state is not, in my opinion, entitled to maintain the proceeding. It has no distinctive right to protect, nor any applicable law to vindicate or enforce. The proceeding is one which may be maintained only in the public right. Here the state is not authorized to represent or to speak for the public. The bank is not a creation and instrumentality of the state, but of the national government. Its presence in the state is attributable to the national power, not to the state's permission. Whether the bank shall be kept within its legitimate powers and made to discontinue any departure from or abuse \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 667]\n\u00a0\n of them is a matter in which the people of all the states have the same interest, the bank being a national creation and instrumentality. The people of Missouri merely share in the common interest. 'In that field it is the United States, and not the state, which represents them as parens patriae, when such representation becomes appropriate; and to the former, and not to the latter, they must look for such protective measures as flow from that status.' Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n252 \nU.S. 447, 486\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 597, 600 (67 L. Ed. 1078). It therefore is apparent that the state is here mistakenly appropriating to itself a function which belongs to the United States.\n In Tarble's Case, 13 Wall. 397, 407 (20 L. Ed. 597), which possessed features making it particularly pertinent here, this court pointed out the distinct and independent character of the national and state governments, within their respective spheres, and in that connection said:\n'Neither can intrude with its judicial process into the domain of the other, except so far as such intrusion may be necessary on the part of the national government to preserve its rightful supremacy in cases of conflict of authority. In their laws, and mode of enforcement, neither is responsible to the other. How their respective laws shall be enacted; how they shall be carried into execution; and in what tribunals, or by what officers; and how much discretion, or whether any at all shall be vested in their officers- are matters subject to their own control, and in the regulation of which neither can interfere with the other.'\n\n Another case apposite in principle is Territory v. Lockwood, 3 Wall. 236. It was a proceeding in the nature of quo warranto brought by the territory of Nebraska to test the defendant's right to hold a federal office in the territory which he was charged with unlawfully usurping. This court disposed of the matter by saying:\n'The right of the territory to prosecute such an information as this would carry with it the power of amotion \n\n[263 U.S. 640, 668]\n\u00a0\n without the consent of the government from which the appointment was derived. This the territory can no more accomplish in one way than in another. The subject is as much beyond the sphere of its authority as it is beyond the authority of the states as to the federal officers whose duties are to be discharged within their respective limits. The right to institute such proceedings in inherently in the government of the nation.' 3 Wall. 239.\n\n With great deference. I think the judgment below should be reversed on the ground that the state is without capacity to bring or maintain this proceeding, and the court below without authority to entertain it.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BUTLER authorize me to say that they concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Our attention is directed to a later opinion of the Attorney General, dated October 3, 1923, which althoigh in terms a ffirming the earlier opinion, announces a limted rule, which does not seem to be in precise agreement with it. To the extent of the disagrteement, however, we accept the view of the earlier opinion. \n\n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST NAT. BANK v. WELD COUNTY(1924)\nNo. 180\nArgued: Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry N. Haynes, of Greeley, Colo., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Wm. R. Kelly, of Greeley, Colo., and Charles Roach, of Denver, Colo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action to recover the amount of certain taxes levied for the fiscal years 1913 and 1914 and paid under protest. The court below sustained a demurrer to the amended complaint, and, plaintiff electing to stand thereon, entered judgment of dismissal. \n\n[264 U.S. 450, 451]\n\u00a0\n Reversal of the judgment is sought here on the ground that the taxes were assessed and collected in contravention of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and of section 5219, U. S. R. S. (Comp. St.  9784).\n Under the Colorado statute (R. S. Colo. 1908, c. 122) a bank is required to make a list of its shares, stating their market value, and of its shareholders for the information of the county assessor, who is thereupon directed to assess such shares for taxation in all respects the same as similar property belonging to other corporations and individuals. Sections 5754, 5756. If any taxpayer is of the opinion that his property has been assessed too high, or otherwise illegally assessed, he may appear before the assessor and have the same corrected. Section 5639. The county commissioners of each county are constituted a board of equalization, with power to adjust and equalize the assessment among the several taxpayers, with reference to which any dissatisfied taxpayer may be heard. Section 5761\n\n\n The state tax commission, created in 1911, is authorized to supervise the administration of and enforce the tax laws, and exercise supervision over county assessors and boards of equalization, to the end that all assessments be made relatively just and uniform and at their true and full cash value. Comp. Laws Colo. 1921, c. 155,  7334, par. 1. The commission may raise or lower the assessed value of any property, first giving notice to the owner thereof and fixing a time and place for hearing. Id. par. 7. Authority is conferred upon the commission to receive complaints and examine into all cases, where it is alleged that property has been fraudulently, or improperly or unfairly assessed. Section 7336. It shall, on or before the 1st day of October of each year, increase or decrease the valuation of the property in any county by such rate per cent. or such amount as will place the same on the assessment roll at its full and true cash value (section 7352), and must thereupon transmit to the state board of \n\n[264 U.S. 450, 452]\n\u00a0\n equalization a statement of the amount to be added or deducted (section 7353). It then becomes the duty of the state board of equalization to examine the abstracts of assessment submitted by the commission, and certify to the county assessor of each county a record of its action thereon. Section 7354. The commission is required to be in session every day except Sundays, and may hold sessions anywhere in the state. Section 7330.\n The essential averments of the complaint may be shortly stated: Plaintiff made and delivered to the county assessor of Weld county the statement required by law. The assessor thereupon fixed the value of its shares, as well as that of the shares of other banks within the county, at their full cash and market value, but fixed the assessed value of the property of the remaining taxpayers in the county at 61 per cent. for 1913, and 80 per cent. for 1914, of such cash and market value. The county board of equalization accepted this assessment without change. The assessor thereupon transmitted to the tax commission the abstracts required by law. The tax commission determined that the property of the county as a whole had been underassessed, and recommended a horizontal increase of 63 per cent. in 1913 and 25 per cent. in 1914, as necessary to bring it to the full cash value. This determination was approved by the state board of equalization and the county assessor was directed to make the increase, with the result, as alleged, that plaintiff's assets, and those of all other banks in the county, were in fact assessed at an amount 63 per cent. in excess of their value for the year 1913 and 25 per cent. in excess thereof for the year 1914. In other counties of the state, either no increase of valuation was made, or the increase was comparatively small. The result was that the banks of Weld county were assessed and compelled to pay upon a valuation grossly in excess of that put upon other property in the same county, and likewise in excess of that put upon other banks in other \n\n[264 U.S. 450, 453]\n\u00a0\n counties of the state. It does not appear from the complaint that plaintiff applied to any of the taxing authorities to reduce the assessment of its property or correct the alleged inequalities, prior to the final levy of the tax, but some time after such levy had been completed, it made application for abatement and rebate, which application was approved by the county board, but disallowed by the state tax commission.\n We are met at the threshold of our consideration of the case with the contention that the plaintiff did not exhaust its remedies before the administrative boards, and consequently cannot be heard by a judicial tribunal to assert the invalidity of the tax. We are of opinion that this contention must be upheld.\n The Supreme Court of Colorado, in a suit brought by this plaintiff against the county assessor, involving the same tax for 1913, and presenting the same questions here involved, sustained the refusal of a lower court to enjoin the collection of the tax, and held: (a) That the flat increase made by the tax commission was in strict conformity with the state statutes; (b) that this action, being approved by the state board of equalization, constituted a final assessment; (c) that under the statute the plaintiff was bound to know the authority of these taxing agencies in the premises, and that they were required to meet at certain places, on certain days, and complete their labors within designated dates; and (d) 'with full knowledge of the respective powers of these several boards to make corrections in assessments and adjustments in equalization, essential to bring about a complete and equitable assessment of all property within the state, it remained inactive until long after the tax was laid, when it applied for an abatement or rebate of the tax. The aforesaid tribunals were open to plaintiff in error prior to the laying of the tax, but it refrained from seeking relief therein, and may not now complain.' First National Bank v. Patterson, 65 Colo. 166, 172, 173, 176 Pac. 498, 501. \n\n[264 U.S. 450, 454]\n\u00a0\n The effect of this is to hold that an administrative remedy was in fact open to plaintiff under the statutes of the state, and by this construction, upon well settled principles, we are bound. McGregor v. Hogan, \n263 U.S. 234\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 50, 68 L. Ed. --, decided November 12, 1923; Farncomb v. Denver, \n252 \nU.S. 7, 10\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 271; Londoner v.

Ct. 730.\n Plaintiff seeks to excuse its failure to apply to the county board for an equalization by saying that this was a public duty of the board and not a private remedy; and Greene v. Louisville & I. R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 449, 521\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88, is relied upon as authority. The most cursory examination of that case, however, will disclose its inapplicability. There the divergent assessments were made by two assessing boards, neither having control or supervision of the other; and it was held that complainants, whose property had been assessed by one of these boards, were not entitled, under the Kentucky statutes, to complain to the other board that its assessments were too low. A very different question is presented here, where the same board has affirmed both assessments, is expressly vested by statute with the power of equalization, and may exert its power at the instance of anyone aggrieved. Hallett v. County Commissioners, 27 Colo. 86, 93, 59 Pac. 733; Barnett v. Jaynes, 26 Colo. 279, 282, 57 Pac. 703.\n It is urged, further, that it would have been futile to seek a hearing before the state tax commission, because, first, no appeal to a judicial tribunal was provided in the event of a rejection of a taxpayer's complaint; and, second, because the time at the disposal of the commission for hearing individual complaints was inadequate. But, aside from the fact that such an appeal is not a matter of right but wholly dependent upon statute (2 Cooley on Taxation [3d Ed.] p. 1393), we cannot assume that, if application had been made to the commission, proper relief \n\n[264 U.S. 450, 455]\n\u00a0\n would not have been accorded by that body, in view of its statutory authority to receive complaints and examine into all cases where it is alleged that property has been fraudulently, improperly, or unfairly assessed. Collins v. City of Keokuk, 118 Iowa, 30, 35, 91 N. W. 791. Nor will plaintiff be heard to say that there was not adequate time for a hearing, in the absence of any effort on its part to obtain one. In any event, the decision of the state Supreme Court in the Patterson Case, that such remedies were in fact available, is controlling here.\n It is contended, however, that the decision in that case turns upon the point that plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law, and not that it had lost its right by neglecting to seek an administrative remedy. It is true the court, after the statement quoted above, proceeds to say that plaintiff cannot have relief in equity; but this seems to be put forth as an independent ground for affirming the judgment below. It follows the unqualified statement that plaintiff, having refrained from seeking the administrative relief open to it, 'may not now complain,' and is introduced by the words (page 174 [176 Pac. 501]):\n'But apart from this, if the tax was not legally laid, plaintiff in error could, upon payment thereof, recover the same from the county under the provisions of section 5750, R. S. 1908.'\n\n It is not suggested that in so doing the requirement, already broadly recognized, that administrative remedies must be exhausted as a necessary prerequisite to a judicial challenge of the tax, could be dispensed with; and, accepting the decision of the state court that such remedies were, in fact, open and available under the Colorado statutes, it could not be dispensed with.

The judgment of the District Court is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFLEMING v. FLEMING(1924)\nNo. 175\nArgued: January 17, 1924Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 29, 30]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. B. I. Salinger, of Carroll, Iowa, and Albert B. Cummins and Clinton L. Nourse, both of Des Moines, Iowa, for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. J. M. Parsons and Guy A. Miller, both of Des Moines, Iowa, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Iowa. The suit was begun in Polk county district court by Anna B. Fleming, widow of Charles Fleming, against three brothers of her husband, one of whom had become his administrator, to secure her dower rights under the state statute in the share of her husband in the property of a partnership of the four brothers in the business of soliciting and placing life insurance. The defendants' claim was that Charles lost all interest in the partnership upon his death, that by virtue of three contracts the property passed to the survivors, and the partnership of the three continued in possession and title free from any claim by heirs, next of kin, or the widow of Charles. The Supreme Court of Iowa held that these contracts constituted a contract by each partner to make a will to his survivors, were testamentary in character, and were avoided by section 3376 of the Code of Iowa, providing that as between husband and wife the survivor's share cannot be affected by any will of the spouse without previous consent of the survivor. \n\n[264 U.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n It is assigned for error that in this ruling the Supreme Court of the state reversed its former rulings, under which such a contract of partnership had been held to be valid, and not avoided by section 3376 or any other section of the Code, that on the faith of these rulings the partnership contracts herein had been entered into, and that the new construction of the statute was an impairment of the contracts of partnership in violation of article 1,  10, of the federal Constitution. This objection was made in the Supreme Court of the state on the application for a second rehearing, and the court held in its opinion that the point was not well taken, because no prior decisions had in fact been overruled. This is a sufficient consideration of the point by the state Supreme Court before its judgment to justify an assignment of error raising the federal question if in fact and in law it be one.\n In Tidal Oil Co. v. Flanagan, \n263 U.S. 444\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 197, 68 L. Ed. --, decided January 7, 1924, we had occasion to consider the same issue. After a somewhat full examination, we held that by a score of decisions of this court a judicial impairment of a contract obligation was not within section 10, art. 1, of the Constitution, since the inhibition was directed only against impairment by legislation, and that such judicial action presented no federal question of which this court could take jurisdiction on a writ of error from a state court.\n It is urged upon us that the impairment here is legislative, in that the case turned on the effect of section 3376 of the Iowa Code; that the subsequent judicial construction of it became part of the statute and gave it a new effect as a law. In other words, the contention is that the same statute was one law when first construed before the making of the contract and has become a new and different act of the Legislature by the later decision of the court. This is ingenious but unsound. It is the same law. The effect of the subsequent decisions is not to make a new law, but only to hold that the law always meant what the court \n\n[264 U.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n now says it means. The court has power to construe a legislative act, but it has no power by change in construction to date its passage as a law from the time of the later decision. A statute in force when a contract was made cannot be made a subsequent statute through new interpretation by the courts. Any different view would be at variance with the many decisions of this court cited in the Flanagan Case.\n For these reasons, we must hold that the claim of plaintiffs in error does not raise a substantial federal question, and dismiss the writ of error for lack of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGERDES v. LUSTGARTEN(1924)\nNo. 70\nArgued: Decided: November 24, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 321, 322]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Moses Cohen, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Lawrence J. Bershad, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Lustgarten, the respondent, was adjudged bankrupt in an involuntary proceeding in the Southern District of New York. He duly filed an application for discharge. Two creditors filed objections, specifying four grounds of opposition,1 which were referred to the referee. \n2\n Thereupon an order was made directing the trustee to prosecute the specifications at the expense of the estate.\n Only two of them are here involved: One alleging that Lustgarten had failed to keep proper books of account, and the other, that he had obtained credit from the Corn Exchange Bank, an objecting creditor, upon a false statement in writing.\n Section 14b of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 412, 36 Stat. 838 (Comp. St.  9598), provides that the judge, on hearing a bankrupt's application for discharge \n\n[266 U.S. 321, 323]\n\u00a0\n and the pleas and proofs made in opposition thereto, shall 'discharge the applicant unless he has ... (2) with intent to conceal his financial condition ... failed to keep books of account or records from which such condition might be ascertained; or (3) obtained money or property on credit upon a materially false statement in writing, made by him to any person or his representative for the purpose of obtaining credit from such person. ...'\n No evidence was introduced before the referee under the specification of opposition relating to the books of account. As to the obtaining of credit, it was shown that on January 6, 1920, Lustgarten gave the Bank a signed statement setting forth his financial condition on December 15, 1919, and showing a net worth of more than $58,000. This statement recited that it was made 'for the purpose of obtaining loans,' and stated that: 'This statement is to be regarded by Abraham Lustgarten and by The Corn Exchange Bank as continuous and binding, and to form a true statement as to the assets and liabilities of the undersigned, and other matters, to be relied upon by The Corn Exchange Bank upon application by the undersigned, for all loans until another statement in writing shall be substituted for this, or this statement recalled. ... And further, whenever my financial condition is changed materially from the financial condition shown in the above statement, I agree to notify the said Bank at once of such change, whether applications for further loans are made or not.' There was conflicting evidence as to whether or not the statement as to Lustgarten's financial condition was materially false. In October and November, 1920, and February, 1921, the Bank, on his applications, made him three loans, aggregating $11, 000. He had meanwhile given the Bank no notice of any change in his financial condition; and there was no evidence that it had in fact substantially changed. \n\n[266 U.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n The referee reported that, without deciding the 'difficult' question of fact whether Lustgarten's statement to the Bank was false when given, and assuming that the Bank had relied upon it in extending the credits, he was of opinion that it had no right so to do, since in view of the financial depression prevailing in 1920, the 'reasonable time' for which the statement remained a 'continuing statement' had expired when the credits were extended; and he recommended that the discharge be granted.\n The District Court, at a hearing on the referee's report-apparently assuming, but not deciding, that the financial statement was false and that the Bank had relied upon it-held that as the statement was a continuing one and provided for notice of any material changes, the Bank had a right to rely upon it until such notice was given. The court also considered the specification relating to the books of account,3 and upon the evidence that had been taken before the referee upon a closely related specification not here involved,4 held that the fact that the books did not show an indebtedness which Lustgarten claimed to have owed his nephew, constituted a failure to keep proper books and that the intent to conceal his financial condition was reasonably to be inferred. The discharge was accordingly denied.\n On an appeal by Lustgarten from this order, the Circuit Court of Appeals-without passing upon the question whether the financial statement was false, and expressing doubt whether on the testimony it could be said that the Bank had relied upon it-held that, in any event, on account of the lapse of time between the making of the statement and the obtaining of the loans and the general \n\n[266 U.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n financial conditions then prevailing, the Bank 'was not justified in relying upon the statement,'5 And on the testimony relating to the books of account, the court found that the failure to make entries showing the indebtedness to Lustgarten's nephew was due to inadvertent and faulty bookkeeping and 'not to any intent to conceal financial conditions.' The order of the District Court was accordingly reversed, with instructions to grant the discharge. In re Lustgarten, 289 F. 481. Thereafter this writ of certiorari was granted the trustee. Gerdes v. Lustgarten, \n262 \nU.S. 741\n, 43 S. Ct. 705\n\n\n 1. On the question of the continuing effect of a false financial statement, there is a conflict of opinion between the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and those for the Third and Fifth Circuits. In Ragan v. Cotton (5th Circ.) 200 F. 546, 550, 118 C. C. A. 640, it was held that where a bankrupt had made a false financial statement for the purpose of obtaining credit, which provided that it should be binding for continuing credit unless changed, and a creditor had relied upon such false statement in extending credits for purchases made from nine to twelve months thereafter, the discharge should be denied. And in Haimowich v. Mandel (3d Circ.) 243 F. 338, 342, 156 C. C. A. 118, 122, it was held that where a bankrupt had made a false financial statement as a basis for obtaining credit, and seven months thereafter, within the time in which the bankrupt 'intended the statement to serve that end,' creditors had been induced by its falsity to extend credit to him, the discharge was barred. There the court said that the test whether a false statement given upon one date and acted upon at a later date, operates as a bar to a discharge, is 'whether at that time the false statement was still in force and binding upon the bankrupt, to be determined \n\n[266 U.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n according as it is found that the sale on credit was or was not the proximate result of the statement ... and that its original falsity was or was not the thing that worked the mischief.'\n We think that these two cases embody, in substance, the rule that should be here applied. Under the Bankruptcy Act the discharge is to be denied if it is shown that the bankrupt 'obtained money or property on credit upon a materially false statement in writing, made by him ... for the purpose of obtaining credit.' The only essentials to the statutory bar, in so far as relates to the present question, are: (a) That the written statement was made for the purpose of obtaining credit; (b) that it was materially false; and (c) that the credit was obtained upon it. If these are established the vice inherent in the original falsity of the statement is not remedied by the lapse of time; and if the creditor extends credit upon such a false statement while it is still in force and binding upon the bankrupt, within the time in which he intended it should serve that end, it does not lie in his mouth to say that by reason of extrinsic circumstances the creditor was not justified in relying upon it. In short, the lapse of time is only material in determining whether credit was extended within the period intended, while the statement was still binding on the bankrupt, and whether the creditor in fact extended the credit upon the faith of the statement. Here Lustgarten's statement expressly recited that it was made 'for the purpose of obtaining loans' from the Bank, and that it should be regarded by himself and the Bank as 'continuous and binding' and relied on by the Bank 'for all loans' until changed or recalled. Lustgarten applied for the loans in question without either changing or recalling the statement. And it is entirely clear that the loans were made while the statement was still binding upon him and serving the end which he intended, as shown both by its \n\n[266 U.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n plain and unambiguous provisions and by his own conduct in pursuance thereof.\n We therefore conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error in holding that, irrespective of the questions of the falsity of the statement and the reliance of the Bank upon it, the discharge should be granted upon the theory that the Bank was not justified in relying upon it when the credits were extended; and that if the statement when made was materially false and the Bank made the loans in reliance upon it, the discharge should have been denied.\n\n 2. \nAn examination of the evidence in reference to the books of account discloses no error in the finding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that Lustgarten's failure to make the entries of the indebtedness to his nephew was not due to any intent to conceal his financial condition; and, on the contrary, leads us to the conclusion that this finding is in accordance with the greater weight of the evidence. Under the Bankruptcy Act, however, such intent must be shown in order to bar the discharge.\n\n 3. \nThe question then arises as to what disposition we should now make of the case. The material questions of fact in reference to the financial statement, upon which the decision must ultimately depend, have not as yet been determined in the courts below. They were not decided by the referee who heard the testimony; they were apparently assumed by the District Court; and they were not passed upon by the Circuit Court of Appeals on account of its ruling in reference to the lapse of time. We may now either determine these questions upon an independent examination of the testimony, or remand the case for further proceedings in order that they may be determined in the lower courts. Cole v. Ralph, \n252 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 40 S. Ct. 321. If they had been specifically decided by the District Court and only the Circuit Court of Appeals had failed to pass upon them, an appropriate course would be \n\n[266 U.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n to remand the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Lutcher Lumber Co. v. Knight, \n217 \nU.S. 257, 268\n, 30 S. Ct. 505; Brown v. Fletcher, \n237 \nU.S. 583, 588\n, 35 S. Ct. 750. But since they were not expressly decided by the District Court, we conclude that, under all the circumstances, we should take the course adopted in Marconi Wireless Co. v. Simon, \n246 \nU.S. 46, 57\n, 38 S. Ct. 275, that is, reverse the decrees in both the courts below and remand the case to the District Court. If it be determined that the financial statement was materially false and that the Bank made the loans in reliance upon it, the discharge should be denied; otherwise it should be granted.\n The decrees of the District Court and of the Circuit Court of Appeals are accordingly reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Gen.

The bankruptcy court found that the firm was composed of Marcuse, Morris, Hecht, Finn, Vette, Zuncker, Regensteiner, Clement Studebaker, Jr., and George M. Studebaker, and sent the case to the referee, directing findings of fact as to insolvency. The case was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals on petition to review and revise that finding and order. That court eliminated from the order the names of all except Marcuse and Morris. Vette v. Giles, 281 Fed. 928. This court granted a writ of certiorari on petition of creditors. \n260 U.S. 712\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 14. The question for decidsion is whether any of the persons named, other than Marcuse and Morris, are liable as general partners. \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 555]\n\u00a0\n Marcuse had been a member, and Morris had been an employee, of the firm of Von Frantzius & Co., brokers, at Chicago, which suspended business because of the death of Von Frantzius. In April, 1917, settlement of the estate of Von Frantzius was pending in probate court. Proceedings in bankruptcy were pending against Von Frantzius & Co. There were many creditors of the firm, and it was indebted in large amounts to the respondents other than Vette and Zuncker. Marcuse desired to organize a new brokerage firm to carry on business in the place formerly occupied by his old firm. It was proposed that a limited partnership be formed under the Illinois Limited Partnership Act of 1874 (Rev. St. 1874, c. 84,  1- 23), and to that end a form of agreement was prepared, and nine originals were signed by Marcuse, Morris, Hecht, Finn, Vette, Zuncker, Regensteiner, and Hoffman (in his own name, but in fact representing the Studebaker interest).\n In advance of the consummation of this agreement, Marcuse was to arrange with creditors of the firm that the assets of the Von Frantzius estate be turned over to him, as trustee, on his giving bond and making certain payments for the protection of the administrators. He was to obtain assignments of the claims of creditors, in consideration of trust certificates issued by him containing his agreement to pay off the creditors who did not accept such certificates, to organize a new partnership, to turn over the assets to the new firm for liquidation in the usual course of its business for account of the certificate holders, and, out of profits accruing to him as a member of the new firm, to pay any deficiency remaining after liquidation of the assets. This arrangement had not been completed at the time of the signing of the partnership agreement. The signed agreements were placed in escrow, not to be delivered until conclusion of arrangements for the delivery to Marcuse of all \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 556]\n\u00a0\n the assets of Von Frantzius, excepting an amount to indemnify against claims of nonassenting creditors, and to pay the expenses of administration, and until dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings.\n The proposed agreement provided for a limited copartnership under the name of Marcuse & Co., to commence business on April 2, 1917, and to continue for five years. Marcuse and Morris were to be general partners. The other signers were to be limited partners. Marcuse was to contribute a membership in the New York Stock Exchange, in addition to cash and other property. Morris was to contribute $10,000. Contributions were to be made by the limited partners as follows: Hecht $25,000, Finn $31,500, Vette $30, 000, Zuncker $25,000, Regensteiner $28,500, and Hoffman (in fact the Studebaker interest) $50,000-amounting in all to $190,000. The general partners were to devote all their time to the business and were permitted to draw specified sums each year to be charged to expenses. Each partner, general and limited, was to have 6 per cent. on capital contributed by him. Morris was to have 10 per cent. of the net profits. There was to be paid to Marcuse 25 per cent. of the net profits, to be used by him to pay off his trust certificates covering the debts of Von Frantzius & Co. The rest was to be divided among the partners, except Morris, in the proportions in which they had contributed capital.\n Shortly after the deposit in escrow, Marcuse learned that the New York Stock Exchange would not admit to membership a firm having more than two limited partners, but would not object to a firm having only two limited partners, who were not engaged in other business. This was reported to the others, and the matter of consummating the proposed partnership agreement was dropped.\n But Marcuse did not abandon the idea of organizing a new firm, and, after conferences and lapse of some time, \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 557]\n\u00a0\n another limited partnership agreement for a firm of the same name was prepared conformably to the act of 1874. Marcuse, Morris, Hecht, and Finn were the parties to the new agreement. It was dated-as was the former- April 2, 1917, and was signed June 30 of that year. Marcuse and Morris were general partners and agreed to contribute capital as in the proposed former agreement. Hecht and Finn were named as limited partners, and each agreed to contribute $95,000. The liability of each was expressly limited to the amount contributed by him. The term was five years from July 1, 1917. Rights, duties, and immunities of the general and limited partners were substantially as stated in the first draft.\n On the same day, and as a part of the same transaction, there was signed an instrument known as the Hecht-Finn trust agreement. The limited partnership agreement was made a part of it, and a copy was attached. It recited that Hecht and Finn would be entitled to certain payments and distributions of income and assets of the copartnership, and declared that they held the same as trustees. The agreement directed payment to the Chicago Title & Trust Company of all funds at any time payable to Hecht and Finn under the partnership agreement, or by way of distribution or dissolution. It directed the trust company to distribute all funds to the holders of certain trust certificates for 380 shares of the initial value of $500 per share to be issued by Hecht and Finn, in accordance with the agreement, as follows: To Hecht 50 shares, Finn 63 Shares, Vette 60 shares, Zuncker 50 shares, Regensteiner 57 shares, and Hoffman (for the Studebaker interest) 100 shares. Certificate holders were entitled to have access to the books, to have an inventory and account once a year, and a trial balance monthly. Hecht and Finn were to appoint such auditors as the holders of certificates should designate. On the report of the auditors and the direction of the certificate holders, \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 558]\n\u00a0\n they were authorized to take steps to dissolve the firm, if the business was not conducted conservatively or was neglected or mismanaged. It was provided that the certificate holders should 'have no right, title or interest, directory, proprietary or otherwise, in the said copartnership or in or to the property or assets of said copartnership, ...' and that 'the interest of each ... holder of trust certificates shall consist solely of the right to receive his proportionate share of the net part or parts of the trust fund from time to time payable to the trust company hereunder, ...' This agreement was signed by Hecht and Finn; there was attached to it an agreement signed by Marcuse, Morris, Hecht, and Finn to do all things necessary to carry out the trust, and the trust company accepted the duties imposed upon it.\n On the same day-June 30, 1917-Hecht delivered his check to Marcuse & Co. for $25,000 and Finn his check for $31,500, and checks were delivered to Hecht and Finn by Vette for $30,000, by Zuncker for $25,000, by Regensteiner for $28,500, and by Hoffman (for the Studebaker interest) for $ 50,000. These checks were handed over to Marcuse & Co., making up a total of $190,000.\n On Monday, July 2, the certificate of limited partnership was filed in the office of the county clerk. The new firm commenced business on that day. All the letter heads and other papers of the firm indicated that Marcuse and Morris were general partners and that Hecht and Finn were limited partners. Hecht and Finn took no part in the control of the business. Marcuse and Morris exercised exclusive control and carried on the business. The Hecht-Finn trust agreement was unknown to persons dealing with the firm. It does not appear that any of the creditors understood or had any reason to believe that the arrangement was other than as shown by the partnership agreement. \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 559]\n\u00a0\n From time to time, while it was a going concern, the firm paid dividends on the capital contributed. After bankruptcy proceedings had been commenced against Marcuse & Co., Hecht and Finn, in accordance with section 11 of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (Hurd's Rev. St. Ill. 1919, c. 106a,  55), hereafter quoted, renounced their interest in the profits of the business or other compensation by way of income. They also paid $46,000 into court for the benefit of the alleged bankrupt estate. This amount was sufficient to cover all dividends paid on the $190,000, so contributed to the capital of the business, with interest on such dividends from the times of payment.\n Are Hecht and Finn liable as general partners?\n No limited partnership was formed. On July 1, 1917, the Illinois Limited Partnership Act of 1874 was repealed, and there was substituted for it the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (Hurd's Revised Statutes 1919, c. 106a,  45-75). The Uniform (General) Partnership Act (Id.  1-45) became effective on the same day. The act of 1874 provided that no limited partnership should be deemed to have been formed until the certificate should be filed in the office of the county clerk. The first effort to form a limited partnership was given up. The final effort failed because the certificate was not filed until after the repeal of the act of 1874. Limited partnerships organized under the act of 1917 are not authorized to do a brokerage business, and no attempt was made to organize under it.\n Hecht and Finn were not partners as to Marcuse and Morris. It is well settled in Illinois that, as between the parties, the question of partnership is one of intention, to be gathered from the facts and circumstances. Goacher v. Bates, 280 Ill. 372, 376, 117 N. E. 427; National Surety Co. v. Townsend Brick Co., 176 Ill. 156, 161, 52 N. E. 938; Grinton v. Strong, 148 Ill. 587, 596, 36 N. E. 559; Lycoming Insurance Co. v. Barringer, 73 Ill. 230, 233, 234; Smith v. Knight, 71 Ill. \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 560]\n\u00a0\n 148, 150, 22 Am. Rep. 94. See, also, London Assurance Co. v. Drennen, \n116 \nU.S. 461, 472\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 442. The Uniform (General) Partnership Act provides:\n'A partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.' Section 6(1).\n\n'... Persons who are not partners as to each other are not partners as to third persons.' Section 7(1).\n\n'... Common property or part ownership does not of itself establish a partnership, whether such co-owners do or do not share any profits made by the use of the property.' Section 7(2).\n\n'The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business. ...' Section 7(4).\n\n Hecht and Finn did not carry on the business of the firm as co-owners or otherwise. They had no authority, actual or apparent, to act for or bind the copartnership. The agreements of the parties, their subsequent conduct, the repayment of dividends received, with interest, together with the other facts and circumstances above alluded to, are more than sufficient to rebut and overcome any inference legitimately resulting from the receipt of a share of the profits. The provisions of the agreement giving respondents right to have access to the books of the firm, to have statements, to appoint auditors, and, in the events specified, to call for a dissolution, were appropriate in a limited partnership. See section 19, Act of 1874; section 10, Uniform Limited Partnership Act. Under the circumstances, these provisions do not indicate any intent on the part of Hecht and Finn to become general partners, or support petitioners' contention that they are liable as partners.\n As to third parties, they cannot be held liable as general partners.\n Section 16 of the Uniform (General) Partnership Act provides that:\n'When a person ... represents himself, or consents to another representing him to any one, \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 561]\n\u00a0\n as a parther in an existing partnership, ... he is liable to any such person ... who has, on the faith of such representation, given credit to the actual or apparent partnership, and if he has made such representation or consented to its being made in a public manner he is liable. ...'\n\n There was no such representation of Hecht or Finn to any person or to the public. On the contrary, they were published to the world as limited partners. It is true that they were not. But no person could have been misled to his disadvantage by the statement that they were. Representation on mistaken belief that they were limited partners was not a holding out as general partners. The lack of power of a limited partnership created under the later act to carry on a brokerage business gives no additional significance to the representations. The firm was not held out as having been organized under that act. The failure to complete the organization did not injure any persons dealing with the firm. Creditors are as well off as if the limited partnership had been perfected. The $190,000 handed over by Hecht and Finn was not withdrawn. Hecht and Finn did not intend or agree to become general partners. The things intended and done do not constitute a partnership. They did nothing to estop them from denying liability as such. The case is not doubtful. But if it were, their intent should be followed. Beecher v. Bush, 45 Mich. 188, 193, 7 N. W. 785, 40 Am. Rep. 465. See also Post v. Kimberly, 9 Johns. 470, 502, et seq. To hold them liable as general partners would give creditors what they are not entitled to have, and would impose on Hecht and Finn burdens that are not theirs to bear.\n Moreover, we think that section 11 of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act was applicable, and was properly invoked by Hecht and Finn. It provides:\n'A person who has contributed to the capital of a business conducted by a person or partnership erroneously believing that he has become a limited partner in a limited partnership, is not, by reason of his exercise of the rights \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 562]\n\u00a0\n of a limited partner, a general partner with the person or in the partnership carrying on the business, or bound by the obligations of such person or partnership; provided that on ascertaining the mistake he promptly renounces his interest in the profits of the business, or other compensation by way of income.'\n\n Prior to the taking effect of that act, the courts of Illinois held that at common law all partners were liable without limitation for the debts of the firm, and that, in order to limit such liability, the statute authorizing limited partnerships must be complied with, or all those who associated under it would be liable as general partners. Henkel v. Heyman, 91 Ill. 96, 101; Manhattan Brass Co. v. Allin, 35 Ill. App. 336, 341; Walker v. Wood, 69 Ill. App. 542, 549, affirmed 170 Ill. 463, 48 N. E. 919; Cummings v. Hayes, 100 Ill. App. 347, 353. And this is in harmony with decisions elsewhere under statutes similar to the Illinois act of 1874.1 These cases illustrate how strictly the common-law rule against limitation of liability was applied, and how far the doctrine of constructive partnership was carried. It was thought that the strictness of the old act and decisions under it impaired the usefulness of limited partnerships as business organizations because of the risk that one contributing capital as a limited partner might be held liable without limitation. \n2\n The Uniform Limited \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 563]\n\u00a0\n Partnership Act and the Uniform (General) Partnership Act, passed at the same time, relax the strictness of the rules against limitation of liability. Each provides that the rule that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed shall have no application to it, and that the act shall be so interpreted and construed as to effect the general purpose to make uniform the laws of those states which adopt it. See section 28, Uniform Limited Partnership Act (Hurd's Rev. St. 1919, c. 106a,  72); section 4, Uniform (General) Partnership Act.\n Hecht and Finn contributed to the capital of the business, and each erroneously believed that he had become a limited partner in a limited partnership. Neither took any part in the control of the business or exercised any rights or powers in respect of it, other than those which might belong to one not a general partner. See section 19, Act of 1874; section 10, Uniform Limited Partnership Act. They made the renunciation provided for. No person suffered any loss or disadvantage because it was not made earlier, or because of reliance on any statement in the certificate. All dividends paid on the $190,000 were returned. It need not be decided whether such return was necessary.\n Section 11 is broad and highly remedial. The existence of a partnership-limited or general-is not essential in order that it shall apply. The language is comprehensive, and covers all cases where one has contributed to the capital of a business conducted by a partnership or person erroneously believing that he is a limited partner. It ought to be construed liberally, and with appropriate regard for the legislative purpose to relieve from the strictness of the earlier statutes and decisions. See Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n, 628 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 685; United States v. Colorado Anthracite Co., \n225 \nU.S. 219, 223\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 617; United States v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co., \n184 \nU.S. 49, 56\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 285. Its application should not be restricted to cases where there was an attempt to organize a limited partnership under that act. \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 564]\n\u00a0\n The petitioners assert that section 11 does not apply because the limited partnership certificate filed July 2, 1917, was false, in that it did not disclose the names of all the limited partners or the amount of the contributions of each. Their contention is that the other respondents were represented by Hecht and Finn, and that all should have been named in the certificate as limited partners, and that the amount advanced by each of the respondents should have been stated as his contribution to the capital. But the act of 1874 was repealed and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act was substituted for it before the certificate was filed and before the firm commenced business. Section 8 of the act of 1874 provides that:\n'If any false statement shall be made in such certificate ... all the persons interested ... shall be liable ... as general partners.'\n\n The later act is very different. It provides (section 6):\n'If the certificate contains a false statement, one who suffers loss by reliance on such statement may hold liable any party to the certificate who knew the statement to be false.'\n\n We do not find that the certificate was false within the meaning of section 8. But even if it was inaccurate or fales as asserted, liability of Hecht and Finn or the other respondents as general partners does not follow, because the act of 1874 was superseded, and because it is not shown that any creditors suffered loss by reliance upon any statement in the certificate.\n It must be held that Hecht and Finn are not liable as general partners.\n Petitioners contend that the respondents other than Hecht and Finn are liable as general partners. They argue that, in the attempt to form the limited partnership under the agreement signed June 30, Hecht and Finn were acting as the representatives of the other respondents; that the earlier agreement, signed by all and placed in escrow, was not abandoned; and that the limited partnership agreement and the Hecht-Finn trust agreement \n\n[263 U.S. 553, 565]\n\u00a0\n signed June 30 were calculated and intended to circumvent the rule of the New York Stock Exchange above referred to, without altering the substance of the plan of organization evidenced by the first agreement. But from the conclusion that Hecht and Finn are not liable as general partners, it necessarily follows that the other respondents cannot be held liable as such.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pierce v.

St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/4 a et seq .), authorizing the plaintiffs, who are licensed pharmacists conducting a general drug business in San Francisco, to use and sell in such business intoxicating liquors for other than beverage purposes. The District Court dismissed the bill as not stating a cause of action, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree on the ground that the suit could not be maintained without making the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a party defendant. 277 Fed. 632. The plaintiffs prosecute this appeal.\n National Prohibition Act, c. 85, tit. 2, 41 Stat. 307, commits its administration to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, authorizes him to prescribe regulations for carrying out its provisions, and declares, in clause 7 of section 1, that any act authorized to be done by the Commissioner 'may be performed by any assistant or agent designated by him for that purpose.'\n The act directly prohibits the manufacture, sale, etc., of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, and further provides in section 3, that liquor for nonbeverage purposes may be manufactured, purchased, sold, etc., 'but only as herein provided,' and, in section 6, that no one shall manufacture, sell, purchase, etc., any liquor 'without first obtaining a permit from the commissioner so to do'; that no permit shall be issued to any one to sell at retail, unless the selling is to be through a pharmacist designated in the permit and licensed under the state law to compound and dispense medicine under a physician's prescription; that every permit shall be 'signed by the Commissioner or his authorized agent' and shall 'designate and limit the acts that are permitted'; that the Commissioner 'shall prescribe the form of all permits,' and that where he refuses a permit the applicant 'may have a review of his decision before a court of equity.' \n\n[265 U.S. 388, 391]\n\u00a0\n The regulations prescribed provide for and designate a general agent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, called a prohibition commissioner, who is authorized, among other things, to issue and sign permits to sell liquor at retail for medicinal purposes through licensed pharmacists, and also a local agent in each state or district, called a prohibition director, who is authorized, among other things, to issue and sign permits to purchase liquor to be used and sold under the permits last mentioned. The regulations further contain a provision that:\n'Every permit will clearly and specifically designate and limit the acts that are permitted and the time when and the place where such acts may be performed.'\n\n The permit held by the plaintiffs was issued and signed by the prohibition commissioner, and the restriction therein of which the plaintiffs complain says 'this permit is issued for 100 gallons of distilled spirits and 5 gallons of wine per quarterly period.' The director adhered to the restriction by refusing to give the plaintiffs permits to purchase in excess of those quantities. The plaintiffs allege that the restriction was put in the permit without any lawful authority; that, if it be authorized by the regulations, the latter are void; and that the director by giving effect to it is wrongfully subjecting the plaintiffs to irreparable injury.\n The act and the regulations make it plain that the prohibition commissioner and the prohibition director are mere agents and subordinates of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. They act under his direction and perform such acts only as he commits to them by the regulations. They are responsible to him and must abide by his direction. What they do is as if done by him. He is the public's real representative in the matter, and, if the injunction were granted, his are the hands which would be tied. All this being so, he should have been made a party defendant-the principal one-and given \n\n[265 U.S. 388, 392]\n\u00a0\n opportunity to defend his direction and regulations. Litchfield v. Register and Receiver, 9 Wall. 575, 578; Plested v. Abbey, \n228 \nU.S. 42, 50\n, 51 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 503. In principle, Warner Valley Stock Co. v. Smith, \n165 U.S. 28\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 225, is well in point. There an injunction was sought against the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office to prevent them from giving effect to prior orders of the Secretary alleged to be outside his powers and hurtful to the plaintiff. While the suit was pending the Secretary resigned his office and there was at that time no way of bringing his successor into the suit. So the question arose whether it could be continued against the Commissioner alone. The answer was in the negative; the court saying (\n165 U.S. 34\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 228):\n'The purpose of the bill was to control the action of the Secretary of the Interior; the principal relief sought was against him; and the relief asked against the Commissioner of the General Land Office was only incidental, and by way of restraining him from executing the orders of his official head. To maintain such a bill against the subordinate officer alone, without joining his superior, whose acts are alleged to have been unlawful, would be contrary to settled rules of equity pleading. Calvert on Parties (2d Ed.) bk. 3, c. 13.\n\n'This is well exemplified by a decision of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke. Under acts of Parliament, appointing commissioners to build 50 new churches, appropriating money to support the ministers, and providing that the moveys appropriated should be paid to a treasurer, not one of the commissioners, but appointed by the crown, and should be by him disbursed and applied according to orders of the commissioners, Lord Hardwicke held that a bill by a minister of one of the churches to recover his stipend, and to have a fund in the treasurer's hands invested as required by the acts, could not be maintained against the treasurer alone, without joining any of the \n\n[265 U.S. 388, 393]\n\u00a0\n commissioners; and said: 'This is one of the most extraordinary bills I ever remember, and there is no foundation for relief, either in law or equity. It is brought against Mr. Blackerby, who is nothing but an officer under the commissioners for building the 50 new churches. It would be absurd if a bill should lie against a person who is only an officer and subordinate to others, and has no directory power.' 'I should think the commissioners only, and not the treasurer, ought to have been parties, for it is absurd to make a person who acts ministerially the sole party.' Vernon v. Blackerby, 2 Atk. 144, 146; s. c., Barnardiston, Ch. 377.'\n\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was a party without whose presence the suit could not be maintained; but the decree of the District Court should not have been affirmed. The decree was on the merits, and, as it was given in the absence of a necessary party, it should not have been permitted to stand.\n On the record as brought here it is not certain that the amount requisite to give the District Court jurisdiction was involved, but that question becomes immaterial in view of the conclusion reached on the other point.\n Decree reversed, with directions to dismiss the bill for want of a necessary party. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGONSALVES v.

The District Court, upon final hearing, dismissed the bill. 274 Fed. 975. And this direct appeal was prosecuted. Judicial Code,  238 (Comp. St.  1215). 1\n This Article2 provides that for the privilege of doing business in the State every foreign manufacturing and mercantile corporation3 shall pay in advance an annual franchise tax, to be computed by the State Tax Commission, at the rate of three per centum, upon the net income of the corporation for the preceding year. Sections 209, 215. This net income is 'presumably the same' as that upon which the corporation is required to pay a tax to the United States, section 209; but the amount thereof as returned to the United States is subject to any correction for fraud, evasion or errors, ascertained by the Commission, section 214. If the entire business of the corporation is not transacted within the State, the tax is to be based upon the portion of such ascertained net income determined by the proportion which the aggregate value of specified classes of the \n\n[266 U.S. 265, 267]\n\u00a0\n assets of the corporation within the State bears to the aggregate value of all of such classes of assets wherever located. Section 214. The corporation shall make the Commission a report showing the State of its organization 'and the kind of business transacted'; the amount of its net income for the preceding year as returned to the United States, and, if inaccurate, the amount claimed to be its net income; the value of the specified classes of its assets, within the State and wherever located; and such other facts as the Commission may require for the purpose of making the computation required. Section 211. The Commission shall audit and state the account and compute the tax thereon. Section 219-a.\n If within one year after the account is audited and stated the corporation files an application for revision, 'the commission shall grant a hearing thereon and if it shall be made to appear upon any such hearing by evidence submitted to it or otherwise, that any such account included taxes or other charges which could not have been lawfully demanded, or that payment has been illegally ... exacted of any such account, the commission shall resettle the same according to law and the facts, and adjust the account for taxes accordingly.' Section 218. The determination of the Commission upon any application for revision may be reviewed, both upon the law and the facts, upon certiorari by the Supreme Court, on all the evidence, papers and proceedings before the Commission, and, if found erroneous or illegal, the account shall be corrected and restated; and from any determination by the Supreme Court an appeal may be taken to the Court of Appeals. \n4\n Sections 199, 219. \n\n[266 U.S. 265, 268]\n\u00a0\n The Gorham Company is a Rhode Island corporation, engaged, under its charter, in the business of manufacturing and selling silverware, bronze and metal ware. All of its manufacturing is done in Rhode Island. It has there its main office and sells its ware to customers in all the States of the Union and some foreign countries. It also has a branch office and showrooms in New York City, where it keeps on hand a stock of its ware, partly samples, makes sales to customers from such stock and takes orders for ware to be shipped from the Rhode Island factory. In 1917, however, it also engaged extensively in the manufacture and sale of munitions. No part of this business was carried on in New York.\n The Company, in 1918, made a report to the Commission in compliance with the Tax Law. In this report, both as originally filed and later amended, it stated that the business which it transacted was 'manufacturing and selling silverware, bronze and metal ware'; gave the amount of its net income for the year 1917 as determined by the United States, claiming only one deduction therefrom, namely, the amount paid for Federal income taxes; and stated the aggregate values of the classes of its assets specified in the Tax Law, both in New York and wherever located. It did not, however, show that it was also engaged in manufacturing and selling munitions, that its net income as reported was derived to any extent from that business, or that it did not manufacture any ware in New York.\n The Commission thereupon audited and stated the Company's account, and computed the tax thereon, of which it gave the Company notice. \n5\n The Company however, \n\n[266 U.S. 265, 269]\n\u00a0\n did not apply to the Commission for a revision of the account and resettlement of the tax, but, within less than one year after the account had been audited and stated, brought this suit in the Federal Court to enjoin the collection of the tax.\n The Company insists that the inclusion in the net income upon which the tax was based of the income derived from business not carried on in New York, in the manufacture and sale of munitions and the manufacture of ware, and the allocation of that net income to New York by the statutory ratio into which only certain assets entered, has resulted in an assessment against it of a tax based upon an allocated income greatly in excess of that in fact derived from the business of selling ware which it carried on within the State. The grounds upon which it challenges the constitutionality of the law are, in substance, as summarized in its brief : (1) That a State cannot constitutionally levy a tax computed on an allocated part of the total net income of a foreign corporation, where the allocation includes certain arbitrarily selected factors, none of which are determinative of net income, and omits other factors equally important, and the result is to allot more income to the State than was earned there and employ income totally unrelated thereto to enlarge the measure of the tax; and (2) that such a tax upon the income earned without the State by a foreign corporation engaged principlally in interstate commerce, is a direct burden upon such commerce.\n We are of the opinion, however, that, without reference to these constitutional questions, the bill was properly dismissed by the District Court because of the failure of the Company to avail itself of the administrative remedy provided by the statute for the revision and correction of the tax.\n A taxpayer who does not exhaust the remedy provided before an administrative board to secure the correct as sessment \n\n[266 U.S. 265, 270]\n\u00a0\n of a tax, cannot thereafter be heard by a judicial tribunal to assert its invalidity. Farncomb v. Denver, \n252 \nU.S. 7, 10\n, 40 S. Ct. 271; Milheim v. Tunnel District, \n262 \nU.S. 710, 723\n, 43 S. Ct. 694; McGregor v. Hogan, \n263 \nU.S. 234, 238\n, 44 S. Ct. 50; First Nat. Bank v. Weld County, \n264 \nU.S. 450, 455\n, 44 S. Ct. 385.\n The Company did not report to the Commission any of the facts upon which it now challenges the validity of the tax. Its report indicated that its net income was derived solely from carrying on in New York and elsewhere the unitary business of manufacturing and selling ware. After the account had been audited and the tax computed, it was entitled, as a matter of right, to make application for a revision of the tax and to a hearing before the Commission, at which it might submit evidence; and if it appeared that the account included taxes which could not have been lawfully demanded, the Commission was required to resettle the same 'according to law and the facts,' and adjust the tax accordingly. The Company, however, made no application to the Commission for a revision of the tax; it submitted no evidence to the Commission as to any of the matters on which it now relies, either as to the inclusion of profits derived from the munitions business or otherwise; and it did not request the Commission to resettle the tax on the ground of any error or invalidity, in matter either of fact or law.\n Under these circumstances we think that the Company, having failed to avail itself of the administrative remedy provided by the statute for the correction of the tax, was not entitled to maintain a bill in equity for the purpose of enjoining its collection.\n The decree of the District Court is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This case was formerly before this Court in Gorham Manufacturing Co. v. Wendell, \n261 \nU.S. 1\n, 43 S. Ct. 313, in which a substitution of parties was allowed. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] This Article was inserted in the Tax Law (Consol.

And it is conceded that the Commission did not deduct the Federal income taxes from the net income. \n\n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOTO v. LANE(1924)\nNo. 463\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 393, 394]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas W. Gregory, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 393, 398]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frederick Milverton, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the District Court of Hawaii refusing a writ of habeas corpus sought by 13 persons in custody under a judgment of conviction in a territorial circuit court on an indictment for an infamous crime against the laws of that territory.\n In stating the offense, the indictment used the disjunctive 'or' in several instances where the conjunctive 'and' doubtless would have been used by an attentive \n\n[265 U.S. 393, 399]\n\u00a0\n draftsman. Had the matter introduced by the disjunctive been omitted in each instance, or had it been introduced by a conjunctive, the indictment plainly would have stated an offense against the statute under which it was drawn. But in the latter of these situations the accusation and the range of admissible proof would have been broader than in the former. The indictment was not assailed in the circuit court because of any uncertainty in the accusation. On the contrary, the defendants and their counsel stipulated in writing with the prosecuting officer that the indictment should be 'considered and understood' as 'reading in the conjunctive instead in the disjunctive,' that it should be taken as 'not uncertain,' and that any defect arising from the use of the disjunctive was waived. The circuit judge indorsed his approval on the stipulation, and it was filed in the cause; but no change was made in the indictment itself. The trial was had thereafter, counsel and the court proceeding as if the disjunctive rightly should be construed and understood as a conjunctive.\n After conviction, the petitioners took the case to the Supreme Court of the territory on various exceptions reserved to rulings in the course of the trial. In that court one of their attorneys contended, over the disapproval of another, that the indictment was made so uncertain by the use of the disjunctive that it did not inform the petitioners of the nature and cause of the accusation as required by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, and that the stipulation was void under the Fifth Amendment because the indictment was thereby amended without a resubmission to the grand jury. The Supreme Court, referring to these contentions, said:\n'We are of the opinion that the stipulation in question cannot be construed as amounting to an amendment of the indictment. The trial court did express its approval of the stipulation and of the waiver contained therein, but \n\n[265 U.S. 393, 400]\n\u00a0\n it did not amend the indictment or attempt or purport to do so. ... If it might under other circumstances reasonably be said that, by reason of the allegations in question being in the disjunctive, instead of the conjunctive, there was some doubt as to what crime defendants were charged with, does it not expressly appear in this case that not a vestige of doubt exists, when the defendants themselves have distinctly and unequivocally said, and their counsel learned in the law have solemnly stipulated and agreed in writing, that neither the defendants nor their counsel had any doubt whatever of the nature of the accusation against the defendants?'\n\n And again:\n'As to whether, if an indictment palpably stated no offense at all or the semblance of any offense, an accused could waive his right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, under the facts in the present case we are not required to say. There are, indeed, many authorities to the effect that an indictment which, in seeking to inform the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, charges the offense in the disjunctive instead of the conjunctive, is bad, upon the theory that it charges no offense at all. But, as pointed out in Territory v. Kim Ung Pil, 26 Hawaii, 725, even the courts which so hold concede that the rule is not without qualifications. Its merits need not be here considered . ... When, as in the case at bar, the defendants and their able counsel have solemnly said to the court, after ample time for study and reflection, that they understand the indictment, that the presence of the word 'or' does not mislead them or in any wise embarrass them in their defense and that the indictment fully informs them of the nature and terms of the charge against them, the alleged insufficiency or defectiveness of the indictment is one which may be constitutionally waived. Any other conclusion would, we think, be an affront to justice and common sense.' \n\n[265 U.S. 393, 401]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court overruled the exceptions, but did not render a judgment of affirmance, for under the local law that was not admissible in cases brought before the court only on exceptions reserved. Therefore that decision could not be brought to this court for review. Cotton v. Hawaii, \n211 U.S. 162\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 85; Hutchins v. Bierce, \n211 U.S. 429\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 122. But, had the petitioners so chosen, they could have taken the case to that court on writ of error instead of on the reserved exceptions, and in that event a judgment of affirmance, if involving the denial of a right asserted under the Constitution, could have been brought by writ of error to this court for review in regular course. Spreckels v. Brown, \n212 U.S. 208\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 256. The petitioners, however, elected to proceed the other way.\n\n With this statement of the situation and proceedings in the territorial courts, we turn to the petition for habeas corpus presented in the District Court. In it the petitioners set forth the indictment, the stipulation and the judgment of the trial court, and then took the position, first, that the use of the disjunctive rendered the indictment so uncertain that it did not meet the requirement of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution; and, secondly, that the stipulation effected a change in the indictment without a resubmission to a grand jury and that this was in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court denied the petition on the ground that the case was not one in which the relief sought should be awarded.\n In the federal courts a discharge on habeas corpus of a prisoner held to answer a criminal accusation or confined under a judgment of conviction is granted only in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion. Salinger v. Loisel, \n265 U.S. 224\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 519, 68 L. Ed. --; Storti v. Massachusetts, \n183 \nU.S. 138, 143\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 72. The remedy is an extraordinary one, out of the usual course, and involves a collateral attack on the process or judgment constituting the basis of the detention. The instances in which it is granted, when the law \n\n[265 U.S. 393, 402]\n\u00a0\n has provided another remedy in regular course, are exceptional and usually confined to situations where there is peculiar and pressing need for it or where the process or judgment under which the prisoner is held is wholly void.\n This case does not measure up to that test. The circuit court in which the petitioners were tried and convicted undoubtedly had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of their persons, and the sentence imposed was not in excess of its power. The offense charged was neither colorless nor an impossible one under the law. The construction to be put on the indictment, its sufficiency and the effect to be given to the stipulation were all matters the determination of which rested primarily with that court. If it erred in determining them, its judgment was not for that reason void (Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 203; Ex parte Parks, \n93 U.S. 18\n, 20; Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651, 654\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 152), but subject to correction in regular course on writ of error. If the questions presented involved the application of constitutional principles, that alone did not alter the rule. Markuson v. Boucher, \n175 U.S. 184\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 76. And, if the petitioners permitted the time within which a review on writ of error might be obtained to elapse and thereby lost the opportunity for such a review, that gave no right to resort to habeas corpus as a substitute. Riddle v. Dyche, \n262 U.S. 333\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 555. And see Craig v. Hecht, \n263 U.S. 255\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 103, 68 L. Ed. --.\n The petitioners rely on Ex parte Bain, \n121 U.S. 1\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 781, where it was held that an actual amendment of an indictment for an infamous crime without a resubmission to the grand jury rendered the indictment void and left the court without power to proceed to a trial. But, as was said by the Supreme Court of the territory, the indictment here was not amended. The purpose of the stipulation was not to alter or change the indictment but to show that the parties construed and understood the accusation in a particular way and desired the court to do \n\n[265 U.S. 393, 403]\n\u00a0\n the same. Had the court done so without the stipulation, that might have been an error in the exercise of jurisdiction, but it would not have worked an entire disability to proceed to a trial and judgment. And had the accused been acquitted it hardly would be said that the acquittal was void. The stipulation did not alter the situation in these respects.\n We find no special circumstances in the case which should have required the District Court, in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, to discharge the petitioners.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGUARANTY TITLE & TRUST CORPORATION v. U S(1924)\nNo. 109\nArgued: November 14, 1923Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 200, 201]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. R. F. Wells and Robert B. Tunstall, both of Norfolk, Va., for appellant.\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n Mr. H. H. Rumble, of Norfolk, Va., for appellee Norfolk-Hampton Roads Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1873, the Vue de L'Eau Company, a Virginia corporation, owned a tract of about 294 acres at Hampton Roads, Va. It platted the 'Prize Lot Reserve' (hereinafter called the 'Reserve'), containing 4.55 acres, into lots and streets. In January, 1874, after having sold 7 of these lots, it made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, and conveyed to trustees all of its land except the Reserve. Then the company became dormant. No organization was kept up. It had no directors or officers. But there was no formal dissolution or surrender of the charter. Thereafter no action was taken by or in behalf of the company in reference to this land. It was allowed to remain in its former condition and to develop forest growth. \n\n[264 U.S. 200, 202]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Claims found that in 1899 the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company purchased a large acreage of land, including that immediately surrounding the Reserve, and, in the language of the findings of fact:\n'... Upon purchasing said lands the plaintiff company [Norfolk- Hampton Roads Company], without any right, title or interest, or claim of right, title, or interest, in or to the lots or land of said Prize Lot Reserve, and, with full knowledge of the fact that it had no claim of right, title, or interest in or to any part of said lots or land, deliberately set about trying to acquire title to said lots and land by adverse possession, and in the course of its efforts to so acquire title thereto the following action was taken: The plaintiff company ... took possession of said holdings and from thenceforward to the time of its taking by the government in June, 1917, treated the land of said Reserve as though it belonged to the plaintiff company. It recorded plats of its said property, in which the land of said Reserve was included and indicated as a part of the company's holdings. The company's advertising matter issued in 1899 indicated as belonging to the company lands which included the lands of said Reserve, and said land was included in the company's subdivision known as 'Subdivision No. 1, Norfolk on the Roads,' a plat of which, stating said subdivision to be the 'Property of Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company,' was recorded in the county clerk's office on June 14, 1901. In the development of its said property, streets were opened and graded through the land of said Reserve, timber was cut therefrom and used or marketed by the company, and bulkheads were built by the company in front of the property to protect it from erosion by the waves and tides. Said company also leased an area of its lands to the Jamestown Exposition Company, in 1907, including therewith said Prize Lot Reserve land as belonging to plaintiff company, and thereafter, upon the termination of the Exposition Company's lease, \n\n[264 U.S. 200, 203]\n\u00a0\n said lands were leased by plaintiff company to another tenant, by whom they were occupied for some time; and in general the land of said Reserve was held out and treated by plaintiff company as being the property of said company. It does not satisfactorily appear who, if any one, paid the taxes on said land between the years 1874 and 1917.'\n\n June 28, 1917, the United States, pursuant to an Act of Congress of June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 207, took 9.22 acres of land fronting on Hampton Roads for a naval base, made up of the Reserve and 4.67 acres immediately surrounding it. At that time the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company was in possession of the tract taken. The compensation fixed by the President, $ 37,000, was not satisfactory. Payment of 75 per cent., as provided by the act, was not made, because there was a question as to the title to the Reserve. The company sued the United States in the Court of Claims. 40 Stat. 207, 208; Judicial Code,  145 (Comp. St.  1136). Thereafter, in a suit brought in the circuit court of the city of Norfolk, Va., against the Vue de L'Eau Company by one of its stockholders, the Guaranty Title & Trust Corporation was appointed receiver of the company, to take charge of its property and to prosecute claims and suits for the protection of its rights and interests. The receiver intervened in this case in the Court of Claims, alleging that the Vue de L'Eau Company was the owner of the Reserve at the time of the taking, and that it is entitled to compensation therefor. The Court of Claims found that, at time of the taking, that part of the tract, title to which is not in controversy, was worth $35,500, and that the Reserve, claimed by both parties, was worth $33,000, and gave judgment in favor of the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company for the whole, $68, 500. The receiver appealed. September 22, 1922, Congress made appropriation for the payment of this judgment. \n\n[264 U.S. 200, 204]\n\u00a0\n 42 Stat. 1052. The amount fixed as compensation for the land not claimed by appellant was paid. Because of the claim of appellant, the United States withholds payment of the balance until the determination of this appeal. June 4, 1923, this court granted leave to the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company to intervene as party appellee, and required appellant to give bond '... to secure the payment of costs of the appeal as well as interest on $33,000. ...'\n The owner at the time of the taking is entitled to the balance remaining unpaid. The question for decision is whether the Vue de L'Eau Company or the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company was then the owner of the Reserve.\n A Virginia statute provides that:\n'No person shall make an entry on, or bring an action to recover, any land lying east of the Alleghany Mountains, but within fifteen years ... next after the time at which the right to make such entry or bring such action shall have first accrued to himself or to some person through whome he claims. ...' Code 1919,  5805\n\n\n\n By adverse possession and lapse of time the owner's right of entry or action is barred, and title is acquired by the occupant. Cochran v. Hiden, 130 Va. 123, 142, 107 S. E. 708; Virginia Midland Railroad Co. v. Barbour, 97 Va. 118, 123, 33 S. E. 554; Creekmur v. Creekmur, 75 Va. 430, 435, 439; Thomas v. Jones, 28 Grat. (Va.) 383, 387; Middleton v. Johns, 4 Grat. (Va.) 129.\n The disseisor need not have a deed or other writing giving color of title or furnishing foundation for belief or claim of ownership or legal right to enter or take possession of land. Sometimes misapprehension arises from the somewhat misleading, if not inaccurate, terms frequently used, such as 'claim of right,' 'claim of title,' and 'claim of ownership.' 'These terms, when used in this connection, mean nothing more than the intention of the disseisor to appropriate and use the land as his own to the \n\n[264 U.S. 200, 205]\n\u00a0\n exclusion of all others.' Carpenter v. Coles, 75 Minn. 9, 11, 77 N. W. 424. On the facts found, it is clear that the necessary adverse intent of the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company existed from 1899 to the time of the taking. Cochran v. Hiden, supra; Brock v. Bear, 100 Va. 562, 565, 42 S. E. 307; Haney v. Breeden, 100 Va. 781, 784, 42 S. E. 916; Virginia Midland Railroad Co. v. Barbour, 97 Va. 122, 33 S.

E. 546.\n The Reserve was inclosed on all its sides, excepting the water front, by land acquired by the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company in 1899. In that year it issued advertising matter indicating the land as belonging to it. It included the Reserve and asserted ownership of it in a plat filed in 1901. It did not leave the land in a state of nature, but changed and improved it. It opened and graded streets, cut and removed timber for its own use and for sale, protected the water front by construction of bulkheads, and leased it to others. It platted, occupied, and treated the Reserve just as it did surrounding land which it purchased. Its acts were sufficient to apprise every one of its exclusive occupation and use. Its assertion of ownership was unequivocal, emphatic, and public. The findings show that the possession met all the requirements of law under the decisions of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. Kincheloe v. Tracewells, supra, 602; Creekmur v. Creekmur, supra, 434; Virginia Midland Railroad Co. v. Barbour, supra. See, also, Taylor v. Burnsides, 1 Grat. ( Va.) 165, 192, 198, 201; Harman v. Ratliff, 93 Va. 249, 253, 24 S.

And the facts make out adverse possession under the rule generally applied. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[264 U.S. 200, 206]\n\u00a0\n The judgment is affirmed. In addition to costs of this appeal, the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company is entitled to interest to be paid by appellant on $33,000 since September 22, 1922, until funds are available for payment by the United States of the balance of the judgment.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Alice State Bank v.

St.  3530). It declares that:\n'The Constitution of the United States, and all the laws thereof which are not locally inapplicable, shall have the same force and effect within the said territory as elsewhere in the United States.'\n\n It also created a legislature, with power and authority which 'shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,' subject to specified restrictions. One of them is this:\n'Nor shall the lands or other property of nonresidents be taxed higher than the lands or other property of residents.'\n\n While residing in California, appellant was employed by appellee corporation, owner and operator, to serve as seaman and fisherman upon the sailing vessel Star of Finland. He sailed upon her to Alaska, and served with her there while she engaged in fishing, from the middle of May, 1921, until the middle of September. In compliance with the abovementioned statutes, appellee paid the taxes which they imposed upon him, and on final settlement charged the same against his wages. By this proceeding he seeks to recover the amount so deducted. Without opinion the court below sustained the validity of the taxes. Both statutes have been considered and \n\n[263 U.S. 510, 514]\n\u00a0\n upheld by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Alaska Packers' Association v. Hedenskoy, 267 Fed. 154; Northern Commercial Co. v. Territory of Alaska, 289 Fed. 786.\n Plainly, we think, the territorial Legislature had authority under the terms of the Organic Act to impose both the head and the license tax, unless, for want of power, Congress itself could not have laid them by direct action. Talbott v. Silver Bow County, \n139 \nU.S. 438, 448\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 594; Binns v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 486, 491\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 816; Alaska Pacific Fisheries v.

Ct. 241.\n Appellant went to the territory for the purpose of engaging in the business of fishing, and remained there for at least four months. He was not merely passing through-not a mere sightseer or tourist-but for a considerable period while so employed enjoyed the protection and was within the jurisdiction of the local government. To require him to contribute something toward its support did not deprive him of property without due process of law, within the Fifth Amendment. Such cases as Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 U.S. 193\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 379, and Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 202\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493, relied upon to support the contrary view, are not controlling.\n The tax was upon an individual actually within the territory; there was no attempt to reach something in a mere state of transit or beyond the borders. Some general rules touching the taxation of property were pointed out in Brown v. Houston, \n114 \nU.S. 622, 632\n, 633 S., 5 Sup. Ct. 1091, and Pullman's Palace Car Company v. Pennsylvania, \n141 U.S. 18\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 876. No more stringent ones should be applied when poll taxes are questioned. Unless restrained by constitutional provision, the sovereign has power to tax all persons and property actually within its jurisdiction and enjoying the benefit and protection of its laws. Cooley on Taxation (3d Ed.) p. 22. \n\n[263 U.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n We are not here concerned with taxation by a state. The license tax cannot be said to conflict with section 2, art. 4, of the Constitution:\n'The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.'\n\n It applies only to nonresident fishermen; citizens of every state are treated alike. Only residents of the territory are preferred. This is not wholly arbitrary or unreasonable, and we find nothing in the Constitution which prohibits Congress from favoring those who have acquired a local residence and upon whose efforts the future development of the territory must largely depend. See Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, supra, and Alaska Fish Co. v. Smith, \n255 \nU.S. 44, 47\n, 48 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 219.\n None of the points relied upon by appellant is well taken, and the decree below must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAMMERSCHMIDT v. U S(1924)\n\nArgued: Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n Messrs. Ed. F. Alexander, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Joseph W. Sharts, of Dayton, Ohio, for petitioners. \n\n[265 U.S. 182, 183]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a review by certiorari of the conviction of thirteen persons charged in one indictment with the crime of violating section 37 of the Penal Code (Comp. St.  10201). The charge was that the petitioners willfully and unlawfully conspired to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating a lawful function of its government, to wit, that of registering for military service all male persons between the ages of 21 and 30, as required by the Selective Service Act of May 18, 1917 (40 Stat. 76 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2044a- 2044g, 2044h-2044k]), through the printing, publishing and circulating of handbills, dodgers, and other matter intended and designed to counsel, advise, and procure persons subject to the Selective Act to refuse to obey it. A demurrer to the indictment was overruled, and trial and conviction followed. By exception and assignment of error the question is properly made whether a crime described as above can be said to be a conspiracy to defraud the United States. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. 287 Fed. 817.\n The indictment was framed, and the argument of the government in support of the conviction is based, on the language of this court in Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 479\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 249, 253 (54 L. Ed. 569, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112), construing section 5440, R. S. (now section 37 of the Penal Code), which reads as follows:\n'If two or more persons conspire ... to defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, all the parties to such conspiracy shall be liable,' etc.\n\n The opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Lurton, and the words relied on are:\n'The statute is broad enough in its terms to include any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing, obstructing \n\n[265 U.S. 182, 186]\n\u00a0\n or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.'\n\n This language it is contended necessarily embraces a conspiracy to defeat the selective draft by inducing the persons required to register under is to defeat its purpose by refusing to register.\n We think the words relied on cannot be given such a wide meaning when we consider the case to which they were applied, and when we replace them in the context. The court was dealing with an appeal in a habeas corpus case to test the validity of an order of removal of the appellant under section 1014, R. S. The main question was whether the indictments under which the removal was ordered charged an offense against the United States. They charged two sets of conspiracies. One was that the defendant with two others, one an associate statistician in the Department of Agriculture, conspired to obtain secret official information which the statistician in violation of his official duty was to give out to his co-conspirators concerning the cotton crop reports in advance of the time they were to be published according to law; another was that the statistician was to falsify one of the reports of which his associates were to be advised in advance; another was that the defendant and one associate were to bribe the statistician to make the false report and publish it in advance. The second conspiracy involving the defendant, the statistician, and other persons, was similar in detail to the first. All of the information in advance of the official publication was to be used for speculative purposes in the open market. The opinion describes the official machinery in the Agricultural Department for acquiring the information upon which the cotton reports each monty were based, and shows that they were approved by the Secretary, and that by regulation the employees were required to keep them and their details secret until duly published, and points out that \n\n[265 U.S. 182, 187]\n\u00a0\n they were of great value and vitally affected the market price of the cotton crop.\n The appellant in that case urged that the conspiracy to defraud the United States, punished in the section must result in financial loss to the government. It was this contention which the court was meeting and upon this point it said:\n'These counts do not expressly charge that the conspiracy included any direct pecuniary loss to the United States, but as it is averred that the acquiring of the information and its intelligent computation, with deductions, comparisons and explanations involved great expense, it is clear that practices of this kind would deprive these reports of most of their value to the public and degrade the department in general estimation, and that there would be a real financial loss. But it is not essential that such a conspiracy shall contemplate a finacial loss or that one shall result.'\n\n And then follows the sentence already quoted upon which the government relies.\n It is obvious that the writer of the opinion and the court were not considering whether deceit or trickery was essential to satisfy the defrauding required under the statute. The facts in the case were such that that question was not presented. The deceit of the public, the trickery in the advance publication secured by bribery of an official, and the falsification of the reports made the fraud and deceit so clear as the gist of the offenses actually charged that their presence was not in dispute. The sole question was whether the fraud there practiced must have inflicted upon the government pecuniary loss, or whether its purpose and effect to defeat a lawful function of the government and injure others thereby was enough. That was all that Mr. Justice Lurton's words can be construed to mean. The cases in which this case has been referred to involved unquestioned deceit or false pretense, and it was only cited in them to the point that financial \n\n[265 U.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n loss of the government is not necessary to violate the section. United States v. Foster, \n233 \nU.S. 515, 526\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 666; United States v. Barnow, 239 U. S. also, United States v. Plyler, \n222 U.S. 15\n, also, United States v. Plyler, \n222 U.S. 1\nk, 32 Sup. Ct. 6, in respect to section 5418, R. S. (Comp. St.  10192).\n To conspire to defraud the United States means primarily to cheat the government out of property or money, but it also means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest. It is not necessary that the government shall be subjected to property or pecuniary loss by the fraud, but only that its legitimate official action and purpose shall be defeated by misrepresentation, chicane, or the overreaching of those charged with carrying out the governmental intention. It is true that words 'to defraud' as used in some statutes have been given a wide meaning, wider than their ordinary scope. They usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane, or overreaching. They do not extend to theft by violence. They refer rather to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes. One would not class robbery or burglary among frauds. In Horman v. United States, 116 Fed. 350, 53 C. C. A. 570, Section 5480, R. S., as amended March 2, 1889 (25 Stat, 873 [Comp. St.  10385]), making it a crime to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud by use of the mails and opening correspondence with any person, and to mail a letter in execution thereof, was held to be violated by the sending of a letter threatening to blacken the character of another, unless that other paid the blackmailer money. It was held that the word 'scheme' in that section was of broader meaning and did not necessarily involve trickery or cunning in the scheme, if use of the mails was part of it; that intent to defraud in such a statute was satisfied by the wrongful purpose of injuring one in his property rights. The question had much consideration. The decision, however, went to the verge and should be confined \n\n[265 U.S. 182, 189]\n\u00a0\n to pecuniary or property injury inflicted by a scheme to use the mails for the purpose. Section 5480 has since been again amended to make its scope clearer. Its construction in the Horman Case cannot be used as authority to include within the legal definition of a conspiracy to defraud the United States a mere open defiance of the governmental purpose to enforce a law by urging persons subject to it to disobey it.\n We think the demurrer to the indictment in this case should have been sustained and the indictment quashed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHECHT v. MALLEY(1924)\nNo. 119\nArgued: May 3, 1924Decided: May 12, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 144, 145]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward F. McClennen, of Boston, Mass., for petitioners Hecht, Howard, and others.\n Messrs. Harrison M. Davis and Felix Rackemann, both of Boston, Mass., for petitioners Crocker and others.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These four cases, which were heard together, involve the question whether the trustees of three 'Massachusetts Trusts' are subject to the special excise taxes imposed upon certain 'associations' by the Revenue Act of 1916 \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 146]\n\u00a0\n (39 Stat. 756, c. 463), and the Revenue Act of 19181 (40 Stat. 1057, c. 18 ), based upon the value of their capital stock.\n The petitioners in Case No. 99 are the trustees of the 'Hecht Real Estate Trust'; in Nos. 100 and 101, the trustees of the 'Hay-market Trust'; and in No. 119, the trustees of the 'Crocker, Burbank & Co. Ass'n.' Excise taxes were assessed against them under these Acts and paid under protest. \n2\n They then brought suits for refund in the Federal District Court in Massachusetts, an had recoveries. 276 Fed. 830. The judgments in their favor were reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 281 Fed. 363. And these writs of certiorari were granted. \n260 \nU.S. 715, 717\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 93.\n The 'Massachusetts Trust' is a form of business organization, common in that State,3 consisting essentially of an arrangement whereby property is conveyed to trustees, in accordance with the terms of an instrument of trust, to be held and managed for the benefit of such persons as may from time to time be the holders of transferable certificates issued by the trustees showing the shares into which the beneficial interest in the property \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 147]\n\u00a0\n is divided. These certificates, which resemble certificates for shares of stock in a corporation and are issued and transferred in like manner, entitle the holders to share ratably in the income of the property, and, upon termination of the trust, in the proceeds.\n Under the Massachusetts decisions these trust instruments are held to create either pure trusts or partnerships, according to the way in which the trustees are to conduct the affairs committed to their charge. If they are the principals and are free from the control of the certificate holders in the management of the property, a trust is created; but if the certificate holders are associated together in the control of the property as principals and the trustees are merely their managing agents, a partnership relation between the certificate holders is created. Williams v. Milton, 215 Mass. 1, 5, 102 N. E. 355; Frost v. Thompson, 219 Mass. 360, 365, 106 N. E. 1009; Dana v. Treasurer, 227 Mass. 562, 565, 116 N. E. 941; Priestly v. Treasurer, 230 Mass. 452, 455, 120 N. E. 100.\n These trusts-whether pure trusts or partnerships-are unincorporated. They are not organized under any statute; and they derive no power, benefit or privilege from any statute. The Massachusetts statutes, however, recognize their existence and impose upon them, as 'associations,' certain obligations and liabilities. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The Hecht Real Estate Trust was established by the members of the Hecht family upon real estate in Boston used for offices and business purposes, which they owned as tenants in common. It is primarily a family affair. The certificates have no par value; the shares being for \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 148]\n\u00a0\n one-thousandths of the beneficial interest. They are transferable; but must be offered to the trustees before being transferred to any person outside of the family. The trustees have full and complete powers of management; but no power to create any liability against the certificate holders. There are no meetings of certificate holders; but they may, by written instrument, increase the number of trustees, remove a trustee, appoint a new trustee if there be none remaining, modify the declaration of trust in any particular, terminate the trust, or give the trustees any instructions thereunder.\n The Haymarket Trust is strictly a business enterprise. It was established by the original subscribers who furnished the money for the purchase of a building in Boston used for store and office purposes. The shares are of the par value of $100 each. Except as otherwise restricted, the trustees have general and exclusive powers of management, but no power to bind the certificate holders personally. At any annual or special meeting of the certificate holders, they may fill any vacancies in the number of trustees, depose any or all the trustees and elect others in their place, authorize the sale of the property or any part thereof, and alter or amend the agreement of trust.\n The Crocker, Burbank & Co. Ass'n is also a business enterprise. It was formerly entitled the Wachusett Realty Trust. The certificates have no par value; the shares being for ninety-six thousandths of the beneficial interest in the property. The trustees originally held the fee of certain lands subject to a long lease and the stock of a Massachusetts corporation engaged in manufacturing paper and owning and operating several mills. In Crocker v. Malley, \n249 U.S. 223\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 270, 2 A. L. R. 1061 (1919), in which the original trust instrument was before the court, it was held that the trustees were not subject as to the dividends received from the corporation to the tax imposed by the Income Tax Act of 1913 (38 Stat. 172) upon the net income of 'every corporation, \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 149]\n\u00a0\n joint-stock company or association, ... organized in the United States,' but were subject only to the duties imposed by the Act upon trustees. The original trust agreement involved in that case has now, however, been modified, with the assent of the certificate holders. By this modification 'the form of [the] organization' was specifically 'changed to that of an association,' under its present name. The trustees were authorized to surrender the stock of the manufacturing corporation, to acquire instead its entire property, and to carry on the business theretofore conducted by it, or any substantially similar business. The title to all the trust property 'and the right to conduct all the business' were vested exclusively in the trustees, who were authorized to designate from their number a president and other officers and to prescribe their duties. The certificate holders were authorized, at any meeting, to remove any trustee and elect trustees to fill any vacancies. Since the modification of the trust agreement the trustees have carried on the manufacturing business in substantially the same manner as it was formerly conducted by the corporation.\n To determine rightly the scope and effect of the Revenue Acts now in question it is necessary to bear in mind the previous legislation on the same subject, and the interpretation given it by the decisions of this Court.\n Section 38 of the Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 12- commonly called the Corporation Tax Law-provided:\n'That every corporation, joint stock company or association, organized for profit and having a capital stock represented by shares, and every insurance company, now or hereafter organized under the laws of the United States or of any State or Territory, ... or now or hereafter organized under the laws of any foreign country and engaged in business in any State or Territory of the United States ... shall be subject to pay annually a special excise tax with respect to the carrying on or doing business, \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 150]\n\u00a0\n ... equivalent to one per centum upon the entire net income over and above five thousand dollars received by it from all sources; ... or if organized under the laws of any foreign country, ... from business transacted and capital invested within the United States and its Territories. ...'5\n\n In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312 (1911), the court, in sustaining the constitutionality of this section of the Act, said that the domestic corporations, joint stock companies or associations, as well as the insurance companies, 'must be such as are now or hereafter organized under the laws of the United States or of any State or Territory,' and that the tax was imposed 'upon the doing of business with the advantages which inhere in the peculiarities of corporate or joint stock organizations of the character described,' that is, 'upon the exercise of the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity, as such business is done under authority of state franchises.'\n In Eliot v. Freeman, \n220 \nU.S. 178, 185\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 360, 361(1911), it was held that this excise tax did not apply to two typical Massachusetts trusts. The court said:\n'Under the terms of the Corporation Tax Law, corporations and joint stock associations must be such as are 'now or hereafter organized under the laws of the United States or of any State or Territory. ... ' The language ... 'now or hereafter organized under the laws of the United States,' etc., imports an organization deriving power from statutory enactment. ... The description of the corporation or joint stock association as one organized under the laws of a State at once suggests that they are such as are the creation of statutory law, from which they derive their powers and are qualified to carry on their operations. ... Entertaining the view that it was the \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 151]\n\u00a0\n intention of Congress to embrace within the corporation tax statute only such corporations and joint stock associations as are organized under some statute, or derive from that source some quality or benefit not existing at the common law, we are of opinion that the real estate trusts involved in these two cases are not within the terms of the act.'\n\n We come now to the consideration of the Acts involved in the present cases.\n\n 1. \nRevenue Act of 1916.-Section 407, title 4, of this Act provides ( 39 Stat. p. 789 [Comp. St.  5980a]) that:\n'Every corporation, joint-stock company or association, now or hereafter organized in the United States for profit and having a capital stock represented by shares, and every insurance company, now or hereafter organized under the laws of the United States, or any State or Territory, ... shall pay annually a special excise tax with respect to the carrying on or doing business, ... equivalent to 50 cents for each $1,000 of the fair value of its capital stock,'\n\n including the surplus and undivided profits, but less an exemption of $ 99,000 from the capital stock.\n And, in a separate paragraph, that:\n'Every corporation, joint-stock company or association, or insurance company, now or hereafter organized for profit under the laws of any foreign country and engaged in business in the United States shall pay annually a special excise tax, ... equivalent to 50 cents for each $1,000 of the capital actually invested in the transaction of its business in the United States.'\n\n Section 10, title 1 (Comp. St.  6336j), also provides that there shall be paid annually a tax of two per centum upon the net income received 'by every corporation, joint-stock company or association, or insurance company, organized in the United States, no matter how created or organized.'\n The bill as introduced in the House of Representatives contained this provision for an income tax, but no provision \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 152]\n\u00a0\n for an excise tax. It was amended in the Senate so as to impose on every corporation, joint-stock company or association, as defined and limited in section 10, title 1, that is, 'organized in the United States, no matter how created or organized,' a special tax of 50 cents for each $1,000 'of capital, surplus and undivided profits used in any of the activities or functions of their business.' The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, in reporting the bill with this amendment, referred to it as 'imposing a small tax upon corporations in the nature of a license tax for doing business.' The House, however, did not agree to this amendment. And later, pursuant to the report of a Conference Committee, there was inserted in the bill, in lieu of the Senate amendment, the provision for a special excise tax now contained in section 407 of the Act, in which the words 'no matter how created or organized' were omitted, and the words 'organized under the laws of the United States, or any State or Territory,' which had been contained in the Act of 1909, were inserted. 64th Cong. 1st Sess. H. R. 16763, and Sen. Rep. No. 793, pt. 1, p. 2; 53 Cong. Rec. pt. 11, p. 10663 and part 13, p. 14020.\n It thus appears that Congress intended to make a clear distinction between the provisions relating to the income tax and to the excise tax, and purposely framed them, as shown by the amendment incorporated in the bill before its final passage, so that while the income tax provision should apply to all domestic corporations, joint-stock companies or associations, no matter how created or organized, the excise tax provision should only apply to such as were organized under statutory law. See United States v. Publishing Co., \n219 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 212, 21 Ann. Cas. 942; United States v. St. Paul Railway, \n247 \nU.S. 310, 318\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 525\n\n\n The words, 'now or hereafter organized under the laws of the United States or any State or Territory' appear in the Act of 1916 in precisely the same place with reference \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 153]\n\u00a0\n to the preceding words 'every corporation, joint-stock company or association' as in the Act of 1909, and are separated from them in like manner by the phrase 'and every insurance company,' followed by the like comma. And it is clear that in the intermediate phrase 'now or hereafter organized in the United States for profit and having a capital stock represented, by shares,' the words 'in the United States' were inserted in the Act of 1916 after the word 'organized' merely by reason of the fact that this Act refers to domestic and foreign corporations, joint-stock companies and associations in two separate paragraphs instead of in the same paragraph as in the Act of 1909. The words 'organized in the United States' have no different effect, as applied to domestic corporations, joint-stock companies and associations, from the word 'organized' as used in the Act of 1909, and in no wise remove the ensuing general limitation that they must be such as are 'organized under the laws of the United States, or any State or Territory.'\n And since these limiting words, when used in the Act of 1909, had been held by this Court, in Eliot v. Freeman, to show the intention of Congress to embrace within the statute only such corporations and joint- stock associations as 'are organized under some statute, or derive from that source some quality or benefit not existing at the common law,' they must be given the same meaning and effect when used in the Act of 1916. In adopting the language used in an earlier act Congress must be considered to have adopted also the construction given by this Court to such language, and made it a part of the enactment. Sessions v. Romadka, \n145 \nU.S. 29, 43\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 799; Latimer v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 501, 504\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 242. And here the legislative history of the excise tax provision of the Act of 1916, and the marked contrast between its language and that of the income tax provision of the same Act, plainly show, aside from this rule of statutory construction, that this is what Congress in fact intended. \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 154]\n\u00a0\n We conclude that as the trusts involved in these four cases are not organized under any statute and derive from such source no quality or benefit, they are not within the terms of the excise tax provision of the Act of 1916.\n\n 2. \nRevenue Act of 1918.-Section 1 of this Act provides (40 Stat. p. 1057 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6371 1\/4 a]) that when used in the Act- the 'term 'corporation' includes associations, joint-stock companies, and insurance companies'; the 'term 'domestic' when applied to a corporation or partnership means created or organized in the United States;' and the 'term 'foreign' ... means created or organized outside the United States.'\n Section 1000(a), being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  5980n, provides that in lieu of the tax imposed by section 407 of the Revenue Act of 1916- 'Every domestic corporation shall pay annually a special excise tax with respect to carrying on or doing business,6 equivalent to $1 for each $1, 000 of so much of the fair average value of its capital stock for the preceding year,' including the surplus and undivided profits, as is in excess of $5,000; and every 'foreign corporation shall pay annually a special excise tax with respect to carrying on or doing business in the United States, equivalent to $1 for each $1,000 of the average amount of capital employed in the transaction of its business in the United States during the preceding year.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n By section 1400(a), being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6371 3\/4 a, title 4 of the Revenue Act of 1916-including section 407 relating to excise taxes-is specifically repealed, except for the assessment and collection of taxes accrued thereunder and the imposition and collection of penalties and forfeitures.\n Reading together the defining and enacting sections of the Act it is as if section 1000(a) provided in terms that: Every \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 155]\n\u00a0\n corporation, association, joint-stock company and insurance company, 'created or organized in the United States,' shall pay a special excise tax, as prescribed, with respect to the carrying on or doing business. And it must be given effect as thus read.\n The terms of this Act are in marked and significant contrast with those of the Acts of 1909 and 1916. Not only is the Act of 1916 specifically repealed, but the well-defined words of limitation 'organized under the laws of the United States, or any State or Territory,' that had been used in that Act as well as in the Act of 1909, are omitted; and in lieu thereof the excise tax is extended, broadly, to every 'association' created or organized in the United States and carrying on or doing business therein. And thereby, in our opinion, the intention of Congress is plainly shown to extend the tax from one imposed solely upon organizations exercising statutory privileges, as theretofore, to include also organizations exercising the privilege of doing business as associations at the common law.\n It is true that the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives in a statement as to 'the general principles of the bill'-which included many kinds of taxes-while saying that the committee had made an important change in the rates and exemptions in the capital stock tax, made no reference to any enlargement to the class or organizations to which the tax would apply, and that the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, in reporting on the bill, while stating that it 'provided for the continuance of the capital stock tax on the basis of the fair average value of the capital stock of the corporation,' and made certain changes in rates, likewise made no reference to any such enlargement in the scope of its provisions. 56 Cong. Rec. pt. 12, App. p. 698; 65th Cong. 3d Sess., Sen. Rep. No. 617, p. 17. We cannot, however, regard the slight negative inference which might \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 156]\n\u00a0\n be drawn from the failure of these chairmen to point out the enlargement of the class of organizations made subject to the excise tax, as sufficient to overcome the evidence of the legislative intention drawn from the plain and unambiguous language of the Act itself, emphasized by the contrast with that of the Act of 1916 which it supplanted.\n Nor can we agree with the contention that the definition clause of the Act is not to be held applicable to the excise tax provision on the ground that the Act consolidated many former taxing acts and its general definitions may have been inadvertently extended to the excise tax provision without any actual intention of departing from the language of the former statute in this respect. This is not a mere revision and consolidation of former statutes to which a new interpretation is not to be given without some substantial change in phraseology. McDonald v. Hovey, \n110 U.S. 619\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 142; Buck Stove Co. v. Vickers, \n226 U.S. 205\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 41. It is a new statute, supplanting and changing the former statutes in many respects, and in which there is a significant change of phraseology, incorporated in the general definition clause made applicable, expressly, to every provision of the Act.\n Nor does the language of the Act in this respect call for the application of the established rule that in the interpretation of statutes levying taxes their provisions are not to be extended by implication beyond the clear import of the language used, and in case of doubt are to be construed most strongly against the Government and in favor of the taxpayer. Gould v. Gould, \n245 \nU.S. 151, 153\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 53; United States v. Merriam, \n263 \nU.S. 179, 187\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 69, 68 L. Ed. --. Here the language of the Act is specific, leaving no substantial doubt as to its meaning; and the taxpayers are seeking by implication to limit its clear import.\n\n 3. \nWe also conclude that these three trusts are 'associations' created or organized in the United States and engaged in business, within the meaning of the Act. The trustees of the Hecht and Haymarket Trusts insist that \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 157]\n\u00a0\n they are not such 'associations.' The trustees of the Crocker Association on the other hand admitted in the Circuit Court of Appeals and at the bar, that since the modification of the original trust agreement, the trust constitutes an 'association.'\n The word 'association' appears to be used in the Act in its ordinary meaning. It has been defined as a term 'used throughout the United States to signify a body of persons united without a charter, but upon the methods and forms used by incorporated bodies for the prosecution of some common enterprise.' 1 Abb. Law Dict. 101 (1879); 1 Bouv. Law Dict. ( Rawle's 3d Rev.) 269; 3 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law (2 Ed.) 162; and Allen v. Stevens, 33 App. Div. 485, 54 N. Y. Supp. 8, 23, in which this definition was cited with approval as being in accord with the common understanding. Other definitions are:\n'In the United States, as distinguished from a corporation, a body of persons organized, for the prosecution of some purpose, without a charter, but having the general form and mode of procedure of a corporation.' Webst. New Internat. Dict.\n\n'[U. S.] An organized but unchartered body analogous to but distinguished from a corporation.' Pract. Stand. Dict.\n\n And see Malley v. Bowditch, 259 Fed. 809, 812, 170 C. C. A. 609, 7 A. L. R. 608; Chicago Title Co. v. Smietanka (D. C.) 275 Fed. 60: also United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 392\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 570, 27 A. L. R. 762, in which unincorporated labor unions were held to be 'associations' within the meaning of the Anti-Trust Law.\n We think that the word 'association' as used in the Act clearly includes 'Massachusetts Trusts' such as those herein involved, having quasi-corporate organizations under which they are engaged in carrying on business enterprises. \n8\n What other form of 'associations,' if any, it includes, we need not, and do not, determine. \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 158]\n\u00a0\n It is true that in Eliot v. Freeman, supra, at page 186 (31 Sup. Ct. 361), it was said that the two trusts there involved could 'hardly be said to be organized within the ordinary meaning of that term.' However the decision was based solely upon the ground that they were not subject to the tax imposed by the Act of 1909 because they were not organized under any statute; and the inference from the entire opinion is that if the Act had not required such a statutory organization they would have been held to be within its terms. And we think that the present trusts are both 'created' and 'organized' in the United States within the meaning of the Act.\n The trustees of the Hecht and Haymarket Trusts earnestly rely, however, upon the decision in Crocker v. Malley, supra, as conclusively determining that they cannot be held to be 'associations' unless the trust agreements vest the shareholders with such control over the trustees as to constitute them more than strict trusts within the Massachusetts rule. This case arose under section 2, G(a), of the Income Tax Act of 1913 imposing a tax upon the net income of 'every corporation, joint-stock company or association, ... organized in the United States, no matter how created or organized.' Section 2, D, provided that trustees or other fiduciaries were exempt from \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 159]\n\u00a0\n this tax upon dividends received from corporations taxable upon their net income. The precise question was whether the trustees of The Wachusett Realty Trust were subject to the income tax upon dividends received from a Massachusetts corporation that was itself taxable upon its net income. The trustees insisted that they were not an 'association' subject to this tax, under G(a), but merely trustees and entitled to the exemption as fiduciaries under D. The trust had been created by a Maine corporation which contemplated dissolution, for the benefit of its shareholders. It had transferred to the trustees the fee of certain lands leased to a Massachusetts manufacturing corporation engaged in operating several mills, and also the stock in that corporation which it held. The purpose of the trust was to convert this property into money and distribute the net proceeds to the beneficiaries, within a period left to the discretion of the trustees. Meanwhile they were to distribute the net income, but could apply any funds for the repair and development of the property or the acquisition of other property, pending conversion and distribution. Their function, as emphasized in the opinion, was not to manage the mills, but simply to collect the rents and income, with a large discretion in its application. The beneficiaries had no control except in certain matters in which their consent was required.\n The court, after stating that the declaration of trust on its face was 'an ordinary real estate trust of the kind familiar in Massachusetts,' and that there 'could be little doubt that in Massachusetts this arrangement would be held to create a trust and nothing more,' said that 'as the plaintiffs undeniably are trustees, if they are to be subjected to a double liability the language of the statute must make the intention clear,' and that:\n'It would be a wide departure from normal usage to call the beneficiaries here a joint-stock association when they are admitted not to be partners in any sense, and when they \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 160]\n\u00a0\n have no joint action or interest and no control over the fund. On the other hand, the trustees by themselves cannot be a joint-stock association within the meaning of the act unless all trustees with discretionary powers are such, and the special provision for trustees in D. is to be made meaningless. We perceive no ground for grouping the two-beneficiaries and trustees-together, in order to turn them into an association, by uniting their contrasted functions and powers, although they are in no proper sense associated. ... We presume that the taxation of corporations and joint-stock companies upon dividends of corporations that themselves pay the income tax was for the purpose of discouraging combinations of the kind now in disfavor, by which a corporation holds controlling interests in other corporations which in their turn may control others, and so on, and in this way concentrates a power that is disapproved. There is nothing of that sort here. Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the statute fails to show a clear intent to subject the dividends on the Massachusetts corporation's stock to the extra tax imposed by G(a). '\n\n This opinion is based primarily upon the view that the Income Tax Act, considering its purpose, did not show a clear intention to impose upon the trustees as an 'association' a double liability in reference to the dividends on stock in the corporation that itself paid an income tax, when considered as 'trustees' they were by another provision of the Act exempt from such payment. And the language used arguendo in reaching this conclusion that the trustees could not be deemed an association unless all trustees with discretionary powers are such, and that there was no ground for grouping together the beneficiaries and trustees in order to turn them into an association-is to be read in the light of the trust agreement there involved, under which the trustees were, in substance, merely holding property for the collection of the \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 161]\n\u00a0\n income and its distribution among the beneficiaries, and were not engaged, either by themselves or in connection with the beneficiaries, in the carrying on of any business. Zonne v. Western Syndicate, \n220 \nU.S. 187, 190\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 361. And see Smith v. Anderson, L. R., 15 Ch. Div. 247.\n It results that Crocker v. Malley is not an authority for the broad proposition that under an Act imposing an excise tax upon the privilege of carrying on a business, a Massachusetts Trust engaged in the carrying on of business in a quasi-corporate form, in which the trustees have similar or greater powers than the directors in a corporation, is not an 'association' within the meaning of its provisions.\n We conclude, therefore, that when the nature of the three trusts here involved in considered, as the petitioners are not merely trustees for collecting funds and paying them over, but are associated together in much the same manner as the directors in a corporation for the purpose of carrying on business enterprises, the trusts are to be deemed associations within the meaning of the Act of 1918; this being true independently of the large measure of control exercised by the beneficiaries in the Hecht and Haymarket Cases, which much exceeds that exercised by the beneficiaries under the Wachusett Trust. We do not believe that it was intended that organizations of this character-described as 'associations' by the Massachusetts statutes, and subject to duties and liabilities as such-should be exempt from the excise tax on the privilege of carrying on their business merely because such a slight measure of control may be vested in the beneficiaries that they might be deemed strict trusts within the rule established by the Massachusetts courts.\n That the Crocker Association is engaged in carrying on business within the meaning of the Act, is obvious. And so of the Hecht and Haymarket Trusts. A corporation \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 162]\n\u00a0\n owning and renting an office building is engaged in business within the meaning of an excise statute. Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., supra, page 171 ( 31 Sup. Ct. 342); Zonne v Western Syndicate, supra, at page 190 (31 Sup. Ct. 361).\n\n 4. \nIt is urged, however, by the trustees of the Crocker Association that they are not subject to an excise tax under the Act of 1918, because the tax imposed on a domestic 'association' is measured by 'the fair average value of its capital stock'; the argument being that this tax, of necessity, can apply only to 'associations' having a fixed 'capital stock' represented by shares, that is, a designated share capital whose amount is fixed by the articles of association or trust agreement. Hence, it is insisted, the tax cannot apply to this Association, which, it is claimed, has no 'capital stock' within the meaning of the Act. The trustees of the Hecht Trust do not make this contention.\n The certificates in this Association, as stated, have no par value; the shares being for ninety-six thousandths of the beneficial interest in the property. No 'capital' account is kept by the trustees; but they have a profit and loss account, in which they are charged with all the property transferred to them, at a valuation, against which liabilities and reserves are shown, the balance being carried as the net interest of the shareholders. And their books show the 'dividends' disbursed to shareholders. The amount of the present tax was assessed by the Collector by taking the fair value of the assets of the Association over its liabilities, and calling the difference its capital stock.\n It is true that, generally speaking, in the technical sense, the capital stock of a corporation is a sum fixed by its corporate charter as the amount paid or to be paid in by the stockholders for the prosecution of the business of the corporation and the benefit of its creditors. 1 Cook on Corporations (7th Ed.) 38, and cases cited in note 2. \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 163]\n\u00a0\n However, in statutes relating to taxation, sometimes drawn without regard to the technical meaning of the words, the courts will construe 'capital stock' to mean the actual property of the corporation, when necessary to carry out the intent of the statute. Id. p. 39; Security Co. v. Hartford, 61 Conn. 89, 101, 23 Atl. 699; Henderson Bridge Co. v. Commonwealth, 99 Ky. 623, 641, 31 S. W. 486, 29 L. R. A. 78. And see People v. Coleman, 126 N. Y. 433, 439, 27 N. E. 818, 12 L. R. A. 762.\n We think that in the Act of 1918, in which the tax upon an association is based upon the average value of its 'capital stock,' including surplus and undivided profits, these words are not to be given a technical meaning, but should be interpreted, in their entirety, and, in the absence of a fixed share capital, as equivalent to the capital invested in the business, that is, the net value of the property owned by the association and used in its business. As was said by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the phrase in the statute as to 'including surplus and undivided profits puts beyond doubt the question of the congressional intent to measure this tax by business and financial realties, not by bookkeeping forms or mere names.' And this construction is in harmony with the provision as to the excise tax on a foreign association, which is fixed upon the value 'of its capital actually invested in the transactions of its business in the United States.'\n We therefore conclude that the Crocker Association was also subject to the tax, and that this was properly measured by the Collector by the net value of its property-no question being made as to the correctness of his valuation.\n\n 5. \nA question remains in Cases Nos. 100 and 119-which has not been argued by counsel-as to the taxes for the years ending June 30, 1919, which were assessed against the trustees of the Haymarket Trust and the Crocker Association under the Act of 1916, and paid by them before the passage of the Act of 1918. The latter Act, which was approved and became effective February \n\n[265 U.S. 144, 164]\n\u00a0\n 24, 1919, was retroactive in its provisions and covered the year ending June 30, 1919 (40 Stat. at page 1126). Thereafter additional taxes were assessed against the trustees, representing the differences between the amount of the taxes which they had paid under the Act of 1916 and those prescribed by the Act of 1918. See note 2, supra.\n In view of the retroactive provision of the Act of 1918, we are of opinion that the taxes for the year ending June 30, 1919, cannot now be recovered, even though originally their assessment under the Act of 1916 was unauthorized, since they thereafter became due under the Act of 1918; and that they may now be retained by the United States. See Anderson v. Loan & Trust Co., 241 Fed. 322, 325, 154 C. C. A. 202, and New York Life Ins. Co. v. Anderson, 263 Fed. 527, 530; also Crocker v. Malley, supra, at page 235 (39 Sup. Ct. 270).\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals are accordingly affirmed in cases Nos. 100, 101, and 119; and in No. 99 affirmed as to the taxes assessed for the years ending June 30, 1919, and June 30, 1920, and reversed as to those assessed for the six months ending June 30, 1917, and the year ending June 30, 1918.\n Affirmed in part.\n Reversed in part.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The date of this Act is February 24, 1919. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] In No. 99 the trustees of the Hecht Trust were assessed under the Act of 1916 with taxes for the six months ending June 30, 1917, and the year ending June 30, 1918; and under the Act of 1918 for the years ending June 30, 1919, and June 30, 1920. In No. 100 the trustees of the Haymarket Trust were assessed under the Act of 1916 with a tax for the year ending June 30, 1919; and in No. 101 they were assessed under the Act of 1918 with an additional tax for the year ending June 30, 1919, and a tax for the year ending June 30, 1920. In No. 119 the trustees of the Crocker Association were assessed under the Act of 1916 with a tax for the year ending June 30, 1919, and under the Act of 1918 with an additional tax for the same year. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Such trusts also exist in other States. See generally, as to their characteristics, Sears' Trust Estates as Business Companies and Wrightington's Unincorporated Associations. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] By chapter 441 of the Acts of 1909,  1, the trustees of 'a voluntary association under a written instrument or declaration of trust the beneficial interest under which is divided into transferable certificates of participation or shares,' are required to file copies of the instrument of trust with designated public officers; and by chapter 184 of the Acts of 1916, such associations may be sued for debts, obligations, or liabilities, and their property may be subjected to attachment and execution as if they were corporation.

One might almost say that they are a device under which parties make their own corporation code. Business concerns so organized have come to occupy a large field in industry and in finance. At least two substantial text-books have been written on the law concerning such organizations and dealing with their advantages for general business purposes. ... In Dana v. Treasurer, 227 Mass. 562, 565, 116 N. E. 941, it appears that the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, commonly known to be one of the largest enterprises in New England, is so organized. The Pepperell Manufacturing Company, before this court in Malley v. Bowditch, supra, had a capitalization of over $7,500,000; the Crocker Trust operates large paper manufacturing mills, employing about 1, 000 men, with gross assets of over $10,000,000.' 281 Fed. at page 370. \n\n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHESTER v. U S(1924)\nNo. 243\nArgued: Decided: May 5, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Richard A. Ford, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error, Hester, was convicted of concealing distilled spirits, etc., under Rev. St.  3296 (Comp. St.  6038). The case is brought here directly from the District Court on the single ground that by refusing to exclude the testimony of two witnesses and to direct a verdict for the defendant, the plaintiff in error, the Court violated his \n\n[265 U.S. 57, 58]\n\u00a0\n rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.\n The witnesses whose testimony is objected to were revenue officers. In consequence of information they went toward the house of Hester's father, where the plaintiff in error lived, and as they approached saw one Henderson drive near to the house. They concealed themselves from fifty to one hundred yards away and saw Hester come out and hand Henderson a quart bottle. An alarm was given. Hester went to a car standing near, took a gallon jug from it and he and Henderson ran. One of the officers pursued, and fired a pistol. Hester dropped his jug, which broke but kept about a quart of its contents. Henderson threw away his bottle also. The jug and bottle both contained what the officers, being experts, recognized as moonshine whisky, that is, whisky illicitly distilled; said to be easily recognizable. The other officer entered the house, but being told there was no whisky there left it, but found outside a jar that had been thrown out and broken and that also contained whisky. While the officers were there other cars stopped at the house but were spoken to by Hester's father and drove off. The officers had no warrant for search or arrest, and it is contended that this made their evidence inadmissible, it being assumed, on the strength of the pursuing officer's saying that he supposed they were on Hester's land, that such was the fact. It is obvious that even if there had been a trespass, the above testimony was not obtained by an illegal search or seizure. The defendant's own acts, and those of his associates, disclosed the jug, the jar and the bottle-and there was no seizure in the sense of the law when the officers examined the contents of each after it had been abandoned. This evidence was not obtained by the entry into the house and it is immaterial to discuss that. The suggestion that the defendant was compelled to give evidence against himself \n\n[265 U.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n does not require an answer. The only shadow of a ground for bringing up the case is drawn from the hypothesis that the examination of the vessels took place upon Hester's father's land. As to that, it is enough to say that, apart from the justification, the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their 'persons, houses, papers and effects,' is not extended to the open fields. The distinction between the latter and the house is as old as the common law. 4 Bl. Comm. 223, 225, 226.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHETRICK v. VILLAGE OF LINDSEY, OHIO(1924)\nNo. 231\nArgued: April 23, 1924Decided: June 2, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Albert H. Fry, of Fremont, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. W. J. Mead, of Fremont, Ohio, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Hetrick owned two lots in the village of Lindsey, Ohio, No. 175 and No. 176. He brought suit in the common pleas court of Sandusky county against the village and the auditor and treasurer of the county, to enjoin the collection of front foot street assessments levied by the village council against the two lots. He contended, first, that the assessment exceeded the benefits to the lots or either of them; second, that the assessment was in excess of the limit allowed by law to be levied upon property \n\n[265 U.S. 384, 385]\n\u00a0\n for local improvement, which by the statute was one-third of its value; third, that the assessment was in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in that there was no provision for notice to be given to the owner of the property to be assessed and an opportunity to be heard before the tax was levied.\n Evidence was taken on the question of benefits and the value of the lots. The common pleas court sustained the assessment in its entirety and dismissed the petition. The plaintiff then appealed to the Court of Appeals of the county and the case was reheard by that court on new evidence. Section 3819 of the General Code of Ohio in part is as follows:\n'The council shall limit all assessments to the special benefits conferred upon the property assessed, and in no case shall there be levied upon any lot or parcel of land in the corporation any assessment or assessments for any or all purposes, within a period of five years, to exceed thirty-three and one-third per cent. of the actual value thereof after improvement is made.'\n\n The Court of Appeals found that the value of the lots, after the completion of the improvement, was $2,600, and that they were especially benefited to the extent of one-third of this value, reduced the assessments from $1,040.60 on both lots to $866.67, and enjoined the collection of more than this amount. The Court of Appeals found other facts as follows:\n Notice of the passage of the resolution of necessity for the improvement had been served by the clerk of the council in writing on the plaintiff personally within the time required by the statute. He had full knowledge of the work as it progressed and made no objection thereto. He appeared with his counsel before the village council, consulted with it as to the manner of the construction of the improvement and succeeded in having its character \n\n[265 U.S. 384, 386]\n\u00a0\n changed in front of his property to conform to his desire. He never requested a hearing before the council on the public necessity of the improvement or the validity or amount of the assessment.\n In due time after the decree in the Court of Appeals, plaintiff filed a petition in error in the Supreme Court of the state. The defendants made a motion to dismiss it, on the ground that no leave to file it had been granted. The plaintiff claimed that no leave was necessary under the state practice, because the case involved a question under the Constitution of the United States as to the validity of the statutes of the state relating to special assessments for street improvements. The defendants answered that such statutes had been so long held constitutional by the courts of the state that their constitutionality could no longer be questioned, and therefore that the petition should be dismissed, presumably as frivolous. The court sustained the motion and dismissed the petition. A writ of error to bring the case here was allowed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the state.\n The decision of fact by the state Court of Appeals that the assessment did not exceed the benefit to the property and that it did not exceed one-third of the value of the property after the improvement was completed, are not questioned here. The only point of contention made is that the Ohio statutes relating to special assessments for street improvements do not require a notice to, and a hearing on behalf of, the owner of the property assessed by the village council, and therefore permit the owner to be deprived of his property without due process of law.\n Section 12075 of the General Code of Ohio has for many years provided as follows:\n'Common pleas and superior courts may enjoin the illegal levy or collection of taxes and assessments, and entertain \n\n[265 U.S. 384, 387]\n\u00a0\n actions to recover them back when collected, without regard to the amount thereof, but no recovery shall be had unless the action be brought within one year after the taxes or assessments are collected.'\n\n Under this section the plaintiff had two full hearings in two courts upon the merits of the assessments, that is, upon the question whether the special benefits conferred were greater than the value of the property; and, second, whether the assessment exceeded one-third of the value of the property. This is in accord with the previous decisions of the Supreme Court of Ohio in reference to the power of the state courts in passing on the validity of assessments either in a suit to collect the same or in a suit by the assessment payer to enjoin them. Walsh et al. v. Sims, Treasurer, et al., 65 Ohio St. 211, 62 N. E. 120; Griswold v. Pelton, Treasurer, 34 Ohio St. 482. It thus appears that the plaintiff in this case had had opportunity by contesting the assessment in court to review all the questions of law and fact as to the validity and fairness of the assessment under the statutes of Ohio, that these facts were passed upon by the court and that the plaintiff had secured from that court a reduction of the assessment.

St. Ann. Supp. 1923 ,  10138 1\/4 et seq.).\n Having declared, 'The single question presented for decision is whether the ordinance, in so far as it relates to the filling of prescriptions by licensed pharmacists, is valid and enforceable since the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment and the enactment of the National Prohibition Law, commonly known as the Volstead Act,' \n\n[265 U.S. 254, 256]\n\u00a0\n the District Court of Appeal affirmed the validity of the ordinance and remanded plaintiff in error. Thereupon he sued out this writ of error. The assignment of errors alleges a conflict between the ordinance and the Fourteenth as well as the Eighteenth Amendment.\n The petition for habeas corpus did not mention the Fourteenth Amendment. The opinion of the court below indicates it was there maintained that Congress by the Volstead Act granted some right or privilege which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and may not be abridged by state or municipality.\n We do not stop to decide whether, considering plaintiff in error's clear right through a new petition to secure from the Supreme Court of California an unembarrassed determination of the question presented below ( Matter of Zany, 164 Cal. 724, 130 Pac. 710), the assailed judgment is one 'in the highest court of a state in which a decision in the suit court be had,' within section 237, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214). It is enough now to say that he has failed to raise any substantial federal question, and for that reason the writ of error must be dismissed. Neither the Eighteenth Amendment nor the Volstead Act grants the right to sell intoxicating liquors within a state. And certainly nothing in that act lends color to the suggestion that it endows a pharmacist with the right to dispense liquors for which he may claim the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n We go no further than to consider the points definitely raised upon the record and dispose of the present writ.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOFFMAN v. MCCLELLAND(1924)\nNo. 190\nArgued: January 23, 1924Decided: April 21, 1924\n\n\n\n Messrs. Tom Connally, of Washington, D. C., and James D. Williamson, of Waco, Tex., for appellants.\n\n\n[264 U.S. 552, 554]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph M. McCormick, of Dallas, Tex., for appellees. \n\n[264 U.S. 552, 555]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the District Court for the Western District of Texas refusing leave to file a bill proffered as a petition of intervention in a designated suit in that court. The appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals and was by that court transferred here according to section 238a of the Judicial Code (42 Stat. 837, c. 305 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1215a]), on the ground that it should have been taken directly to this court under section 238 (Comp. St.  1215), 284 Fed. 837.\n The suit in which intervention was sought already had been prosecuted to a final decree; but the decree contained a provision whereby jurisdiction was retained for limited purposes, one of which will be hereinafter shown. The suit arose out of conflicting claims asserted under the will of Peter McClelland, Sr., a resident of McLennan county, in the Western district of Texas, who died in 1886, seized of valuable real property in that county. The will put the property in a so-called spendthrift trust, of which Peter McClelland, Jr., the testator's son and only child, was the beneficiary. Through an order of the state court in McLennan county, John K. Rose, a citizen of Texas, became the substituted trustee under the will, and as such was holding the property and administering the trust when the suit was begun. The son, who was a citizen of California, was the plaintiff, and the substituted trustee and the testator's collateral kin were the defendants. Diverse citizenship was the sole basis of the District Court's jurisdiction. The object of the suit was to obtain a construction of the will, to have that construction made binding on the trustee, and to establish the son's ownership, subject to the trust, of all the property as against the collateral kin. The proceedings and the decree are shown in McClelland v. Rose, 208 Fed. 503, 125 C. C. A. 505, 222 Fed. 67, 137 C. C. A. 519, and 247 Fed. 721, 159 C. C. A. 579, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 341, and Rose v. McClelland, \n241 U.S. 668\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 552. The decree determined that the trust was to continue \n\n[264 U.S. 552, 556]\n\u00a0\n for the natural life of the son; that the trustee was to hold the property, collect the rents, and make discretionary advances to the son during that period, and that the son was the true and sole owner, subject to the trust, of all the property. One paragraph of the decree read as follows:\n'It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court that the said John K. Rose, as substitute trustee aforesaid, may, without further order of this court, make from time to time such advances to the said plaintiff, Peter McClelland, Jr., not to exceed the net revenues and income from the said estate, as he may think right and proper, but no portion of the corpus of the said estate shall be delivered to, or be surrendered over during the lifetime of the plaintiff to the said plaintiff, or his vendees, except upon the further order of this court; and this court hereby retains jurisdiction of this cause to the end that it may, from time to time as occasion may require, exercise its power of direction and control over said trustee in this respect.'\n\n The persons who sought to intervene were creditors of the son and were citizens of Texas. They had brought an action on their claim in the state court for McLennan county, had caused a writ of attachment to be issued in that action and levied on part of the real property in the possession of the trustee, and had prosecuted the action to a judgment directing that the son's interest in the attached property be sold to satisfy their claim. The son had not been served with process in that action, nor had he appeared therein; so the judgment had no force save such as may have arisen from the attachment. Afterwards, in a suit by the trustee against the attaching creditors and the sheriff, the same state court granted a permanent injunction against a sale under the judgment-the grounds assigned for granting the injunction being that the son's interest in the property could not be \n\n[264 U.S. 552, 557]\n\u00a0\n sold to pay his debts while he was living, and that the trustee was entitled to prevent such a sale in the son's lifetime, even though there was no purpose to disturb the trustee's possession or the administration of the trust. On an appeal to the Court of Civil Appeals that decision was affirmed, Hoffman v. Rose, 217 S. W. 424, and an application for a further review was denied by the Supreme Court of the state.\n It was after these proceedings that the creditors sought to intervene in the suit in the District Court. They set forth in their proffered bill all that was done in the state court, including the attachment and judgment and the subsequent injunction, and also alleged that by the attachment and judgment they had acquired a lien on the attached property which was in no way avoided or affected by the injunction; that by the prior proceedings in the District Court the property had been drawn into that court's custody and control and thereby effectually impounded; that they had no means of enforcing their lien during the life of the son, save through the interposition and aid of the District Court; that the lien probably would be lost unless that court recognized and protected it, and that to postpone its enforcement until after the death of the son would not be equitable. The relief prayed was that the lien be recognized and protected, and the remainder interest of the son in the attached property be ordered sold under the lien to satisfy their claim.\n In refusing leave to file the bill the District Court put its decision on the ground that it was without jurisdiction to entertain the bill, in that (a) the bill was not ancillary or dependent in the sense that it could be entertained in virtue of the jurisdiction acquired in the earlier suit; and (b) the citizenship of the parties and the nature of the matter presented were not such that the bill could be dealt with as an original and independent bill.\n As leave to file the bill was not refused as a matter of discretion, but on the theory that there was no basis on \n\n[264 U.S. 552, 558]\n\u00a0\n which the court, as a federal tribunal, could proceed to an adjudication of the matter presented, it is apparent that the petitioning creditors were shut out on a jurisdictional ground in the sense of section 238 of the Judicial Code, and so were entitled to bring that ruling here for review by a direct appeal.\n The record makes it plain and counsel agree that there was an absence of jurisdictional requisites for dealing with the bill as an original and independent bill; so we come at once to the question whether it could be entertained as an ancillary or dependent bill\n It is settled that where, in the progress of a suit in a federal court, property has been drawn into the court's custody and control, third persons claiming interest in or liens upon the property may be permitted to come into that court for the purpose of setting up, protecting, and enforcing their claims, although the court could not consider or adjudicate their claims if it had not impounded the property. Power to deal with such claims is incident to the jurisdiction acquired in the suit wherein the impounding occurs, and may be invoked by a petition to intervene pro interesse suo or by a dependent bill. But in either case the proceeding is purely ancillary. Oklahoma v. Texas, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 581\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 406; Minnesota Co. v. St. Paul Co., 2 Wall. 609, 632; Krippendorf v. Hyde, \n110 \nU.S. 276, 281\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 27; Compton v. Jesup, 68 Fed. 263, 279, 15 C. C. A. 397; Sioux City Co. v. Trust Co., 82 Fed. 124, 128, 27 C. C. A. 73; Minot v. Mastin, 95 Fed. 734, 739, 37 C. C. A. 234; Street, Fed. Eq. Pr.  1229, 1245-1247, 1364\n\n\n The proffered bill shows that it was drafted to obtain the benefit of that rule, and, if its allegations were all that could be considered, there might be good ground for thinking it could be entertained in virtue of the jurisdiction acquired in the earlier suit. But the bill did not rightly state the nature and effect of the proceedings in that suit, and of course the District Court could not accept a mistaken description or characterization of them, \n\n[264 U.S. 552, 559]\n\u00a0\n but was required to give effect to what its own records disclosed. The pleadings, orders and decree in that suit, which were before the court at the time, are set forth in the present record, and they show that the property was not impounded in that suit. The trustee, who was holding the property and administering the trust, was not an appointee of the District Court, but of the state court of McLennan county. The District Court had not taken over the administration of the trust, nor had it otherwise drawn unto itself the custody and control of the property. It had determined a controversy between the son on the one hand and the trustee and the collateral kin on the other respecting the nature and duration of the trust; had adjudged that, subject to the trust, the son was the true and sole owner of the property and that the collateral kin had no interest therein; had prohibited the trustee from delivering or surrendering any part of the corpus of the estate to the son, or his vendees, during his lifetime, except on its order, and had retained jurisdiction of the suit, to the end that it might compel full adherence to that prohibition. But it did not acquire or assume any other power of direction or control over the property, nor did it withdraw the son's remainder interest in the property from the reach of process issuing from other courts. The petitioning creditors evidently proceeded on this view throughout the proceedings in the state court, for they not only caused a part of the property to be attached under process issued from that court but sought to have the son's remainder interest in it sold under such process without asking the leave of the District Court. True, the sale was prevented by an injunction, but that was because the state court which granted the injunction was of opinion that under the provisions of the will such a sale during the son's life would be inadmissible and ineffectual, and not because it regarded the property as impounded by the proceedings in the District Court. Only after they had \n\n[264 U.S. 552, 560]\n\u00a0\n met with that decision in the state court did the creditors conclude to resort to the District Court. Even if that decision was wrong, as they seem to think, it did not change or affect the situation in the District Court.\n In our opinion the bill could not be entertained as an ancillary or dependent bill.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOME TEL. & TEL.

Ct. 553, 68 L. Ed. --. The bill averred that the plaintiff was a corporation of Washington, owning and operating a telephone system in the city of Spokane and territory adjacent thereto, known as the Spokane Exchange; that on September 20, 1922, it filed with the Department of Public Works a schedule of rates by which those of 1919 as approved in that year by the Public Service Commission, the predecessor of the Department of Public Works, were substantially increased; that the Department suspended the new rates, and March 31, 1923, finally denied the company its application for increase, thereby limiting it to prior rates alleged to be confiscatory in character. In detail, the bill set out the cost of the Spokane system at over $4,000,000 and its present value at $5,710.684, and averred that a fair return thereon would be 8 per cent.; that the actual return therefrom had been:\n On Cost. On Fair Value. Year 1919 2.95% 2.14% Year 1920 1.79% 1.30% Year 1921 2.35% 1.71% Year 1922 3.07% 2.28% \n\n[265 U.S. 206, 208]\n\u00a0\n and that the order of March 31, 1923, by which an increase of rates had been denied operated to limit it to the prior rates which it alleged were and would continue to be confiscatory. The prayer was for a temporary and permanent injunction.\n These appeals were heard at the same time with the two just disposed of in the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. Case, and the same orders were made therein by the District Court. There is no difference in the cases except that on the motion for a temporary injunction an affidavit of the assistant corporation counsel of Spokane was filed, which set forth, among other reasons for denying an injunction, an ordinance of the city of Spokane of April, 1909, in which rates for telephone service by the Home Telephone Company in that city were fixed in a schedule much lower than the one said to be necessary for a fair return, and alleged that the ordinance was still in full force and effect, was a valid contract between the city and the company, and that thus the bill of the plaintiff must fail. Upon argument and brief in this court counsel for the company insist that under the decision of the Supreme Court of Washington in State ex rel. Spokane Falls Gaslight Co. v. Kuykendall, 119 Wash. 107, 205 Pac. 3, action of the city in reducing the rates of the ordinance in 1913 and increasing them in 1919 must be held to terminate the contract of the ordinance and bring the rates within the regulation of the Public Service Commission or its successor, the Department of Public Works.\n It is obvious that upon this appeal we could not safely pass upon an issue raised upon an affidavit and not shown in the bill. The temporary injunction was denied and the bill was dismissed by the District Court on the same ground as that explained at length in the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company. For the same reasons as therein stated, we must dismiss the appeal in No. 539 as \n\n[265 U.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n merged in No. 790, and reverse the District Court in the latter appeal, and remand the case for further proceedings, when, upon answer and the merits, the effect of the ordinance referred to and other questions raised in the affidavit can be fully considered.\n Reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","73":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOUSE v.

No. 5.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Both of these writs must be dismissed. \n No. 92.\n\n The only ground suggested to sustain the writ in this cause is that Act No. 245, Arkansas Legislature of 1919, which established road district No. 2 of Conway county, was duly challenged as repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment. Such a challenge must be distinct and substantial.\n The act undertook to create the district with boundaries which include plaintiff's lands and specified the proceedings for assessing benefits to meet necessary costs. Her lands were assessed as provided. Some months thereafter, by a bill in equity, she claimed insufficient notice and asked relief from both assessment and consequent \n\n[266 U.S. 175, 177]\n\u00a0\n penalties; also that the commissioner's plans should be declared null and she be heard as to the merits of any assessment. She offered to pay any sum the court might find just and equitable.\n The bill alleges that the statute authorized and the commissioners gave only 17 days' notice of the assessment, by publication, that she had no actual notice, and that the publication failed sufficiently to describe her lands. For these reasons she maintained the act did not provide due process of law and violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The Supreme Court, having considered the objections, held that the statute allowed twenty-eight days after the first publication during which time petitioner might have objected to the assessment, and declared this was adequate; also that when read in connection with the statute the notice sufficiently described the lands. Plaintiff in error now insists that the act is null because it prescribes insufficient notice and description of the assessed lands.\n Accepting the statute as construed by the state court, the suggested objections to its validity appear to us wholly wanting in merit.\n No. 93.\n This cause grew out of the creation of district No. 5, Conway county, by act No. 245, and assessment for benefits thereunder. With one exception the questions now raised are the same as those in cause No. 92. As an additional ground for challenging the statute plaintiff in error claims that it is arbitrary and beyond the power of the Legislature because the proposed improvement could not benefit plaintiff's lands, while other lands actually benefited were not included. The record does not show that this objection was placed upon any federal ground in the courts below; but, assuming that the point was properly made, we think it is clearly without merit. \n\n[266 U.S. 175, 178]\n\u00a0\n Houck v.

St.  4685). The other appellants in No. 324 (appellees in No. 336) are trustees for bondholders of the Irrigation Company and certain intervening individual owners of land, who had purchased water rights after this suit was brought and a lis pendens filed. Appellees (appellants in No. 336) are individual owners of water rights, purchased from the Irrigation Company under the Carey Act, and the state of Idaho, which intervened as a party plaintiff.\n The water rights are represented by shares of stock in the Big Wood River Reservoir & Canal Company, organized as an operating company by the Irrigation Company in pursuance of contracts with the state of Idaho.\n The suit, brought in a state court and removed to the federal District Court, was to enjoin the Irrigation Company and the trustees from selling, disposing of, or transferring upon the books of the company any shares of the Reservoir & Canal Company held as assets of the Irrigation Company or as trustees for the benefit of bondholders, and to enjoin the Irrigation Company from making further contracts for the sale of water rights, or selling, disposing of, or transferring any shares of the Reservoir \n\n[265 U.S. 518, 521]\n\u00a0\n & Canal Company which the Irrigation Company owned or controlled.\n By the Carey Act the United States binds itself to donate, grant, and patent to a state, complying with stated conditions, desert lands, which the state may cause to be irrigated, reclaimed, and occupied. The state is required to file a map of the land proposed to be irrigated, showing the plan of irrigation, etc., and is authorized to make contracts, to cause the lands to be reclaimed, and to induce their settlement and cultivation. Upon satisfactory proof the Secretary of the Interior is directed to issue patents to the state or its assigns. In pursuance of the Carey Act and of its own statutes to carry that act into effect, Comp. Stats. Idaho 1919, p. 848, c. 136, the state of Idaho entered into contracts with the Irrigation Company for the reclamation of approximately 167,000 acres of land, and the company entered into contracts with appellees and other settlers to furnish water for lands to be acquired by them in the project, to be represented by shares of stock in the Reservoir & Canal Company.\n By these contracts, made on January 2, 1909 and prior dates the Irrigation Company, understood to be the owner of the right to divert 6, 000 cubic feet per second of time of water, agreed that it would furnish and deliver to the owners of such shares all of the appropriated waters to the extent of one-eightieth of a cubic foot per second of time per acre, and that water rights or shares should not be sold beyond the carrying capacity of the canal system or in excess of the waters appropriated. Shares of stock of the Reservoir & Canal Company were to be issued in the proportion of one share for each one-eightieth of a cubic foot per second of time. It was further agreed that the irrigation works should be completed within five years from the date of the contracts, at which time the obligation to furnish the full one-eightieth \n\n[265 U.S. 518, 522]\n\u00a0\n of a cubic foot per second of time per acre should be in force and effect.\n Upon application of the state of Idaho and evidence to the effect that an ample supply of water was actually furnished and in sufficient quantity to reclaim the lands as contemplated by the Carey Act, the Secretary of the Interior fixed the area of the project at 117,677.24 acres and caused a patent of the United States therefor to be issued and delivered to the state.\n The injunction was sought upon the ground that the water, appropriated and available, was wholly insufficient to irrigate the entire area, and was no more than sufficient to irrigate 40,939 acres, and that water rights had been sold for lands largely in excess of this area. A lis pendens was filed for record in the various counties where the property was situated, which had the effect of imparting constructive notice to all of the pendency of the suit. Comp. Stats. 1919,  6674. The answer of the Irrigation Company alleges that water right shares had been sold for more than 87,000 acres; that the supply of water appropriated and available was sufficient for the lands represented by these shares and over 25,000 acres in addition. The answer avers as a further defense that the action of the state and of the Secretary of the Interior and the issuance of the patent thereon constituted a determination by the state of Idaho and the Secretary of the Interior that the water supply and the capacity of the irrigation works were sufficient, and that this was binding and conclusive in the case.\n It was stipulated at the trial that the total outstanding shares of the Reservoir & Canal Company were 88,135.71. Of these 12,722.64 shares, originally sold to individuals, had been purchased by the trustees at foreclosure sale, out of which 3,143.61 shares were sold to the interveners after the commencement of the suit and the filing of the lis pendens. \n\n[265 U.S. 518, 523]\n\u00a0\n The District Court took evidence in open court under equity rule 46 and delivered an opinion in favor of appellees, upon which a decree was entered. It determined from the evidence that the reasonable duty of water was 2 3\/4 acre feet per acre for the entire area, without deduction for roads or other nonirrigable tracts; and, without attempting to determine the exact quantity of available water, found that the supply was and would continue to be insufficient to meet the demands of the outstanding contracts, exclusive of those which the company had acquired through foreclosure proceedings. These findings have support in the evidence and the conclusion is justified that the available water will fall short of supplying as much as 50,000 acres of land. The allowance of 2 3\/4 acre feet per acre is much less than the quantity stipulated in the contract, but the reduction by the court was properly made under the Idaho statute, which requires that the amount of water allowed shall never be in excess of the amount used for beneficial purposes. Comp. Stats. 1919,  7033; and the statute which forbids the use by any water right owner of more water than good husbandry requires. Section 5640. These provisions are to be read into the contracts. State v. Twin Falls, etc., Water Co., 30 Idaho, 41, 77, 166 Pac. 220. By statute it was made unlawful for the Irrigation Company to contract to sell more water than it had. Section 5636; State v. Twin Falls, etc. Co., supra, 65 (166 Pac. 220); Gerber v. Nampa, etc., Irrigation District, 16 Idaho 1, 17, 100 Pac. 80.\n We cannot accept the contention of appellants that the application of the state and the issuance thereon of a patent to the lands by the Secretary of the Interior constituted a determination binding on the individual water right owners that an ample supply of water was available for the entire 117,677.24 acres. Whatever may be the effect of this action as between the United States and the state of Idaho, it is perfectly clear that it can have no \n\n[265 U.S. 518, 524]\n\u00a0\n effect upon the rights of the individual land and water owners. Their rights are to be measured by the contracts, and by these contracts the Irrigation Company bound itself to furnish one-eightieth of a cubic foot per second of time per acre. We fully agree with the District Court that the individual appellees, not being parties to these proceedings, are not bound by them, and in saying:\n'They hold contracts imposing upon them heavy obligations and in turn conferring upon them valuable rights. It would be shocking to hold that these rights could be taken away or substantially impaired by a finding of fact or conclusion of law (we are not advised which) made by an administrative officer in an ex parte proceeding in which they did not have an opportunity to be heard.'\n\n See, also, Twin Falls Oakley Land & Water Co. v. Martens (C. C. A.) 271 Fed. 428, 433.\n As among the individual owners the water rights conveyed by the Irrigation Company are vested and under the contracts must be shared proportionately; but the Irrigation Company is without right to continue to contract to sell and deliver water from a supply that has already been exhausted, thereby compelling these owners to still further diminish their proportionate rights. As said by the Supreme Court of Idaho in Sanderson v. Salmon River Canal Co., 34 Idaho 303, 310, 200 Pac. 341, 343 (26 A. L. R. 292):\n'It is one thing to prevent any more rights vesting, in order to avoid a hardship to those whose rights have already vested, and it is another thing to wipe out rights which have already vested through the issuance of contracts and the use of the water.'\n\n See State v. Twin Falls Land & Water Co. (Idaho), 217 Pac. 252, 256; Boley v. Twin Falls Canal Co. (Idaho), 217 Pac. 258, 262, 263; Caldwell v. Twin Falls, etc., Co. (D. C.) 225 Fed. 584, 592-595.\n We think the District Court was also right in including in the injunction the 12,722.64 shares of stock purchased by the trustees at foreclosure sale. These shares were \n\n[265 U.S. 518, 525]\n\u00a0\n the property of the Irrigation Company, and, representing an excess of available water supply, should be extinguished and their resale enjoined. They are subject to the same principle that was applied to the issuance and sale of additional original shares in excess of such supply. The conclusion of the District Court was based upon the theory that the ownership and control of these shares were in the Irrigation Company and this is supported by the evidence. Indeed, it was so stipulated between counsel at the trial. See Childs v. Neitzel, 26 Idaho, 116, 127, 129-131, 141 Pac. 77.\n The Court of Appeals, however, held that the decree of the District Court in this respect was erroneous to the extent of 5,322.26 shares, which were appurtenant to the lands owned by the Irrigation Company and its trustees when the suit was commenced and lis pendens filed; but we are unable to see that these shares occupy any different status from the others. The stipulation of ownership and control included all. If the injunction was bad as to the 5,322.26 shares, it was bad as to all. The Irrigation Company, having oversold the available water supply, exclusive of the shares purchased at foreclosure sale, cannot be permitted to sell additional shares, whether still unissued, or issued and sold, but reacquired, and whether acquired before the suit and lis pendens or afterwards. It may be conceded that the water rights represented by these shares were appurtenant to the lands for the irrigation of which they had been acquired, Comp. Stats. Idaho,  3018; but they were not, under the Carey Act and the laws of Idaho, inseparably appurtenant to the lands, but constituted distinct and separably property rights. Bennett v. Twin Falls, etc., Co., 27 Idaho, 643, 653, 150 Pac. 336. To permit the use and enjoyment of these water rights by the Irrigation Company, with the consequent further reduction of individual rights purchased from the company, would be to ignore the distinction between the wrongdoer \n\n[265 U.S. 518, 526]\n\u00a0\n and the innocent, and is not to be suffered by a court of equity.\n In so far as the decree of the Court of Appeals agrees with that of the District Court it is affirmed; but in respect of the matter last discussed it is reversed and the decree of the District Court affirmed in all particulars. \n No. 324\n affirmed.\n No. 336, reversed. \n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIDE v.

Howell, all of Cheyenne, Wyo., and M. A. Rattigan, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the United States to enjoin threatened interference with changes which it is making in a natural ravine, called Bitter creek, in the course of completing and perfecting an irrigation system known as the Shoshone Project. The changes consist in so straightening, widening and deepening the ravine that it may be utilized as a ditch to collect seepage from project irrigation and to carry the water so collected to other lands for further use in their irrigation. The defendants severally own small tracts of land within the project which are either crossed by or adjacent to the ravine, and some claim to have appropriated water in the ravine for the irrigation of their tracts. All, in their \n\n[263 U.S. 497, 499]\n\u00a0\n answers, challenge the plaintiff's right to make the changes-some on the ground that the work involves a trespass on their tracts, and others on the ground that it involves a destruction of their asserted appropriations- and on these grounds they ask affirmative relief.\n After a hearing the District Court entered a decree for the defendants. In the Circuit Court of Appeals that decree was reversed with a direction to enter one for the plaintiff. United States v. Ide, 277 Fed. 373. The defendants then appealed to this court.\n The project is a very large one, and was undertaken in accordance with the National Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902, c. 1093, 32 Stat. 388 ( Comp. St.  4700 et seq.). It was formally approved in 1904, work on it was begun promptly, and parts of it are now nearing completion. It comprehends the impounding of the waters of the Shoshone river and the use of many tunnels, canals and laterals in carrying and applying them to large bodies of public land, all naturally arid and susceptible of cultivation only when irrigated. The lands are disposed of in small tracts as the work progresses, each disposal carrying with it a perpetual right to water from the project canals. The terms of disposal are such that the cost of construction and maintenance ultimately will be borne by the purchasers. There are also provisions under which other owners of small tracts may acquire rights to be supplied with project water by assuming the payment of a just charge.\n The entire project is within the state of Wyoming, where irrigation is practiced and the doctrine of appropriation prevails. Pursuant to a direction in section 8 of the act (Comp. St.  4707) and in conformity with the laws of the state, permits were sought and obtained from the state officers enabling the plaintiff to proceed with the impounding of the waters of the river-which concededly were open \n\n[263 U.S. 497, 500]\n\u00a0\n to appropriation-and with their distribution, delivery and use in consummating the purposes of the project.\n One branch of the project, known as the Garland Division, was designed to accomplish the reclamation and cultivation of a large body of lands, in the center of which was a school section of 640 acres owned by the state. The present controversy arose in that division. The ravine, called Bitter creek, and the lands of the defendants are all there. In 1908 the work had progressed to a point where the plaintiff began delivering project water to lands in that division. In 1910 the plaintiff sold a small tract adjoining the school section to one of the defendants, and in 1913 sold a like tract similarly situated to another of the defendants. Both tracts are crossed by the ravine. These sales were made under the act, and each carried a project water right. In 1910 and 1911 the state sold most of the school section in small tracts to some of the defendants. Three or four of these tracts are crossed by the ravine. No water right passed with the sales; nor was any project water right sought or obtained by the purchasers. But they attempted to appropriate, and claim they did appropriate, water found in the ravine for the irrigation of their tracts.\n It is made very plain on the record that when the defendants acquired the small tracts-two from the plaintiff and the others from the state-the work in that division was well advanced and still in progress, that water was then being delivered through project canals and laterals, that irrigation under them had begun and was being extended, and that the general situation was such as to put the defendants on inquiry respecting the rights which the plaintiff possessed and might exercise in completing and perfecting the work.\n With this understanding of matters about which there can be no controversy, we come to the questions brought \n\n[263 U.S. 497, 501]\n\u00a0\n to the attention of the courts below and pressed for decision here. Shortly stated they are: (1) Whether the plaintiff has a reserved right of way over the small tracts, under which it may convert the ravine into a ditch to be used for the purposes already indicated; (2) whether, apart from seepage from project irrigation, the ravine carries a natural stream or flow of water susceptible of effective appropriation; (3) whether the plaintiff had a right to recapture and utilize seepage from project irrigation finding its way into the ravine; and (4) if it had, whether that right has been abandoned.\n\n 1. \nThe patents for the tracts acquired from the plaintiff expressly reserve to it rights of way 'for canals and ditches constructed or to be constructed by its authority,' and that reservation is based on a direction in the Act of August 30, 1890, c. 837, 26 Stat. 391 (Comp. St.  4933), that there be expressed in all patents issued under the public land laws for lands west of the one hundredth meridian a reservation of rights of way 'for ditches or canals constructed by the authority of the United States.' Because the patents say 'constructed or to be constructed,' when the statute only says 'constructed,' it is contended that the reservation is broader than the direction, and is to that extent void. But we think the contention ascribes to the direction a narrower scope than Congress intended it should have. The officers of the land department, as the patents show, regard it as comprehending all canals and ditches constructed under the direct authority of the United States, whether the construction precedes or follows the issue of the patent. That the words of the direction admit of this interpretation is plain, and that it accords with the legislative purpose is demonstrable. When the direction was given the United States had no canals or ditches on the public lands west of the one hundredth meridian, either constructed or in process of construction. As yet it had not become engaged in the reclamation of its arid public lands \n\n[263 U.S. 497, 502]\n\u00a0\n in that region. But it was actively conducting investigations and collecting data with a view to developing and formulating a feasible plan for taking up and prosecuting that work. At an early stage of the investigations Congress became solicitous lest continued disposal of lands in that region under the land laws might render it difficult and soctly to obtain necessary rights of way for canals and ditches when the work was undertaken. To avoid such embarrassment Congress at first withdrew great bodies of the lands from disposal under the land laws. Act Oct. 2, 1888, c. 1069, 25 Stat. 526 (Comp. St.  4696); 19 Op. Attys. Gen. 564; 9 Land Dec. 282; 11 Land Dec. 296. That action proved unsatisfactory, and, by the Act of August 30, 1890, Congress repealed the withdrawal, restored the lands to disposal under the land laws, and gave the direction that in all patents there should be a reservation of rights of way, etc. Of course the direction must be interpreted in the light of the circumstances which prompted it, and when this is done the conclusion is unavoidable that the direction is intended to include canals and ditches constructed after patent issues quite as much as those constructed before. All courts in which the question has arisen have taken this view. Green v. Willhite (C. C.) 160 Fed. 755; United States v. Van Horn (D. C.) 197 Fed. 611; Green v. Willhite, 14 Idaho, 238, 93 Pac. 971.\n Wyoming has a statute granting rights of way over all lands of the state for ditches 'constructed by and under the authority of the United States' and providing that all conveyances by the state shall contain 'a reservation for rights of way' of that class. Laws 1905, c. 85. The patents issued by the state for the tracts in the school section all contain a clause showing that the title was transferred subject to all rights of way granted under the laws of the state 'or reserved to the United States.' A contention is made that the statute and the reservation in the patents are confined to ditches constructed while the state owned the land. But it is not claimed that the \n\n[263 U.S. 497, 503]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court of the state has so decided, and as we read the statute and reservation they refute the contention.\n We conclude that the plaintiff has a lawfully reserved right of way over the tracts of the defendants for such ditches as may be needed to effect the irrigation of the lands which the project is intended to reclaim, and that the defendants were apprised of this right by the patents which passed the tracts to them. In short, they received and hold the title subject to the exercise of that right.\n Assuming that there is in the ravine crossing these tracts no natural stream or flow of water susceptible of effective appropriation, the plaintiff undoubtedly has the right to make any needed changes in the ravine and to use it as a ditch in irrigating project lands. The defendants do not question this, but they say that the ditch is to be used for drainage purposes, and that this is not within the reserved right. We need not consider the second branch of the objection, for the first is faulty. The evidence shows that the ditch is intended to collect project waters once used in irrigation, and found seeping or percolating where they are not needed, and to conduct them where they can be used in further irrigation. This plainly is an admissible purpose. The defendants also say that there is no need for making any change in the ravine, because its fall, depth, and other features render it adequate for the purpose. There is some testimony to this effect, but the weight of the evidence is quite the other way.\n\n 2. \nOn the question whether there is in the ravine a natural stream or flow of water which could be the subject of an effective appropriation, the courts below differed, the District Court resolving it in the affirmative and the Circuit Court of Appeals in the negative. The evidence bearing on the question is conflicting, but the conflict is not difficult of solution, if regard be had for the varying opportunities of the several witnesses for observing and describing the natural conditions. \n\n[263 U.S. 497, 504]\n\u00a0\n There was no irrigation in the vicinity of the ravine prior to 1908. Project irrigation there began that year and was gradually extended. Seepage from it promptly found its way into the ravine and kept pace with the irrigation. In 1910 there had come to be enough seepage to produce a small but appreciable flow during the irrigation season. That was an artificial flow, coming from a source created and controlled by the plaintiff. The defendants came on the scene after that flow began. One of them was the chief witness on their side, and the District Court, as shown by its opinion found in the record, attached much weight to his testimony. The witness never saw the ravine or the adjacent country until 1910, and his testimony reflected the changed rather than the natural conditions. The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly pointed this out, and gave greater weight to the testimony of witnesses whose observation and knowledge went back to a time when the natural conditions had not been disturbed.\n We have examined the evidence and shall summarize what we regard it as proving.\n The ravine is a wash or gully made by surface drainage through a long course of years. It has a length of several miles and receives the drainage from a large area devoid of trees and brush and without lakes or springs. The annual precipitation, including snow, is less than 6 inches, and the evaporation is pronounced. The water naturally draining into the ravine comes from melting snow and exceptional rains. That from melting snow causes an intermittent flow for about 60 days beginning late in February, and that from exceptional rains sometimes causes a flow for half a day or a day. At all other times the ravine is naturally dry. The flow from melting snow ceases before the irrigation season begins, and topographical conditions are such that it is not practicable to collect and store the water. The defendants \n\n[263 U.S. 497, 505]\n\u00a0\n have not attempted to do so. The flow from rain is of such short duration and so uncertain that no practical use can be made of it.\n As before stated, soon after the project irrigation began, seepage therefrom caused an artificial flow. At first this flow was slight and confined to the irrigation season, but it gradually increased in volume and duration as the irrigated area was extended.\n From this summary it is apparent that for short and irregular periods, mostly outside the irrigation season, the ravine has a natural flow, but that this water is not susceptible of useful appropriation. In Wyoming an appropriation which is not useful is of no effect, for under the law of that state beneficial use is the basis, measure and limit of all appropriation. Comp. Stat. 1910,  724. It follows that the asserted appropriations from the ravine are of no effect, unless they confer or carry some right in the artificial flow. Evidently this is what they really were intended to do.\n\n 3. \nThe seepage producing the artificial flow is part of the water which the plaintiff, in virtue of its appropriation, takes from the Shoshone river and conducts to the project lands in the vicinity of the ravine for use in their irrigation. The defendants insist that when water is once used under the appropriation it cannot be used again-that the right to use it is exhausted. But we perceive no ground for thinking the appropriation is thus restricted. According to the record it is intended to cover, and does cover, the reclamation and cultivation of all the lands within the project. A second use in accomplishing that object is as much within the scope of the appropriation as a first use is. The state law and the National Reclamation Act both contemplate that the water shall be so conserved that it may be subjected to the largest practicable use. A further contention is that the plaintiff sells the water before it is used, and \n\n[263 U.S. 497, 506]\n\u00a0\n therefore has no right in the seepage. But the water is not sold. In disposing of the lands in small parcels, the plaintiff invests each purchaser with a right to have enough water supplied from the project canals to irrigate his land, but it does not give up all control over the water or do more than pass to the purchaser a right to use the water so far as may be necessary in properly cultivating his land. Beyond this all rights incident to the appropriation are retained by the plaintiff. Its right in the seepage is well illustrated by the following excerpt from the opinion of District Judge Dietrich in United States v. Haga, 276 Fed. 41, 43:\n'One who by the expenditure of money and labor diverts appropriable water from a stream, and thus makes it available for fruitful purposes, is entitled to its exclusive control so long as he is able and willing to apply it to beneficial uses, and such right extends to what is commonly known as wastage from surface runoff and deep percolation, necessarily incident to practical irrigation. Considerations of both public policy and natural justice strongly support such a rule. Nor is it essential to his control that the appropriator maintain continuous actual possession of such water. So long as he does not abandon it or forfeit it by failure to use, he may assert his rights. It is not necessary that he confine it upon his own land or convey it in an artificial conduit. It is requisite, of course, that he be able to identify it; but, subject to that limitation, he may conduct it through natural channels and may even commingle it or suffer it to commingle with other waters. In short, the rights of an appropriator in these respects are not affected by the fact that the water has once been used.'\n\n An instructive application of this rule is found in McKelvey v. North Sterling Irrigation District, 66 Colo. 11, 179 Pac. 872.\n\n 4. \nMeasures for collecting and using the seepage could not well be taken in advance of its appearance. When \n\n[263 U.S. 497, 507]\n\u00a0\n it began to appear in appreciable quantity the plaintiff's officers took up the formulation of plans for utilizing it. The matter was much considered, for like problems were arising in connection with other projects. The advice of army engineers was sought; plans were recommended and adopted; necessary expenditures were authorized, and the work was then undertaken. That on the ravine was begun in 1914. At no time was there any purpose to abandon the seepage. On the contrary, the plaintiff needed and intended to use all of it for project purposes. This was stated and restated in various official reports, including some by the Director of the Reclamation Service and the Secretary of the Interior, and was well understood by the project officers. In these circumstances it is very plain that the plaintiff's right in the seepage was not abandoned.\n As making against this conclusion, the defendants say that the plaintiff in 1910 applied to the state engineer for a permit authorizing it to divert water from the ravine for the irrigation of particular lands and that the application was returned without approval. But we find no evidence of abandonment in this. If the application shows anything material in this connection, it is that the plaintiff was then intending to divert and use the seepage. The reason given by the state engineer for returning the application without approval was that the irrigation of the particular lands was 'already covered' by the plaintiff's existing permit. Certainly nothing was lost by the application or by the engineer's action thereon.\n\n 5. \nThe appropriations from the ravine which are asserted by some of the defendants were made under permits issued by the state engineer in 1910 and 1915, and this is advanced as a reason for sustaining them. The permits were based on ex parte applications and were mere licenses to appropriate in accordance with the law of the state, if the water was available. Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 488\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 552. We have seen that under the law of the \n\n[263 U.S. 497, 508]\n\u00a0\n state the natural flow could not be appropriated, because the conditions did not admit of its beneficial use, and that the artificial flow was not available, because the plaintiff was entitled and intending to use it. The asserted appropriations therefore derive no support from the permits.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nILLINOIS CENT R. CO. v. U S(1924)\nNo. 248\nArgued: April 28, 1924Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Beryamen Carter, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.[ Illinois Cent R Co v. U S \n265 U.S. 209\n (1924) ]\n\n\n[265 U.S. 209, 212]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C ., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in the case is whether in certain shipments of property for use by the United States, title to the property passed at the place of shipment or at the place of delivery; or to state the question another way, whether the shipments while in transit were the property of the United States and properly transported at land grant rates, or did not become the property of the United States until after receipt at destination and subject to commercial rates. The latter is the contention of the railroad company although it rendered bills for and accepted payment of them upon the other view. Its explanation is: It believed that that view was correct; that is, believed the shipments were the property of the United States, and, so believing, rendered bills for $40,000 less than it was entitled to, and, so believing, accepted payment of them. For that $40,000 this action was brought. The Court of Claims decided against the railroad company and dismissed its petition.\n There is no contest of the findings or of the decision of the Court of Claims, other than that expressed in the contention above stated.\n It appears from the findings that the railroad company is a corporation and in the operation of a system of railways, those on which the shipments with which this case is concerned were transported. Three of the railways of the system were constructed with the aid of public lands granted by Congress.\n The shipments consisted of certain articles for use in government improvements of the Missouri river. \n\n[265 U.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n The contention seems to be that the shipments were to be tested or inspected at or beyond destinations and accepted or rejected there, but while in course of transportation were not to belong to the United States. To sustain this view, Clarkson v. Stevens, \n106 U.S. 505\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 200, is cited. The case does not sustain the contention. It was decided that the intention of the parties was determinative, not an arbitrary rule of construction. In the case at bar the findings of the court demonstrate that the government especially intended to avail itself of the effect that the shipments were to be transported over land grant roads. and that it, the government, was entitled to deductions from the commercial rates.\n The years of the shipments and the roads over which they were to be transported are given in finding V and the finding recites:\n'These materials and supplies were all purchased on invitation to bidders, proposals of bidders, and vouchers, on which payments were made to the sellers. The form of invitation on which bids were made invariably read: 'The prices will be for the articles delivered f. o. b. cars at [the place of shipment]. The successful bidder will procure the cars, but the United States will pay the freight and furnish shipping instructions and bills of lading. This arrangement is made to enable the government to take advantage of land grant rates and will not operate to relieve the dealer of any responsibility as shipper that would attach if the delivery had been at destination.' This form of invitation was only used over land grant or bond-aided roads, and was never used where delivery was to be made at point of use.'\n\n And the finding states that:\n'The shipments were all made on government bills of lading, which were accomplished, the articles inspected and accepted at points of use by the proper government officials.'\n\n We agree with the Court of Claims:\n That 'the United States and the contractors were privileged to write into their contracts such terms as they saw fit,' and that 'provisions \n\n[265 U.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n for a final inspection at point of delivery or for the rendering of a further service by the contractor at that point were not inconsistent with and could not be invoked to nullify a specific provision under which the title ... passed to the United States by delivery at the initial point of shipment to the carrier as agent. Land grant rates were applicable.'\n See Hatch v. Oil Company, \n100 \nU.S. 124, 134\n, 135 S..\n As we have seen, the railroad company made land grant deductions from commercial rates in the bills it rendered. It does not now show fraud or mistake of fact; its only excuse is that its 'officers believed that the shipments belonged to the United States.' It is not charged that the belief was engendered by any practices or artifices of the officers of the United States, and it seems to have had continuity for a long time. A finding of the Court of Claims is that:\n'Part of the claim presented, amounting to $2,511.68, relating to shipments from October 30, 1911, to March 7, 1912, was barred by the statute of limitations when this suit was commenced, March 23, 1918.'\n\n The government dealt with the consignors as if the property was its- dealt with the railroad company as if the property was its (the government's)-and, as we have seen, the railroad company dealt with the government on that assumption, and the contractors dealt with it on that assumption. The incidental regulations between it and the contractors cannot divest that ownership in the interest of the railroad company.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE EAST RIVER TOWING CO(1924)\nNo. 81\nArgued: November 25, 1924Decided: December 8, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 355, 356]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

The facts \n\n[266 U.S. 355, 365]\n\u00a0\n are few. On August 22, 1922, the Steamtug Edward, belonging to East River Towing Company, Inc., a New York Corporation, sank in New York harbor because of an explosion of her boiler. This caused the death of her captain, Thomas McCaffrey, and his administratrix brought a suit against the Company in the Supreme Court of New York. Thereupon the Company filed a petition for limitation of liability in the District Court of the United States. Rev. Stat.,  4283, et seq. (Comp. St.  8021 et seq.); Admiralty Rules, 51-55. The District Court made an order under Rule 51 restraining the further prosecution of the suit, but on motion vacated the stay on the ground that the statutes limitating liability were repealed so far as they applied to this case by the Merchant Marine Act, June 5, 1920, c. 250,  33, 41 Stat. 988, 1007 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8337a), under which the suit purports to be brought. 294 F. 686. The questions certified are:\n'(1) If an action at law be brought such as is described in Merchant Marine Act 1920, Sec. 33, can the prosecution thereof be enjoined by the injunction provided for in Admiralty Rule 51? (2) Has the Merchant Marine Act 1920, Sec. 33, impliedly repealed the statute regarding limitation of liability of ship owners so far as claims or suits based on personal injuries to or death of seamen are concerned?'\n\n Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act gives an action at law with the right of trial by jury to any seaman suffering personal injury in the course of his employment, or to his personal representative in case of his death from such injury. In the former cases the statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common law right or remedy of railway employees shall apply; in the latter such statutes conferring or regulating the right of action for death of such employees. The argument that this section removes the personal injury or death of seamen from the statutes limiting liability is based upon the growing considerations for the claims of labor; the \n\n[266 U.S. 355, 366]\n\u00a0\n suggestion that the enlistment of seamen needs to be encouraged equally with the building of ships; and the supposed inconsistency of the right to a jury trial and of some of the statutes incorporated by reference, with the continued application of the older law. Thus the Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657-8665), as amended by the Act of April 5, 1910, c. 143, 36 Stat. 291 (sections 8662, 8665), regulating actions for injuries or death of railroad employees gives concurrent jurisdiction to the courts of the States and of the United States and forbids the removal of cases arising under the act from state courts of competent jurisdiction to any court of the United States. It is argued that a stay of proceedings in the State Court and an adjudication in the District Court would be a removal; which of course it would not be in a technical sense. It is said with more force in The El Mundo (D. C.) 294 F. 577, 579, that when  33 was passed a seaman at his election already had his action with trial by jury, or a libel in the admiralty, but in either case subject to injunction and a concourse under Rev. Stat.  4285 (Comp. St.  8023), and that if the new section left the seaman's election liable to be defeated by the election of the owner to surrender his ship, it was empty words. So the 'election' to 'maintain' an action at law given by section 33 is thought not reconcilable with the possibility that he should be called into admiralty against his will, and his action at law stopped. In re Charles Nelson Co. (D. C.) 294 F. 926, 929, reversed, however, October 27, 1924 (C. C. A.) 1 F.(2d) 774.\n We are of opinion that these arguments cannot prevail. We shall not follow the discussions in the briefs as to the origin of the Admiralty rule, a question that cannot be answered with confidence from the historical material now at hand. The English Courts interpreting, we presume, the scope of their own decisions, rather than passing upon historical fact, refer the Admiralty liens to the commercial convenience of security and repundiate the \n\n[266 U.S. 355, 367]\n\u00a0\n reference of liability to the guilt of the ship. The Tervaete, \n\n[266 U.S. 355, 1922]\n\u00a0\n P. 259, 270. In this Court the ship has been personified so far as to incur liability in cases where the owner could not be held. The China, 7 Wall. 53. See The Malek Adhel, 2 How. 210, 234; Liverpool, Brazil & River Plate Steam Navigation Co. v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, \n251 \nU.S. 48, 53\n, 40 S. Ct. 66. It is laid down in The China that:\n'Originally, the primary liability was upon the vessel, and that of the owner was not personal, but merely incidental to his ownership, from which he was discharged either by the loss of the vessel or by abandoning it to the creditors.'\n\n If this be true it gives to our statute a distinguished family tree but hardly throws light upon the question now before the Court.\n The short point is that the later act determines the extent of the seaman's substantive rights and the measure of damages, Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 391\n, 44 S. Ct. 391; the earlier one, from what he shall collect those damages in certain exceptional cases, where those rights have been infringed. If there is no surrender of the ship, which we presume is made relatively rarely, the limited liability statutes play no part. Section 33 has no relation to means of collection but only to principles of liability and the ordinary course of trial. Naturally therefore the limited liability laws are not mentioned in the list of statutes repealed, in section 2 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8146 1\/4 a), yet there can be no doubt that those laws would apply unless repealed. No sufficient reason is offered for the extraordinary preference over other claims that would be given to seamen were the decree of the District Court sustained. When a preference in respect of seamen's wages was intended it was expressed. Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121,  18, 23 Stat. 57 (Comp. St.  8028). On the other hand it has been laid down with reference to this same section 33 that an intention to depart from apolicy deliberately settled in a general statute is not lightly to be assumed. Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, \n\n[266 U.S. 355, 368]\n\u00a0\n \n264 \nU.S. 375, 384\n, 44 S. Ct. 391. See also Butler v. Boston & Savannah Steamship Co., \n130 \nU.S. 527\n, 9 S. Ct. 612. The bankruptcy act might provide a bar to recovery-homestead and other exemptions might make collection of a judgment impossible-yet we do not suppose that it would be argued that such laws were overridden by section 33. The wholesale adoption of the law for railroads above mentioned must be taken as an adoption of principles not as a basis for meticulous discovery of conflict with an established system in matters of detail. The choice of a jury trial is given when things take their ordinary course, not to break in upon the settled mode of adjustment when the ship is given up.\n We answer these questions as they are asked and assume that the State Court had jurisdiction to try the case under the concluding words of the section: 'Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.' For assuming that it had jurisdiction we have no doubt that the injunction may issue and that the statute regarding limitation of liability of ship owners has not been repealed so far as claims like the present are concerned. We answer\n Question (1): Yes.\n Question (2): No. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE SKINNER & EDDY CORPORATION(1924)\nNo. 28\nArgued: Decided: May 12, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 86, 87]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis Titus, of Washington, D. C., George Donworth, of Seattle, Wash., and J. Barrett Carter, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 86, 88]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 86, 91]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition for a writ of mandamus directed to the Court of Claims to restore its order of April 30, 1923, dismissing the suit of the Skinner & Eddy Corporation against the United States, and to set aside its order of November 28, 1923, vacating the order of dismissal and to prohibit the court from attempting to exercise further jurisdiction in the case. The judges of the Court of Claims have made a response to a rule to show cause.\n On June 15, 1921, the petitioner brought this suit against the United States in the Court of Claims for $17,493,488.97. The cause of action was based on balances alleged to be due for the construction of certain ships, for bonuses for advanced deliveries of others, and for extra labor, extra work and repairs on other vessels, all for the United States. The principal part of the claim grew out of the cancellation of two contracts between the petitioner and the United States Emergency Fleet Corporation 'representing the United States.' The largest item of the claim was for anticipated profits on 25 vessels. On August 15, 1921, no plea, answer or notice of any counterclaim having been filed by the government, a general traverse was entered by the clerk of the court under its rule No. 34. No further pleadings were filed and no proceedings were had of any kind until April 11, 1923, when petitioner filed its motion to dismiss the suit without prejudice. The petitioner based the motion on the ground that it had begun its suit under the Act of June 15, 1917 (chapter 29, 40 Stat. 182, 183), as amended by section 2, par. (c), of the Merchant Marine Act of June 5, 1920 (chapter 250, 41 Stat. 989 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8146 1\/4 a]); that, as interpreted by this court, these acts required the claims to be first presented to the President \n\n[265 U.S. 86, 92]\n\u00a0\n for him to determine the just compensation, prior to the filing of a suit; and that, as this claim was not presented to the President, the Court of Claims had no jurisdiction. On April 12th the government moved to withdraw its general traverse and for leave to file its answer and cross-bill. The motions were argued, and on April 30, 1923, the court made an order granting the petitioner's motion and dismissed its petition.\n On May 1, 1923, one day after the dismissal, the petitioner filed a suit against the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation in the state court of Washington at Seattle, on substantially the same causes of action as those sued for in the Court of Claims, but omitting certain phases of damages claimed, for $9,129,401.14.\n On June 9, 1923, at the same term of the court the government moved for a reargument of petitioner's motion to dismiss without prejudice, and to allow the government to file a counterclaim. The motion was inadvertently overruled October 22, 1923, but, upon restoration and reargument, the order of dismissal was vacated and leave was given to the government to file its counterclaim.\n It is intimated on behalf of the government that the reason given by the petitioner for his motion to dismiss in April, 1923, was not a genuine one. The petitioner offers that and others. Others are that under the decision of this court in Sloan Shipyard Corporation v. United States Shipping Board Fleet Corporation, \n258 U.S. 549\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 386, and United States Shipping Board v. Sullivan, \n261 U.S. 146\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 292, it was doubtful whether under the contracts sued on a recovery could be had against the government in the Court of Claims; and, second, that it was doubtful whether under Russell Motor Co. v. United States, \n261 U.S. 514\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 428, there could be any recovery for anticipated profits under the canceled contracts, which was the basis for nearly half of the claim.\n We think this mandamus must be granted. At common law a plaintiff has an absolute right to discontinue or dismiss \n\n[265 U.S. 86, 93]\n\u00a0\n his suit at any stage of the proceedings prior to verdict or judgment, and this right has been declared to be substantial. Barrett v. Virginian Railway Co., \n250 U.S. 473\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 540; Confiscation Cases, 7 Wall. 454, 457; Veazie v. Wadleigh, 11 Pet. 55; United States v. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co., 118 Fed. 554, 55 C. C. A. 320.\n It is ordinarily the undisputed right of a plaintiff to dismiss a bill in equity before final hearing. McGowan et al. v. Columbia, etc., Association, \n245 \nU.S. 352, 358\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 129. In Pullman's Car Co. v. Transportation Co., \n171 \nU.S. 138, 146\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 808, this statement of the rule in City of Detroit v. Detroit City Railway Co. (C. C.) 55 Fed. 569, was approved:\n'It is very clear from an examination of the authorities, English and American, that the right of a complainant to dismiss his bill without prejudice, on payment of costs, was of course except in certain cases. Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Union Rolling-Mill Co., \n109 U.S. 702\n, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594. The exception was where a dismissal of the bill would prejudice the defendants in some other way than by the mere prospect of being harassed and vexed by future litigation of the same kind.'\n\n See Cowham v. McNider (D. C.) 261 Fed. 714; Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v. Holland (C. C.) 160 Fed. 768; Morton Trust Co. v. Keith (C. C.) 150 Fed. 606; Pennsylvania Globe Gaslight Co. v. Globe Gaslight Co. (C. C.) 121 Fed. 1015; Youtsey v. Hoffman (C. C.) 108 Fed. 699; McCabe v. Southern Railway Co. (C. C.) 107 Fed. 213.\n The right to dismiss, if it exists, is absolute. It does not depend on the reasons which the plaintiff offers for his action. The fact that he may not have disclosed all his reasons, or may not have given the real one, cannot affect his right.\n The usual ground for denying a complainant in equity the right to dismiss his bill without prejudice at his own costs is that the cause has proceeded so far that the defendant is in a position to demand on the pleadings an \n\n[265 U.S. 86, 94]\n\u00a0\n opportunity to seek affirmative relief and he would be prejudiced by being remitted to a separate action. Having been put to the trouble of getting his counter case properly pleaded and ready, he may insist that the cause proceed to a decree.\n We do not perceive in the circumstances of this case any such ground for making an exception to the general rule, as was shown in Western Union Tel. Co. v. American Bell Tel. Co. (C. C.) 50 Fed. 662, 664, or in City of Detroit v. Detroit City Railway Co. (C. C.) 55 Fed. 569, or Manufacturing Co. v. Waring (C. C.) 46 Fed. 87, or Electrical Co. v. Brush Co. (C. C.) 44 Fed. 602, or in Bank v. Rose, 1 Rich. Eq. (S. C.) 294, or Booth v. Leycester, 1 Keen, 247.\n Under section 145 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1136), the Court of Claims is given jurisdiction to hear and determine all counterclaims on the part of the government 'against any claimant against the government in said court.' Under rule 34 of that court, notice of such counterclaim must be filed within 60 days after the service of the petition on the Attorney General. In this case, no such counterclaim was filed and a general traverse was noted by the clerk. Eighteen months elapsed and nothing was done when the petitioner moved to dismiss without prejudice, and then the government without proffering any actual counterclaim asked for leave to file one, objecting to dismissal. The cause was dismissed out 6 months later it was restored and a counterclaim filed.\n The government had not, when the case was dismissed, given any time or expense to the preparation and filing of a cross-bill or of the evidence to sustain it. It had not taken any action in respect to the cause which entitled it so say that it would be prejudiced by a dismissal within the meaning of the authorities. It suddenly was awakened by the motion to dismiss to the fact that by 18 months' delay it was losing a possible opportunity to litigate a cross-claim in the Court of Claims and without a \n\n[265 U.S. 86, 95]\n\u00a0\n jury. We think the same rule should obtain in the procedure of the Court of Claims an in federal courts of law and equity in respect to the dismissal of cases without prejudice.\n But there is a special reason why the rule must be enforced in this case. By section 154 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1145), it is provided that:\n'No person shall file or prosecute in the Court of Claims, or in the Supreme Court on appeal therefrom, any claim for or in respect to which he or any assignee of his has pending in any other court any suit or process against any person who, at the time when the cause of action alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect thereto, acting or professing to act, mediately or immediately, under the authority of the United States.'\n\n The day after the dismissal of this suit in the Court of Claims, April 30, 1923, the petitioner filed suit in a state court of Washington for something more than $9,000,000 for the same causes of action as those sued for in the Court of Claims, except the claims for anticipated profits. That suit and the section of the Code just quoted necessarily prevent the petitioner from suing on those claims in the Court of Claims, and exclude its jurisdiction of them, because the Fleet Corporation which is sued in the Washington court was certainly acting or professing to act, mediately or immediately, under the authority of the United States. The jurisdiction of these claims by the Court of Claims having been parted with by the order of dismissal in April cannot be resumed by a retroactive order of the subsequent November, in view of the restrictive provisions of section 154, which, by reason of the Washington suit, intervene and apply. Corona Coal Co. v. United States, \n263 U.S. 537\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 156, 68 L. Ed. --, decided January 7, 1924\n\n\n It only remains to inquire whether this is a proper case for the writ asked. Mandamus is an extraordinary remedial process, which is awarded, not as a matter of \n\n[265 U.S. 86, 96]\n\u00a0\n right, but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion. Although classed as a legal remedy, in issuing it a court must be largely controlled by equitable principles. Duncan Townsite Co. v. Lane, \n245 \nU.S. 308, 312\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 99; Arant v. Lane, \n249 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 293. It would be a useless waste of time and effort to enforce a trial in the Court of Claims, if we were, upon appeal, to find that the petitioner was unjustly deprived of his substantial right to dismiss his petition, as we should have to do for the reasons stated. Added to this is the consideration which has been regarded as furnishing a substantial ground for the extraordinary process of the writ that the petitioner by a denial of his right to dismiss in the Court of Claims will be deprived of a right of trial by jury in the State Court of Washington.

Curtis Rouse, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 105, 107]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By this original petition the duly accredited Minister of the Republic of Portugal asks for the writ of prohibition or mandamus to prevent further action in the proceeding instituted by Stephen Ransom Dry Dock & Repair Corporation in the District Court at New York, April 14, 1921, to enforce payment for services and materials furnished the Sao Vicente. Recognizing the high consideration always due diplomatic representatives of friendly nations, we entertained the petition and directed a rule to show cause why relief should not be granted. The return is here, and, after hearing oral argument, we think the court below acted within its jurisdiction, and with due regard to the rights of all concerned.\n The original libel in rem, filed April 14, 1921, claimed for supplies and labor furnished the Sao Vicente and prayed for condemnation and sale of the vessel. April 15th Transportes Maritimos do Estado intervened as the true owner, having possession when process issued; the customary stipulation for value, bond, and release of the ship followed.\n Answering by proctor, May 31, 1921, the vessel denied liability and objected to the jurisdiction, because it was 'owned and operated by Transportes Maritimos do Estado, a department of the sovereign foreign government of Portugal as aforesaid, and that it cannot be sued in any of the courts of the United States without its consent, and that this action is in substance and effect an action against the government of Portugal, and as such is not maintainable against this respondent.' An interlocutory decree of June 9, 1923, directed the master to ascertain the amount due.\n July 5, 1923, the present petitioner filed a formal suggestion. He stated that the general appearance by \n\n[264 U.S. 105, 108]\n\u00a0\n counsel retained by the vice consul general of the Republic of Portugal was unauthorized by his government. and that the vessel was owned and operated by Transportes Maritimos do Estado, a department of the sovereign government of Portugal. He protested against exercise of jurisdiction by the court, and asked that the proceedings be dismissed. The Secretary of State gave no sanction or approval to this course, but certified the diplomatic position of the Minister. Upon motion the suggestion was stricken from the files. Final judgment for the libelant followed and, upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this, with interest and damages, October 1, 1923. (No opinion). No proper steps were taken to secure an orderly review by this court.\n Plainly the trial court obtained jurisdiction over the res, and, in the absence of any claim of immunity, it would have been required to render judgment. It had power to consider and pass upon both form and substance of any objection to its jurisdiction because of ownership, and to decide whether it should proceed under the circumstances. There was a plain way to seek review here, if the defeated party had so desired.\n We find no adequate ground for granting the extraordinary relief now asked.

Geo. M. Napier, T. R. Gress, and Frank Carter, all of Atlanta, Ga., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Georgia (Acts 1921, p. 46,  2, par. 30) imposes a flat tax of $100 upon any broker or commission merchant buying or selling merchandise on commission for another, or engaged in the business of receiving or distributing articles of merchandise shipped to such broker or merchant for distribution on account of the shipper. The bill filed below sought to enjoin the collection of the tax on the ground that the statute violates the commerce clause of the federal Constitution, and also, contingently, upon the further ground that the statute is void under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The complainants were divided into two classes, A and B. The business of those in class B was to solicit orders for goods from dealers in Georgia, which orders were sent to be filled, sometimes to nonresident and sometimes to resident principals; the greater part of the business being with nonresident principals. The business of those in \n\n[264 U.S. 157, 159]\n\u00a0\n class A was wholly confined to representation of nonresident principals. Upon acceptance of an order the goods are shipped by the principal to the purchaser, but remain the property of the former until the time of sale.\n The trial court sustained the tax as to class B and enjoined its collection as to class A, and its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 154 Ga. 140, 113 S. E. 531. We are concerned here with the judgment only in so far as it affects class B.\n The contention is that the tax is laid, expressly, upon all brokers and commission merchants in the state, and upon the business done by them, whether interstate or intrastate, without separating one from the other. The state courts, by whose construction we are bound, held that the statute did not apply to interstate business, and we consider it as though it so provided in terms. It was held, however, that inasmuch as class B complainants were engaged in intrastate business they were subject to the tax, and none the less because they were also engaged in interstate business. With this conclusion we fully agree.\n The complainants were definitely engaged in the domestic business described in the statute and were liable to the tax, irrespective of the extent of it, and whether they engaged in interstate business in addition or not. That the former was small in comparison with the latter makes no difference; nor does the fact that both were carried on at the same time and in the same establishment. If the two were not distinct, but the former a mere incident of the latter, the burden was upon complainants to furnish the proof, in which case a different question would arise. Kehrer v. Stewart, \n197 \nU.S. 60, 69\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 403. Certainly one cannot avoid a tax upon a taxable business by also engaging in a nontaxable business.\n There is nothing in the contention that because, under the construction placed upon the statute by the state \n\n[264 U.S. 157, 160]\n\u00a0\n courts, the tax falls upon those engaged in domestic business and does not fall upon those engaged in interstate business, it is void for inequality. It would be a strange application of the equality provision of the Fourteenth Amendment to say that, because a state is forbidden by paramount law to impose a tax upon some merchants, it is therefore powerless to impose it upon other merchants to whom the restriction does not apply. It is enough if the state observe the rule of equality among the persons subject to its taxing power.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAMES EVERARD'S BREWERIES v.

They involve the single question whether Section 2 of the Supplemental Prohibition Act of November 23, 1921, c. 134, 42 Stat. 222 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 ccc), is constitutional, in so far as it prevents physicians from prescribing intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes. This section of the Act provides:\n'That only spirituous and vinous liquor may be prescribed for medicinal purposes, and all permits to prescribe and prescriptions for any other liquor shall be void.'\n\n The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution provides:\n That 'the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States, ... for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited' (section 1), and that 'Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.' (section 2).\n The National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923 ,  10138 1\/4 et seq.]), enacted in pursuance of this Amendment, provides that no person shall 'manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, funish or possess any intoxicating liquor' except as authorized in the Act, and that all its provisions shall be liberally construed to the end that 'the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage' may be prevented, title 2,  3 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 aa); that intoxicating liquor 'for nonbeverage purposes' may be manufactured, sold, etc., 'but only' as provided in the Act, and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may issue permits therefor, Id.,  3; that no one shall manufacture, sell or prescribe intoxicating liquor without first obtaining a permit from the Commissioner, section 6 (section 10138 1\/2 c); that no permit shall be issued for the sale of intoxicating liquor at retail except through a pharmacist licensed to dispense medicine prescribed by physicians, \n\n[265 U.S. 545, 555]\n\u00a0\n section 6; that no one shall be given a permit to prescribe intoxicating liquor except a licensed practicing physician, section 6; that no one but a physician holding such permit shall issue any prescription for intoxicating liquor, section 7 (section 10138 1\/2 cc); and that not more than a pint of 'spirtuous liquor' shall be prescribed for the same person within any period of ten days, section 7.\n Under the Regulations adopted by the Treasury Department after the passage of the Act, physicians obtaining permits were authorized to prescribe only distilled spirits, wines, and certain alcoholic medicinal preparations. T. D. 2985. In October, 1921, pursuant to an opinion of the Attorney General that the Commissioner might issue permits for the manufacture of beer and other intoxicating malt liquors, as well as whisky and vinous liquors, for medicinal purposes (32 Op. Attys. Gen. 467), the Regulations were amended so as to authorize the Commissioner to issue permits for the manufacture of intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes, and to permit physicians to prescribe them. T. D. 3239\n\n\n In November Congress passed the Supplemental Act now in question, containing in section 2, as has been stated, the provision that 'only spirituous and vinous liquor may be prescribed for medicinal purposes,' and that all prescriptions for any other liquor1 and permits therefor shall be void. The direct effect of this provision is to prohibit physicians from prescribing intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes, and the Commissioner from issuing permits authorizing such prescriptions. This section also limits prescriptions for vinous liquor to one-fourth \n\n[265 U.S. 545, 556]\n\u00a0\n of a gallon, containing not more than 24 per centum of alcohol, and provides that the vinous and spirituous liquor prescribed for any person within any period of ten days shall not contain more than one-half pint of alcohol.\n James Everard's Breweries, the plaintiff in the first case, is a New York corporation. Prior to the passage of the Prohibition Act it had been engaged in the manufacture and sale of beer and other intoxicating malt liquors. After the Treasury Regulations had been amended, it obtained a permit for the manufacture of intoxicating malt liquor for medicinal purposes, and stout for sale to pharmacists for resale on physician's prescriptions. for resale on physician's prescriptions. When the Supplemental Act was passed it had on hand a large quantity of these intoxicating malt liquors which it could not thereafter sell in the conduct of its business, and of which it could only dispose, after de- alcoholization, at a heavy loss.\n Edward & John Burke, Limited, the plaintiff in the second case, is a British corporation, engaged in bottling and distributing an intoxicating malt liquor known as Guinness's Stout. Prior to the passage of the National Prohibition Act it had maintained a branch of its business in New York. Early in November, 1921, the Commissioner refused it a permit to sell such stout for medicinal purposes because of the pendency in Congress of the Supplemental Prohibition Bill. At the time of the passage of the Act it had on hand a large quantity of stout.\n Each of these corporations brought a suit in equity in the District Court to enjoin the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and other federal officers from enforcing the provision of the Supplemental Act prohibiting the prescribing of intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes, alleging that it was not authorized by the Eighteenth Amendment and was in conflict with other provisions \n\n[265 U.S. 545, 557]\n\u00a0\n of the Constitution. \n2\n Each of these bills was dismissed by the District Court, for want of equity. \n3\n The plaintiffs then appealed directly to this Court. Judicial Code,  238 (Comp. St.  1215).\n The contention that this provision of the Supplemental Act is unconstitutional, is based primarily upon the grounds: That the Eighteenth Amendment merely delegates to Congress the authority to prohibit the traffic in intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, and the control of the traffic in such liquors for non-beverage purposes is reserved to the several States; that while Congress possesses the incidental power to regulate the traffic in intoxicating liquors for non-beverage purposes so far as is reasonably necessary to make effective the prohibition of the traffic in such liquors for beverage purposes, this incidental power is limited to reasonable regulation and does not extend to complete prohibition; and that the prohibition of prescription for the use of intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes is neither an appropriate nor reasonable exercise of the power conferred upon Congress by the Amendment and infringes upon the \n\n[265 U.S. 545, 558]\n\u00a0\n legislative power of the States in matters affecting the public health.\n It is clear that if the Act is within the authority delegated to Congress by the Eighteenth Amendment, its validity is not impaired by reason of any power reserved to the States. The words 'concurrent power' as used in the second section of the Amendment 'do not mean joint power, or require that legislation thereunder by Congress, to be effective, shall be approved or sanctioned by the several States or any of them'; and the power confided to Congress, while not exclusive, 'is in no wise dependent on or affected by action or inaction on the part of the several States or any of them.' National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350, 387\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 486, 488 (64 L. Ed. 946). And if the Act is within the power confided to Congress, the Tenth Amendment, by its very terms, has no application, since it only reserves to the States 'powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution.' See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 406; Lottery Case, \n188 \nU.S. 321, 357\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 321.\n We come then to the question whether this Act is within the power conferred upon Congress by the Eighteenth Amendment. By its terms the Amendment prohibits the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, and grants to Congress the power to enforce this prohibition 'by appropriate legislation.' Its purposes is to suppress the entire traffic in intoxicating liquor as a beverage. See Grogan v. Hiram Walker & Sons, \n259 \nU.S. 80, 89\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 423, 22 A. L. R. 1116. And it must be respected and given effect in the same manner as other provisions of the Constitution. National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350, 386\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 486, 588.\n The Constitution confers upon Congress the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution all powers that are vested in it. Article 1,  8, cl. 18. In the exercise of such non- enumerated or 'implied' powers it has long been settled that Congress is \n\n[265 U.S. 545, 559]\n\u00a0\n not limited to such measures as are indispensably necessary to give effect to its express powers, but in the exercise of its discretion as to the means of carrying them into execution may adopt any means, appearing to it most eligible and appropriate, which are adapted to the end to be accomplished and consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution. United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 395; Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326; McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, pages 421, 422; Ex parte Curtis, \n106 \nU.S. 371, 372\n, 1 S. Sup. Ct. 381; Legal Tender Case, \n110 \nU.S. 421, 440\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 122; In re Rapier, \n143 \nU.S. 110, 134\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 374; Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263, 283\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 617; Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 712\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 1016; Lottery Case, supra, page 355 (23 Sup. Ct. 321); Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308, 323\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 281, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 906, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 905. Furthermore, aside from this fundamental rule, the Eighteenth Amendment specifically confers upon Congress the power to enforce 'by appropriate legislation' the constitutional prohibition of the traffic in intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes. This enables Congress to enforce the prohibition 'by appropriate means.' National Prohibition Cases, supra, page 387 (40 Sup. Ct. 486).\n It is likewise well settled that where the means adopted by Congress are not prohibited and are calculated to effect the object intrusted to it, this Court may not inquire into the degree of their necessity; as this would be to pass the line which circumscribes the judicial department and to tread upon legislative ground. McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, page 423; Legal Tender Case, supra, page 450 (4 Sup. Ct. 122); Fong Yue Ting v. United States, supra, page 713 (13 Sup. Ct. 1016). Nor may it enquire as to the wisdom of the legislation. Legal Tender Case, supra, page 450 (4 Sup. Ct. 122); McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 54\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries, \n251 \nU.S. 146, 161\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 106. What it may consider is whether that which has been done by Congress has gone beyond the constitutional limits upon its legislative discretion. Ex parte Curtis, supra, page 373 ( 1 Sup. Ct. 381). \n\n[265 U.S. 545, 560]\n\u00a0\n It is clear that Congress, under its express power to enforce by appropriate legislation the prohibition of traffic in intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, may adopt any eligible and appropriate means to make that prohibition effective. The possible abuse of a power is not an argument against its existence. Lottery Case, supra, page 363 (23 Sup. Ct. 321); Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries, supra, page 161 (40 Sup. Ct. 106). And it has been held that the power to prohibit traffic in intoxicating liquors includes, as an appropriate means of making that prohibition effective, power to prohibit traffic in similar liquors, although non- intoxicating. Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, \n226 U.S. 192\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 44; Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 U.S. 264\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 141.\n The ultimate and controlling question then is, whether in prohibiting physicians from prescribing intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes as a means of enforcing the prohibition of traffic in such liquors for beverage purposes, Congress has exceeded the constitutional limits upon its legislative discretion.\n In enacting this legislation Congress has affirmed its validity. The determination must be given great weight; this Court by an unbroken line of decisions having 'steadily adhered to the rule that every possible presumption is in favor of the validity of an act of Congress until overcome beyond rational doubt.' Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 544\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 394, 396 (67 L. Ed. 785, 24 A. L. R. 1238).\n We cannot say that prohibiting traffic in intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes has no real or substantial relation to the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, and is not adapted to accomplish that end and make the constitutional prohibition effective. The difficulties always attendant upon the suppression of traffic in intoxicating liquors are notorious. Crane v. Campbell, \n245 \nU.S. 304, 307\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 98. The Federal Government in enforcing prohibition is confronted with difficulties similar to those encountered by the States. Ruppert v. \n\n[265 U.S. 545, 561]\n\u00a0\n Caffey, supra, page 297 (40 Sup. Ct. 141). The opportunity to manufacture, sell and prescribe intoxicating malt liquors for 'medicinal purposes,' opens many doors to clandestine traffic in them as beverages under the guise of medicines; facilitates many frauds, subterfuges and artifices; aids evasion; and, thereby and to that extent, hampers and obstructs the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment. A provision in a revenue act which tends to diminish the opportunity for clandestine traffic in avoidance of the tax, has a reasonable relation to its enforcement. United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86, 94\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 214.\n Nor can it be held that the Act is an arbitrary any unreasonable prohibition of the use of valuable medicinal agents.\n When the bill was pending in Congress the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives held an extended public hearing, in which it received testimony, among other things, on the question whether beer and other intoxicating malt liquors possessed any substantial medicinal properties. Hearings before House Judiciary Committee on H. R. 5033, Serial 2, May 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 1921. On the information thus received the Committee recommended the passage of the bill. H. R., 67th Cong., 1st sess., Rep. No. 224.4 And in the light of all the \n\n[265 U.S. 545, 562]\n\u00a0\n testimony Congress determined, in effect, that intoxicating malt liquors possessed no substantial and essential medicinal properties which made it necessary that their use for medicinal purposes should be permitted, and that, as a matter affecting the public health, it was sufficient to permit physicians to prescribe spirituous and vinous intoxicating liquors in addition to the non-intoxicating malt liquors whose manufacture and sale is permitted under the National Prohibition Act.\n Neither beer nor any other intoxicating malt liquor is listed as a medicinal remedy in the United States Pharmacopeia. They are not generally recognized as medicinal agents. There is no consensus of opinion among physicians and medical authorities that they have any substantial value as medicinal agents; and while there is some difference of opinion on this subject the question is, at the most, debatable. And their medicinal properties, if any, may, it appears, be supplied by the use of other available remedies. That the opinion is extensively held that the prohibition of prescription of malt liquors is a necessary and proper means to the suppression of the traffic in intoxicating beverages likewise appears from the legislation in many States, under which such prescriptions are not permitted.\n The distinction made by Congress between permitting the prescription of spirituous and vinous liquors while prohibiting the prescription of malt liquors, is not plainly \n\n[265 U.S. 545, 563]\n\u00a0\n unreasonable or without a substantial justification, based upon their essential differences.\n We find, on the whole, no ground for disturbing the determination of Congress on the question of fact as to the reasonable necessity, in the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, of prohibiting prescriptions of intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes. See Radice v. State of New York, \n264 U.S. 292\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 325, 68 L. Ed. --.\n It cannot be said that its action in this respect violated any personal rights of the appellants protected by the Constitution. That it did not take their property in violation of the Fifth Amendment, is clear. Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264, 301\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 141, and cases there cited.\n We are unable to say that the provision of the Supplemental Act is an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the power vested in Congress by the Eighteenth Amendment or that it is not 'appropriate legislation' for its enforcement.\n The decrees of the District Court are\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The word 'liquor' is used as meaning 'intoxicating liquor' as defined in the Prohibition Act (title 2,  1 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2]), including beer, ale, porter, and any malt liquor containing one-half of one per centum of alcohol by volume and fit for use for beverage purposes. Supp. Act,  1 (section 10138 4\/5). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In the Everard case the bill prayed that the Supplemental Act be declared unconstitutional; and that the defendants be enjoined from interfering with the plaintiff in manufacturing intoxicating malt liquors for medicinal purposes and selling the same to pharmacists; from interfering with pharmacists in purchasing and physicians in prescribing such liquors for such purposes; and from refusing to issue permits to pharmacists and physicians for such purposes. In the Burke case the bill prayed that the defendants be enjoined from enforcing the Act and Treasury Regulations in so far as they prohibited the plaintiff from selling stout to pharmacists for medicinal purposes; from interfering with the plaintiff in making such sales; and from refusing to issue to the plaintiff and to pharmacists and physicians permits for the sale, purchase and prescribing of such stout. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] In the Everard Case there was no opinion. In the Burke Case, the opinion was mainly based on the earlier opinion of the same court in Piel Bros. v. Day, 278 Fed. 223, which has been affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, per curiam. 281 Fed. 1022.\n In the Burke Case the opinion of Knox, District Judge, reads as follows:\n'Most, if not all of the matters of substance set forth in complainant's bill as a basis for the relief asked, seem to be well within the ruling of Judge Garin in the case of Piel Bros. v. Day, 278 Fed. 223, affirmed in 281 Fed. 1022. So far as the alleged discrimination of the Willis Campbell bill against malt liquors is concerned, I think that in so legislating Congress did not go without the bounds of any constitutional limitation. The within motion will be granted and complainant's bill dismissed.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In its report the Committee said: 'The evidence presented to the committee to the effect that beer has never been recognized as a medicine was overwhelming. The United States Pharmacopoeia has never listed it as a medicine. One hundred and four of the leading physicians and scientists in the Nation signed the following statement: 'The undersigned physicians of the United States desire to place on record their conviction that the manufacture and sale of beer and other malt liquors for medicinal purposes should not be permitted. Malt liquors never have been listed in the United States Pharmacopoeia as official medicinal remedies. They serve no medical purpose which can not be satisfactorily met in other ways, and that without the danger of cultivating the beverage use of an alcoholic liquor.' Several thousand other physicians signed the above, or a similar statement, and presented it to the committee. The attorney for the Anheuser-Busch Co. ( Inc.) appeared before the committee and called attention to the fact that if beer was permitted as a medicine it would be impossible to enforce the prohibition law. There was only one doctor who appeared before the committee in favor of beer as a medicine, and the New York County Medical Association, the official medical association of New York, denied that he spoke for them in favoring beer for medicinal purposes.' \n\n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAMES SHEWAN & SONS v. U S(1924)\nNo. 42\nArgued: October 6, 1924Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 108, 109]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George V. A. McCloskey, of New York City, and C. C. Calhoun, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. J. Frank Staley, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n James Shewan & Sons, a corporation of New York, on the 12th day of May, 1922, filed a libel in admiralty against the United States in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, to recover the value of repairs made during the month of May, 1920, on the steamship Biran. The libel averred that the Biran was owned by the United States and at all the times mentioned was engaged in the mercantile trade, that the lien upon the vessel was one which ordinarily could be enforced in admiralty by proceeding in rem against the vessel.\n The jurisdiction to sue the United States was questioned by exceptive allegations. It was agreed at the hearing that on the 11th day of June, 1921, the steamship Biran, which had theretofore been in the merchant service of the United States, was laid up in the care and custody of caretakers employed by the United States Shipping Board, in the out of use and laid-up fleet of that Board anchored in the Hudson river within the District, and so remained at and after the time when the libel was filed herein, and that since June 11, 1921, it had carried neither crew nor cargo, nor been the subject of any operating \n\n[266 U.S. 108, 110]\n\u00a0\n agreement for use in the merchant or other service, nor had it been transferred by the Shipping Board to any other department or agency of the government. The libelant relied for its right to sue the United States upon the Suits in Admiralty Act (Act March 9, 1920, c. 95, 41 Stat. 525 [ Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1251 1\/4 to 1251 1\/4 l]). That act provides in its first section, with an exception not important here, that no vessel owned by the United States or by any corporation in which the United States owns the capital stock, or in the possession of the United States or of such corporation, or operated by or for the United States or such corporation, shall hereafter, in view of the provision made elsewhere in the act for a libel in personam, be subject to arrest or seizure by judicial process in the United States.\n The second section is in part:\n'That in cases where if such vessel were privately owned or operated, or if such cargo were privately owned and possessed, a proceeding in admiralty could be maintained at the time of the commencement of the action herein provided for, a libel in personam may be brought against the United States or against such corporation, as the case may be, provided that such vessel is employed as a merchant vessel or is a tug boat operated by such corporation.'\n\n The section further provides that such suit shall be brought in the district where the party suing resides or has its principal place of business, or in which the vessel or cargo charged with liability is found.\n The District Court, following Mack Engineering & Supply Co. v. United States (D. C.) 291 F. 713, dismissed the case solely for lack of jurisdiction, because the vessel whose repairs are the subject of this suit was laid up, and was not, when the action commenced, employed as a merchant vessel, and the judge has so certified in this proceeding in error under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n We think this view is based on too narrow a construction of the section. It leads to the result that one who \n\n[266 U.S. 108, 111]\n\u00a0\n repairs a merchant vessel owned by the United States is excluded from the benefit of the act if, immediately after the repairs are made, the United States shall lay her up, although still a merchant vessel in character and without change of her to any other service. If a vessel engaged in the service as a merchant vessel negligently collides with and injures another vessel, and then at once is laid up before suit is brought under this act, the owner of the vessel injured under such construction will have no cause of action against the United States for the injury. This act was enacted chiefly for the purpose of relieving the United States from obstruction to its commercial traffic by the seizure of merchant vessels owned by it or under its control, and was intended to substitute an equivalent remedy against the United States in personam for the right in rem against the vessel, which the act of 1916 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  8146E) had permitted. Blamberg Bros. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 452, 458\n, 459 S., 43 S. Ct. 179. We do not find anything in the act of 1916 which would prevent its liberal construction to enable one who had repaired a vessel engaged solely as a merchant vessel for the United States from proceeding against that vessel in rem under the act of 1916, even though after the repairs had been made upon her as a commercial vessel, she was subsequently laid up, if she had not then acquired character as a public vessel. So we do not think that the decision in The Lake Monroe Case, \n250 \nU.S. 246\n, 39 S. Ct. 460. would have been different had she thus been laid up after she had injured the libelant's vessel in that case. Obviously under the act of 1916, liability to suit of a vessel owned or controlled by the United States as a merchant vessel depended primarily not upon the time when the suit was to be brought and the vessel was to be seized, but upon her character as one solely engaged in merchant service when the transaction occurred out of which the liability grew. \n\n[266 U.S. 108, 112]\n\u00a0\n In view of the purpose of Congress in the act of 1920 merely to substitute an action in rem for an action in personam, the natural construction would be one which, ceteris paribus, would measure the extent of the right to sue the United States in personam by that which had been granted in the act of 1916 to sue in rem its offending or responsible vessel. The date of natural importance in fixing the liability in rem would seem to be that of the event out of which the liability grew. The date of the suit would be important only in the application of a statute of limitation or a change in character of the vessel from that of a merchant vessel to public vessel, or possibly some kind of a change in ownership or the happening of some other circumstance after the event which would exempt the offending vessel if privately owned from seizure under the rules of admiralty law. It is in respect of such changes in the situation before suit that the phrase 'in cases where if such vessel were privately owned ... a proceeding in admiralty could be maintained at the time of the commencement of the action herein provided,' is used, and it does not qualify or in any way add to the force of the subsequent and final proviso 'that such vessel is employed as a merchant vessel or is a tug boat operated by such corporation.'\n What, then, does the proviso mean? Are the words to be construed as if they read 'is being actively employed as a merchant vessel'? Such a construction is a narrow one, and not in accord with the equitable purpose of Congress. The important line between immunity from judicial seizure of government vessels under the act of 1916 was between public vessels and those engaged in merchant service. The mere laying up of a vessel engaged in the latter service would not change its character, unless the government did something affirmative to make it a public vessel. It would have been an unjust result \n\n[266 U.S. 108, 113]\n\u00a0\n to hold that under that act a mere suspension of the vessel's activity in merchant trade destroyed its quasi personal responsibility for its wrongs done or its liabilities incurred in that trade. In view of the relation of the act of 1920 to the act of 1916, unless the words of the proviso of section 2 of the act of 1920 make any other construction unreasonable, the mere laying up of the vessel before suit brought under the act should not prevent a libel in personam against the United States for a claim which under the act of 1916 might be enforced against the vessel itself. The words of the proviso may reasonably and more liberally be interpreted as a limitation that the vessel is a merchant vessel and shall not have lost its character as such. Thus construed, section 2 gives the District Court jurisdiction in such a case as this.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAY BURNS BAKING CO. v. BRYAN(1924)\nNo. 94\nArgued: October 19, 1923Decided: April 14, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 504, 505]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Matthew A. Hall, of Omaha, Neb., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 504, 508]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lloyd Dort, of Lincoln, Neb., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[264 U.S. 504, 510]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An act of the Legislature of Nebraska, approved March 31, 1921 (Laws 1921, c. 2, p. 56)1 provides that every loaf of bread made for the purpose of sale, or offered for sale, or sold, shall be one-half pound, one pound, a pound and a half, or exact multiples of one pound, and prohibits loaves of other weights. It allows a tolerance in excess of the specified standard weights at the rate of two ounces per pound \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 511]\n\u00a0\n and no more, and requires that the specified weight shall be the average weight of not less than 25 loaves, and that such average shall not be more than the maximum nor less than the minimum prescribed. Violations of the act are punishable by a fine or imprisonment.\n Four of the plaintiffs in error are engaged in Nebraska in the business of baking and selling bread for consumption there and in other states. Their total annual output is alleged to be 23,500,000 pounds. The other plaintiff in error is a retail grocer at Omaha, and sells bread to consumers principally in single loaf lots. They brought this suit against the Governor and the secretary of the department of agriculture of the state to restrain the enforcement of the act on the ground, among others, that it is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The state Supreme Court sustained the act. The case is here on writ of error.\n Plaintiffs in error do not question the power of the state to enact and enforce laws calculated to prevent the sale of loaves of bread of less than the purported weight; but they contend that the provision fixing the maximum weights in this statute is unnecessary, unreasonable and arbitrary. \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 512]\n\u00a0\n The brief of the Attorney General states that the law is concerned with weights only. The state Supreme Court said (Jay Burns Baking Co. v. McKelvie, 108 Neb. 674, 678 189 N. W. 383, 385 [26 A. L. R. 24]):\n'It is to prevent a loaf of one standard from being increased in size until it can be readily sold for a loaf of a larger standard that a maximum weight is fixed. The test is reasonableness. ... [Page 679, 189 N. W. 385.] The statutory margin or tolerance being 2 ounces to the pound, can bakers, for example, make a loaf 18 ounces in weight that will weigh not less than 16 ounces 24 hours after it is baked? The tests and proofs on behalf of the state tend to show that the regulation is reasonable and can be observed at all times. [In most of these tests, wrapped loaves were used.] It is fairly inferable from the evidence adduced by plaintiffs that compliance with the regulation is practicable most of the time, but that, tested by their experiments as made, there are periods when the operation of natural laws will prevent compliance with legislative requirements. There are a number of reasons, however, why the tests made to prove unreasonableness should not be accepted as conclusive. If correctly understood these tests were made with bread manufactured in the regular course of business, without any attempt to change ingredients or processes or to retard evaporation of moisture in loaves by the use of waxpaper or other means. ... [Page 680, 189 N. W. 385.] The act of the Legislature does not fix prices but leaves bakers free to make reasonable charges for bread wrapped in inexpensive wax paper for its preservation in transportation and in the markets. ... Precautions to retard evaporation of moisture in bread for the purpose of keeping it in a good state of preservation for 24 hours may be required as an incidental result of a police regulation establishing standards of maximum weights for loaves of bread. Palatableness, a quality demanded by the public, is affected by excessive evaporation, if food value is not. ... The evidence does not prove that, if reasonable means or precautions are taken by plaintiffs \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 513]\n\u00a0\n and other bakers to retard evaporation, they cannot comply with the act of the Legislature, or that the regulation is unreasonable.'\n\n Undoubtedly, the police power of the state may be exerted to protect purchasers from imposition by sale of short weight loaves. Schmidinger v. Chicago, \n226 \nU.S. 578, 588\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 182, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 284. Many laws have been passed for that purpose. But a state may not, under the guise of protecting the public, arbitrarily interfere with private business or prohibit lawful occupations or impose unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions upon them.

The act does not make it unlawful to sell individual loaves weighing more or less than the standard weights respectively. Loaves of any weight may be sold without violation of the act, if the average weight of not less than 25 does not exceed the permitted maximum or fall short of the specified nominal weights during 24 hours after baking. Undoubtedly, very few private consumers purchase at one time as many as 25 loaves of the same standard size or unit. And it is admitted that the sale of a lesser number not within the permitted tolerance does not constitute an offense. Plaintiffs in error do not claim that it is impossible to make loaves which for at least 24 hours after baking will weigh not less than the specified minimum weights, but they insist that the difference permitted \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 514]\n\u00a0\n by the act between the weight of loaves when taken from the oven and their weight 24 hours later is too small, and that it is impossible for bakers to carry on their business without sometimes exceeding the maximum or falling short of the minimum average weights. Any loaves of the same unit at any time on hand during 24 hours after baking may be selected to make up the 25 or more to be weighed in order to test compliance with the act. Therefore, if only a small percentage of the daily output of the loaves in large bakeries shall exceed the maximum when taken from the oven or fall below the minimum weight within 24 hours, it will always be possible to make up lots of 25 or more loaves whose average weight will be above or below the prescribed limits.\n The parties introduced much evidence on the question whether it is possible for bakers to comply with the law. A number of things contribute to produce unavoidable variations in the weights of loaves at the time of and after baking. The water content of wheat, of flour, of dough,2 and of bread immediately after baking varies substantially and is beyond the control of bakers. Gluten is an important element in flour, and flour rich in gluten requires the addition of more water in bread-making and makes better bread than does flour of low or inferior gluten content. Exact weights and measurements used \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 515]\n\u00a0\n in dough-making cannot be attained. Losses in weight while dough is being mixed, during fermentation, and while the bread is in the oven vary, and cannot be avoided or completely controlled. No hard and fast rule or formula is followed in bread-making. There are many variable elements. Bread made from good flour loses more weight by evaporation of moisture after baking than does bread made from inferior flours. Defendants' tests were made principally with loaves which were wrapped so as to retard evaporation; and it was shown that by such wrapping the prohibited variations in weight may be avoided. On the other hand, the evidence clearly establishes that there are periods when evaporation under ordinary conditions of temperature and humidity prevailing in Nebraska exceed the prescribed tolerance and make it impossible to comply with the law without wrapping the loaves or employing other artificial means to prevent or retard evaporation. And the evidence indicates that these periods are of such frequency and duration that the enforcement of the penalties prescribed for violations would be an intolerable burden upon bakers of bread for sale. The tests which were described in the evidence and referred to in the opinion are not discredited because 'made with bread manufactured in the regular course of business.' The reasonableness of the regulation complained of fairly may be measured by the variations in weight of bread so made. The act does not require bakers to select ingredients or to apply processes in the making of bread that will result in a product that will not vary in weight during 24 hours after banking as much as does bread properly made by the use of good wheat flour. As indicated by the opinion of the state Supreme Court, ingredients selected to lessen evaporation after baking would make an inferior and unsalable bread. It would be unreasonable to compel the making of such a product or to prevent making of good bread in order to comply \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 516]\n\u00a0\n with the provisions of the act fixing maximum weights. The act is not a sanitary measure. It does not relate to the preservation of bread in transportation or in the market; and it applies equally whether the bread is sold at the bakeries or is shipped to distant places for sale. Admittedly, the provision in question is concerned with weights only. The act does not regulate moisture content or require evaporation to be retarded by the wrapping of loaves or otherwise. The uncontradicted evidence shows that there is a strong demand by consumers for unwrapped bread. It is a wholesome article of food, and plaintiffs in error and other bakers have a right to furnish it to their customers. The lessening of weight of bread by evaporation during 24 hours after baking does not reduce its food value. It would be unreasonable to prevent unwrapped bread being furnished to those who want it in order technically to comply with a weight regulation and to keep within limits of tolerance so narrow as to require that ordinary evaporation be retarded by wrapping or other artificial means. It having been shown that during some periods in Nebraska bread made in a proper and usual way will vary in weight more than at the rate of 2 ounces to the pound during 24 hours after baking, the enforcement of the provision necessarily will have the effect of prohibiting the sale of unwrapped loaves when evaporation exceeds the tolerance.\n No question is presented as to the power of the state to make regulations safeguarding or affecting the qualities of bread. Concretely, the sole purpose of fixing the maximum weights, as held by the Supreme Court, is to prevent the sale of a loaf weighing anything over 9 ounces for a one pound loaf, and the sale of a loaf weighing anything over 18 ounces for a pound and a half loaf, and so on. The permitted tolerance, as to the half-pound loaf, gives the baker the benefit of only 1 ounce \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 517]\n\u00a0\n out of the spread of 8 ounces, and as to the pound loaf the benefit of only 2 ounces out of a like spread. There is no evidence in support of the thought that purchasers have been or are likely to be induced to take a 9 1\/2 or a 10 ounce loaf for a pound (16-ounce) loaf, or an 18 1\/2 or a 19 ounce loaf for a pound and a half (24-ounce) loaf, and it is contrary to common experience and unreasonable to assume that there could be any danger of such deception. Imposition through short weights readily could have been dealt with in a direct and effective way. For the reasons stated, we conclude that the provision, that the average weights shall not exceed the maximums fixed, is not necessary for the protection of purchasers against imposition and fraud by short weights and is not calculated to effectuate that purpose, and that it subjects bakers and sellers of bread to restrictions which are essentially unreasonable and arbitrary, and is therefore repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs) dissenting.\n The purpose of the Nebraska standard weight bread law is to protect buyers from short weights and honest bakers from unfair competition. It provides for a few standard size loaves, which are designated by weight, and prohibits, as to each size, the baking or selling of a loaf which weighs either less or more than the prescribed weight. Schmidinger v. Chicago, \n226 U.S. 578\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 182, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 284, settled that the business of making and selling bread is a permissible subject for regulation, that the prevention of short weights is a proper end of regulation, that the fixing of standard sizes and weights of loaves is an appropriate means to that end, and that prevalent marketing frauds make the enactment of some such protective legislation \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 518]\n\u00a0\n permissible. The ordinance there upheld, besides defining the standard weight loaf, required that every loaf should bear a label stating the weight, and to sell a loaf weighing less than the weight stated in the label was made a misdemeanor.\n The Nebraska regulation is in four respects less stringent than the ordinance upheld in the Schmidinger Case: (1) It provides for a tolerance; that is, it permits a deviation from the standard weight of not more than 2 ounces in a pound, provided that the prescribed standard weight shall be determined by averaging the weights of not less than 25 loaves of any one unit. (2) The prescribed weight applies for only 24 hours after the baking . (3) The weight is to be ascertained by weighing on the premises where the bread is baked. (4) No label stating the weight is required to be affixed to the loaf; that is, as a representation of the weight, the familiar size of the loaf is substituted for the label. On the other hand, the Nebraska requirement is more stringent than the Chicago ordinance, in that it prohibits making and selling loaves which exceed the prescribed weight by more than the tolerance. This prohibition of excess weights is held to deny due process of law to bakers and sellers of bread. In plain English, the prohibition is declared to be a measure so arbitrary or whimsical that no body of legislators, acting reasonably, could have imposed it. In reaching this conclusion, the court finds specifically that this prohibition 'is not necessary for the protection of purchasers against imposition and fraud by short weights,' that it 'is not calculated to effectuate that purpose,' and that the practical difficulties of compliance with the limitation are so great that the provision 'subjects bakers and sellers of bread to restrictions which are essentially unreasonable and arbitrary.'\n To bake a loaf of any size other than the standard is made a misdemeanor. Why baking a loaf which weighs \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 519]\n\u00a0\n less than the standard size should be made a crime is obvious. Such a loaf is a handy instrument of fraud. Why it should be a crime to bake one which weighs more than the standard is not obvious. The reason given is that such a loaf, also, is a handy instrument of fraud. In order that the buyer may be afforded protection, the difference between the standard sizes must be so large as to be evident and conspicuous. The buyer has usually in mind the difference in appearance between a one-pound loaf and a pound and a half loaf, so that it is difficult for the dealer to plam off the former for the latter. But a loaf weighing one pound and five ounces may look so much like the buyer's memory of the pound and a half loaf that the dealer may effectuate the fraud by delivering the former. The prohibition of excess weight is imposed in order to prevent a loaf of one standard size from being increased so much that is can readily be sold for a loaf of a larger standard size. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n With the wisdom of the legislation we have, of course, no concern. But, under the due process clause as construed, we must determine whether the prohibition of excess weights can reasonably be deemed necessary, whether the prohibition can reasonably be deemed an appropriate means of preventing short weights and incidental unfair practices, and whether compliance with the limitation prescribed can reasonably be deemed practicable. The determination of these questions involves an enquiry into \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 520]\n\u00a0\n facts. Unless we know the facts on which the legislators may have acted, we cannot properly decide whether they were (or whether their measures are) unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious. Knowledge is essential to understanding, and understanding should precede judging. Sometimes, if we would guide by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold. But, in this case, we have merely to acquaint ourselves with the art of bread- making and the usages of the trade, with the devices by which buyers of bread are imposed upon and honest bakers or dealers are subjected by their dishonest fellows to unfair competition, with the problems which have confronted public officials charged with the enforcement of the laws prohibiting short weights, and with their experience in administering those laws.\n First. Why did legislators, bent only on preventing short weights, prohibit also excessive weights? It was not from caprice or love of symmetry. It was because experience had taught consumers, honest dealers, and public officials charged with the duty of enforcing laws concerning weights and measures that, if short weights were to be prevented, the prohibition of excessive weights was an administrative necessity. Similar experience had led to the enactment of a like prohibition of excess quantities in laws designed to prevent defrauding, by short measure, purchasers of many other articles. \n4\n It was similar experience \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 521]\n\u00a0\n which had led those seeking to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquor to enact the law which prohibits the sale of malt liquor, although not containing any alcohol (sustained in Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, \n226 U.S. 192\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 44), and that which prohibits the sale of liquor containing more than one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol (sustained in Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 U.S. 264\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 141). Compare Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, \n240 U.S. 510\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 440, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 548.\n In January, 1858, the late corporation of Washington adopted an ordinance fixing a standard weight loaf, and establishing an excess tolerance. \n5\n The standard weight bread ordinance adopted by Chicago in 1908 and sustained in the Schmidinger Case is said to have been the first standard weight bread law in the United States enacted in this century. \n6\n Prior thereto many different kinds of legislation had been tried in the several states and cities \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 522]\n\u00a0\n with a view to preventing short weights. \n7\n Experience had shown the inefficacy of those preventive measures. Experience under the Chicago ordinance indicated the value of introducing the standard-weight loaf; but it proved, also, that the absence of a provision prohibiting excess weights seriously impaired the efficacy of the ordinance. \n8\n When in 1917 the United States Food Administration was established, pursuant to the Lever Act (Act Aug. 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 e-3115 1\/8 kk, 31151\/8 l-3115 1\/8 r]) the business of baking came under its supervision and control; and provision was made for licensing substantially all bakers. \n9\n The protection of buyers of bread against the fraud of short weights was deemed essential. \n10\n After an investigation which occupied three months, the Food Administration issued the regulations \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 523]\n\u00a0\n by which licensees were to be governed. No standard weight bread statute had then been enacted in \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 524]\n\u00a0\n any state. \n11\n The regulations adopted established standard weight loaves, prohibited the sale of loaves other than of the standard weights, and limited the excess weight to not more than one ounce to the pound. \n12\n This provision remained in force unchanged until the licensing system was abrogated on December 19, 1918 (after the Armistice).13 \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 525]\n\u00a0\n The efficacy of the prohibition of excess weights as a means of preventing short weights having been demonstrated by experience during the period of Food Administration control, a widespread demand arose for legislative action in the several states to continue the protection which had been thus afforded. Dissatisfaction with the old methods of regulation was expressed in a number of states. \n14\n During the years 1919 to 1923, standard weight bread laws, containing the prohibition of excess weights, were enacted in 12 states. \n15\n Similar bills were introduced in others. \n16\n Congress enacted such a law for the \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 526]\n\u00a0\n District of Columbia. \n17\n Hawaii and Porto Rico did likewise. \n18\n The National Conference on Weights and Measures indorsed a similar provision. \n19\n A bill embodying the same principles, applicable to sales of bread in interstate commerce, prepared by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce, was introduced in 1923 and is now pending. \n20\n At the congressional hearings thereon, it was shown that the provisions against excess weights is deemed necessary by a large majority of the bakers, as well as by consumers and by local public officials charged with the duty of preventing short weights. \n21\n In Nebraska the demand for the legislation under review was general and persistent. It was enacted \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 527]\n\u00a0\n after a prolonged public discussion carried on throughout the state as well as in the Legislature. \n22\n Can it be said, in view of these facts, that the legislators had not reasonable cause to believe that prohibition of excess weights was necessary in order to protect buyers of bread from imposition and honest dealers from unfair competition?\n Second. Is the prohibition of excess weights calculated to effectuate the purpose of the act? In other words, is it a provision which can reasonably be expected to aid in the enforcement of the prohibition of short weights? That it has proved elsewhere an important aid is shown by abundant evidence of the highest quality. It is shown by the fact that the demand for the legislation arose after observation of its efficacy during the period of Food Administration control. \n23\n It is shown by the experience \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 528]\n\u00a0\n of the several communities in which the provision has since been in operation: Chicago,24 California,25 Ohio,26 \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 529]\n\u00a0\n Indiana,27 and the District of Columbia. \n28\n The value of the prohibition is shown, also, by the fact that, after \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 530]\n\u00a0\n extensive application and trial, it has been indorsed by the National Conference on Weights and Measures and is included in the proposed 'Federal Bread Law.' Can it be said, in view of these facts, that the Legislature of Nebraska had no reason to believe that this provision is calculated to effectuate the purpose of the standard weight bread legislation?\n Third. Does the prohibition of excess weight impose unreasonable burdens upon the business of making and selling bread? In other words, would compliance involve bakers in heavy costs, or necessitate the employment of persons of greater skill than are ordinarily available? Or would the probability of unintentional transgression be so great as unreasonably to expose those engaged in the business to the danger of criminal prosecution? Facts established by widespread and varied experience of the bakers under laws containing a similar provision, and the extensive investigation and experiments of competent scientists, seem to compel a negative answer to each of \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 531]\n\u00a0\n these questions. But we need not go so far. There is certainly reason to believe that the provision does not subject the baker to an appreciable cost;29 that it does not require a higher degree of skill than is commonly available to bakery concerns;30 and that it does not expose honest \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 532]\n\u00a0\n bakers to the danger of criminal proceedings. \n31\n As to these matters, also, the experience gained during the period of Food Administration control, and since then in the several states, is persuasive. For under the Food Administration, and in most of the states, the business was successfully conducted under provisions for tolerances which were far more stringent than that enacted in Nebraska. In the Food Administration regulation, and in most of the statutes, the tolerance was one ounce in the pound. \n32\n In Nebraska it is two. In some states the weight is taken of the individual loaf. \n33\n In Nebraska it is the average of at least 25 loaves. In some states in which the average weight is taken, it is computed on a less number of loaves than 25.34 In some, where an average of 25 is taken, the tolerance is \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 533]\n\u00a0\n smaller. \n35\n Moreover, even if it were true that the varying evaporation made compliance with the law difficult, a sufficiently stable weight can, confessedly, be secured by the use of oil paper wrapping (now required in several states for sanitary reasons36), which can be inexpensively supplied. \n37\n Furthermore, as bakers are left free to charge for their bread such price as they choose, enhanced cost of conducting the business would not deprive them of their property without due process of law. Can it be said, in view of these facts, that the Legislature of Nebraska had no reason to believe that the excess weight provision would not unduly burden the business of making and selling bread?\n Much evidence referred to by me is not in the record. Nor could it have been included. It is the history of the experience gained under similar legislation, and the results of scientific experiments made since the entry of the judgment below. Of such events in our history, whether occurring before or after the enactment of the statute or of the entry of the judgment, the court should acquire knowledge, and must, in my opinion, take judicial notice, whenever required to perform the delicate judicial task here involved. Compare Muller v. Oregon, \n208 \nU.S. 412, 419\n, 420 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 U.S. 286\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 323, 68 L. Ed. --, No. 163, October term, 1923, decided March 10, 1924. The evidence contained in the record in this case is, however, ample to sustain the validity of the statute. There is in the record some evidence in conflict with it. The Legislature and the lower court have, doubtless, considered that. But \n\n[264 U.S. 504, 534]\n\u00a0\n with this conflicting evidence we have no concern. \n38\n It is not our province to weigh evidence. Put at its highest, our function is to determine, in the light of all facts which may enrich our knowledge and enlarge our understanding, whether the measure, enacted in the exercise of an unquestioned police power and of a character inherently unobjectionable, transcends the bounds of reason; that is, whether the provision as applied is so clearly arbitrary or capricious that legislators acting reasonably could not have believed it to be necessary or appropriate for the public welfare.\n To decide, as a fact, that the prohibition of excess weights 'is not necessary for the protection of the purchasers against imposition and fraud by short weights,' that it 'is not calculated to effectuate that purpose,' and that it 'subjects bakers and sellers of bread' to heavy burdens, is, in my opinion, an exercise of the powers of a super- Legislature-not the performance of the constitutional function of judicial review. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An act establishing a standard weight loaf of bread for the state of Nebraska and providing a penalty. ...\n Section 1.

See Letter of Herbert Hoover to the President, Nov. 6, 1917. They were aided by a consumers' committee. The Food Administration had also the results of an investigation, which had been theretofore conducted by Benj. R. Jacobs of the Bureau of Chemistry, on the marketing of bread in the city of Washington. In his 'Preliminary Report, B. R. Jacobs to Duncan McDuffie, Aug. 14, 1917,' he recommended: 'The standarization of the loaf of bread by weight ... (c) because when weights are declared they are made in such small size type that it is very difficult for the consumer to see it, and also when the weight is declared the bakers seem to enter into an agreement whereby they all mark the same weight on the bread regardless of the size, thus nullifying to a great extent the value of this declaration.'\n The 'Preliminary Report on the Bread Problem, September 29, 1917,' of Duncan McDuffie, includes the following recommendation (page 47). 'The Food Administration is charged, not only with seeing that the public secures its bread at the lowest possible price, but that in making its purchases of this commodity it receives a square deal. In my opinion, both these objects can \n best be obtained by permitting bread to be sold only in units of fixed weight. As these units I recommend loaves weighing, 12 hours after being baked, not less than 16 nor more than 17 ounces, and not less than 24 or more than 25 1\/2 ounces, and multiples of both these weights.'\n Ordinances in force, at that time, in Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Jackson, Minneapolis, Seattle, Tacoma, and Washington, and the statutes of Kansas, Idaho, Nevada, and North Dakota provided for a few standard size loaves; and some of these provided, further, that the loaves must be labeled with the weight, if not in these units. See Appendix. Referring to such regulations, the report says (page 49): 'Many of these regulations permit the manufacture of bread of other sizes provided that bread is labeled with its exact weight. Tolerances are also permitted in some instances on account of shrinkage of weight due to evaporation of the moisture contained in the bread. Many of these regulations provide merely that bread shall not be produced in units weighing less than those fixed. The result of this regulation has been that bakers labeled the bread with the unit weight next below its actual weight, thus making standardization ineffective.\n In many instances these regulations have not produced satisfactory results. This may be attributed to lack of universality, evasion on the part of the baker, or failure of the law to provide an upper as well as a lower limit of weight. There is no reason to think that a regulation, providing that bread shall be sold in units of fixed weight with a limited upward variation to provide for inequalities of evaporation and scaling, if applied universally, will not prove an effective protection of the public and assist in reducing the cost of bread through fixing competition on price alone.'\n See 'Report of the Federal Trade Commission on Bakery Business in United States,' Nov. 3, 1917 made at the request of Mr. Hoover, and published by the United States Food Administration with 'Report of Bakery Section of Food Administration,' November, 1917. In the latter, Duncan McDuffie (pages 20, 21) recommended the following regulation as to weights: 'All bread should be baked in loaves weighing, unwrapped, 12 hours after baking, not less than 16 nor more than 17 and not less than 24 nor more than 25 1\/2 ounces and multiples thereof. Any greater variation in weights than those indicated may defeat the whole object of standardization.' \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See 'Preliminary Report on the Bread Problem, Sept. 29, 1917,' Appendix. In 1616, the California state superintendent of weights and measures promulgated a regulation fixing a standard weight loaf and permitting a tolerance in excess. It was not enforced, because of the opinion expressed by the Attorney General that the regulation was beyond the scope of the official's authority. See 1915-16 Calif. Dept. Weights and Measures, pp. 63-66. In 1917, due to the influence of the bakers of the state, the Legislature passed an amendment to the California weights and measures law which would clearly prevent the state superintendent from fixing a standard weight loaf. An ordinance, fixing a standard weight loaf with an excess tolerance, was prepared by the state superintendent and was 'enacted in all large counties, cities and many towns throughout the state and has been effective in the uniform enforcement of a standard of weight for bread.' 1919-20, op. cit. pp. 30, 31. In 1921, a law was passed incorporating these same features. Act June 2, 1921, c. 704. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] The first 'Rules and Regulations Governing Licensees Manufacturing Bakery Products,' effective December 10, 1917, issued by the United States Food Administration, adopted the recommendation of the November report, which limited the tolerance for excess weights to one ounce in the pound. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] In some other respects, the regulations were changed from time to time. See 'Revised Rules and Regulations,' etc., effective February 1, 1918, pp. 14, 15; 'Special License Regulations, No. XIII, Manufacturers of Bakery Products,' including May 3, 1918, rule 2, p. 8; 'Special License Regulations, No. XIII, Manufacturers of Bakery Products,' Second Issue, effective September 1, 1918, rule 2, p. 5. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Washington changed from a law permitting the sale of any weight bread, provided that it is properly labeled, to a law fixing a standard weight loaf with an excess tolerance. See Laws 1913, c. 52,  9; Laws 1923, c. 126,  1. West Virginia, Utah, Nevada, Detroit, and Milwaukee desire to do likewise. See 1922 W. Va. Dept. Weights and Measures, pp. 14, 15; 1920 Utah Dept.

This standard weight insisted upon by the Food Administration is one of the regulations referred to as having been found so advantageous by the majority of bakers that in a great many cities the rule has been either voluntarily adopted as a sound business practice by the bakers or, at the instance of the trade, has been incorporated into new afterwar bakery laws and regulations.'

Weights and Measures, p. 37: 'The following suggestions in regard to the enforcement of bread legislation, including tolerances, are offered as a result of 5 years' successful enforcement of a standard-weight bread law. The law itself provides that the standard weights of all loaves of bread within 12 hours after baking shall be 16 ounces ... or multiples of the 16-ounce size. A tolerance of 1 ounce above the standard weight is allowed for each 16-ounce unit. No stated tolerance below the standard weight is allowed, for the reason that, were there such a tolerance, certain unscrupulous bakers would not hesitate to scale their bread that amount short. ... In the enforcement of this act we have convicted 25 bakers, $535 in fines being paid, and several thousand loaves of bread confiscated and turned over to charity. It is interesting to note that the act has worked out so successfully, in eliminating the unfair competition of bakers who would cut the price by selling an underweight loaf, that even those firms which were first opposed to the idea of a standard weight bread law are now in favor of it. And I have before me a communication from the secretary of the Southern California Bakers' Association stating that at a meeting of the Wholesale and Retail Bakers' Association a unanimous resolution was passed indorsing this law.' See, also, Bakers' Weekly, Jan. 17, 1920, p. 43. \n[\nFootnote 26\n] See Hearings on H. R. 4533, Feb. 18, 19, 1924, pp. 3-6, 20; also statement of John M. Mote, chief inspector of weights and measures of Ohio, 15 Conf. Weights and Measures, pp. 88, 89, 90, 91:\n'During the period of the war control of the bakers by the United States Food Administration it was clearly demonstrated that it was entirely feasible for bakers to bake loaves to a uniform size, and this is also admitted by the bakers themselves. This indicates that the proposal to standardize the weight of loaves of bread presents no difficulties of manufacture which may not readily be adjusted. ...\n\n'Eight months ago the standard weight bread law became effective in Ohio. We cannot say that this law is perfect in every detail-very few laws are-but we can to-day realize the great benefits of standardization. ... On May 1 a questionaire was mailed to city and county sealers of Ohio, making inquiry as to the attitude of the public and the baking industry relative to the standard weight provision, and every reply brought the answer of complete satisfaction to both bakers and the general public. We cannot find that the standard of quality has been in any way lowered, due to standardization of weight. With only the two factors of quality and price to be considered, the purchasing public is well able to determine for itself the fairness of the prices charged. With hearty cooperation of 98 per cent. of the baking industry, and having the support of the general public, we can safely say this is one of the best statutes enacted in Ohio in recent years.'

The writer says that the law works well and 'rarely do we find an instance in which the standard weight requirement is being violated'; that only one case of short weight had to be prosecuted; that the law itself same into existence through the desire of the bakers of the state for a system 'of control that would elevate the industry by eliminating certain objectionable trade practices'; that the law has placed the industry on a fair basis; that volume of business no longer depends on shrewd, but objectionable, trade practices, but upon quality of product; that the size of the loaf does not grow smaller in greater proportion than the price; that the law has been a protection to the consumers and has the approval of at least 98 per cent. of the bakers. See, also, Bakers' Weekly, Feb. 7, 1920, p. 67. The Indiana Bakers' Association unanimously adopted a resolution expressing satisfaction with the operation of the standard weight bread law of Indiana, and offered their assistance and the benefit of their experience to other states attempting to settle the question.

Roberts, superintendent of weights and measures for the District of Columbia, Hearings on H. R. 4533, Feb. 18, 19, 1924, p. 51: 'I am firmly of the opinion that the law is very well enforced in the District of Columbia. ... I had totaled up the other day a list of weights that came into my office in one day, for 200 and some odd loaves, I think it was 250 loaves, and, of course, the weights would vary a little; but I do not believe that there were a dozen of those loaves that were out of the legal tolerance. My recollection is that none of them were out more than one-tenth of an ounce. The average weight was 16.03 ounces. That indicates to my mind how the law is being observed here. The bakers generally, while they are opposed to the law, were very much disturbed when the law was first passed, and made strenuous efforts to have it amended. Congress did not amend it. So far as I know the law has proven very satisfactory. I cannot speak for the bakers, but I do not recall that I have ever had a complaint come into my office from a consumer about the law. They seem to be very well satisfied and the law is very well observed. The bakers have gone along and observed the law very well. We have found it necessary to institute very few prosecutions, and those only for very minor infractions of the law against a few small bakers. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] Standard weight legislation does away with the necessity for frequent pan changes. See Bakers' Weekly, Nov. 29, 1919, p. 37. The prevailing bread prices in Ohio and Indiana are 8 cents for a 16-ounce loaf and 12 cents for a 24-ounce loaf. In New York, the same prices are charged for loaves running two ounces short on the average. See Hearings on H. R. 4533, Feb. 18, 19, 1924, pp. 3, 8. Prevailing bread prices in Wisconsin are 7-10 cents for the 16-ounce loaf and 10-15 cents for a 24- ounce loaf; California, 7 1\/2-9 cents and 10-13 cents; District of Columbia, 9 cents and 13 cents; Chicago, 8 cents and 12 cents; Texas, 8 cents; and Washington, 10 cents and 15 cents. But in Iowa the prices in the larger cities are 9 cents and 12 cents for a 16-ounce and 24-ounce loaf, and in the smaller cities 8-10 cents for a 14-ounce loaf and 13 cents for a 20-ounce loaf; Idaho, 10 cents and 15 cents; Nevada, 10 cents and 15 cents; Virginia, 9 cents and 16 cents (18 ounces). See information received by Director, Bureau of Standards, Dec. 1923-Jan., 1924, on file March 25, 1924. \n[\nFootnote 30\n] While there are a large number of uncertain factors connected with the art of bread-making, reasonable legislation fixing standard weights is practicable. See C. J. Kremer, 'Bread Weight Legislation and Retail Bakers,' 16 Conf. Weights and Measures, p. ___. At the hearings on the 'Federal Bread Bill' this was not disputed. See Hearings on H. R. 4533, March 3, 1924. It is generally conceded that the baker can predetermine with great accuracy the weight of a loaf of bread immediately after baking. See 14 Conf. Weights and Measures, p. 77; 15 Conf. Weights and Measures, pp. 80- 84. Neither can it be reasonably contended that a 2-ounce tolerance is not enough to cover shrinkage after baking. For, pursuant to a resolution adopted at the Fourteenth Conference on Weights and Measures (page 87), a series of scientific experiments were conducted. See 15 Conf. Weights and Measures, pp. 80-84. The committee on specifications and tolerances recommended to the conference a tolerance not in excess of the one here allowed. See Id. p. 79. An investigation on the shrinkage of white bread, conducted in the District of Columbia by the Bureau of Standards, showed that the shrinkage, during the first 24 hours, from a one-pound loaf, round top, not wrapped, was 4.4 per cent.; round top, wrapped, 2.7 per cent.; lunch, not wrapped, 5.7 per cent.; one and one half pound loaf, round top, not wrapped, 4.1 per cent.; and round top unwrapped, 3 per cent. See Hearings on H. R. 4533, Feb. 18, 19, 1924, pp. 62-64. On file at the Bureau of Standards, March 15, 1924, is a record of a large number of experiments conducted in Chicago to the same effect.

It is interesting to note that none of the writers contend that the tolerance provision is unreasonable. See, also, Hearings on H. R. 4533, Mar. 3, 1924. There is a great contrariety of opinion among bakers themselves as to the advisability of the legislation and the limits of a reasonable tolerance. 'Tolerances of some kind are absolutely necessary, but in view of the conflicting opinion of bakers, weights and measures officials, chemists and others interested in solving the problem, a 'reasonable' tolerance is about as hard to determine as the traditional age of Ann.'

SEIBERLING(1924)\nNo. 185\nArgued: Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n Messrs. Livingston Gifford, of New York City, and Thomas G. Haight, of Jersey City, N. J., for petitioner.\n Mr. Melville Church, of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 321]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to enjoin the infringement of a patent for the making of the outer shoes or casings of pneumatic automobile tires, composed of woven fabric treated with rubber. We have brought it here because of a conflict of opinion between the Circuit Courts of Appeals of the Sixth and the Third Circuits.\n The suit in each circuit was begun by Frank A. Seiberling, as assignee. That in the Sixth Circuit was filed in 1914 against the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, and was based on alleged infringement of 3 claims of a patent to Seiberling and Stevens, No. 762,561, of June 14, 1904, and 16 claims of a patent to one State, No. 941,962, dated November 30, 1909. The District Judge found both patents valid and infringed. 234 Fed. 370. The Firestone Company appealed, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court, holding that all the claims of the State patent were invalid, and that, of the 3 claims of the Seiberling and Stevens patent, 2 were invalid and 1 was not infringed. 257 Fed. 74, 168 C. C. A. 286. The bill in the case before us was brought in 1914 in district of New Jersey on the same two patents. After the decision in the Sixth Circuit in December, 1918, the plaintiff, Seiberling, filed in the Patent Office a disclaimer absolute as to 8 claims of the State patent and qualified as to the other 11. No proofs were made in this case to sustain suit upon the Seiberling and Stevens patent; State, the patentee of the other patent, having testified that it had failed. The District Judge dismissed the bill on the ground that the effect of the disclaimers on the State patent was to change it from a machine patent, and to make it a method or process \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 322]\n\u00a0\n patent, and that the method was old. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, a majority of that court held that the record herein in respect to the State patent was substantially different from that in the Sixth Circuit, and that the State patent was qualified by the disclaimers was valid and infringed. 284 Fed. 746. The third judge dissented, on the ground that the disclaimers were of such a character as not to be permitted by the statute.\n The making of rubber tires for automobiles began by hand, and the proof seems to show that, while power and complicated mechanism have been applied to secure much greater speed in production and possibly greater uniformity in the product, there is even now no successful device for their completely automatic manufacture.\n A hand tire was framed on an annular metallic core of the proper size, with spokes and a hub mounted and revolving on a shaft. It was made up of layers of fabric stuck together by a proper adhesive material and formed into a tube with a narrow opening on the inside, called the bead. The ends of the tube were united together to make it circular and endless. The layers were arranged to give a solid rubber tread along the outer periphery to make contact with the road. The workman began by coating the core with a suitable cement, and affixed a strip of the rubber impregnated fabric, stretching it and cutting it so as to cover the circumference of the core. In width it was somewhat less than enough to cover the sides of the core. He then revolved the core slowly, patting and stretching the woven strip on it, pressing and shaping it with his fingers and hand tools, so that it adhered smoothly to the core without wrinkles. He followed this with another strip of fabric, attaching it to the one before by the rubber cement. This operation he repeated with as many layers as were needed.\n The strips of the fabric were cut on the bias, and the warp threads of one strip, when set in place, were intended \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 323]\n\u00a0\n to run from one inner open edge or bead, in a diagonal course, along, across, and around the tube, to its other open edge or bead. The next strip or layer was reversed, so that its warp threads crossed those of the first strip at a selected angle.\n There was no difficulty in making the part of the layer on the tread easy and smooth, because the curvature there was small, but, as the fabric was pressed against the sides and inside of the core, it tended to bagginess, and did not lie so smoothly. It would gather and wrinkle. This, if carried into the permanent condition of the fabric, would greatly weaken the tire. The tendency of woven material, however, is to contract in one direction as it stretches in another. The fabric lengthens circumferentially as it is stretched on the outer periphery. The square meshes thus become diamond-shaped along the tread. There is a corresponding longitudinal contraction in the fabric as it is stretched laterally down the sides, so that its shrinking will be greatest as the edges are approached. Thus the wrinkling and bagginess of the fabric may by proper treatment with hand and tool be made to disapper, and the strip be shaped smoothly to the sides and beads of the core surface.\n At first, the skirts of the fabric were stretched radially along the sides of the core, and treated by a saw-tooth tool to avoid wrinkles, and then a spinning roll or wheel was spun along the fabric down the core side in a spiral course. There was thus given to the fabric what was called the double stretch, and this was supposed to give greater strength and smoothness to the fabric as set upon the core. The workmen, however, found that they could work more rapidly and with less pains, if they gave up the saw-tooth stretch and depended only on the use of the spinning wheel, with which, by increasing the hand speed of the core, they could smooth the fabric against the core without wrinkles. The spinning or stitching of the sides \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 324]\n\u00a0\n by the rapid revolution of the core had been previously shown in the kindred art of shaping thin metal sheets over a power driven core. The evidence was that rotation of the core by hand to a speed of 50 or 60 revolutions a minute would give a centrifugal tendency to the skirt of the fabric, keeping it away from the core. By thus doing what the foreman of the shops at first deprecated, the workmen developed a successful improvement in the hand making of tires. The spinning was usually done one side at a time; but powerful workmen were known to work the spinning wheels together on both sides of the core. The spinning of the fabric by rotating the core rapidly was more usual in tires of smaller sizes, because the fabric was so stiff that such a method by hand in larger tires was impracticable.\n One of the early power machines to make tire casings was patented to Moore in 1894. It disclosed an expansible core, upon which an endless rubber fabric was placed and stretched. The core was rotated rapidly by power, and the fabric was rolled down by a set of rollers, of which one was a spinning roller. This was pivoted to swing radially toward the core, but the handle of the spinning wheel was so fixed that it could not travel as far down as the bead.\n The Seiberling and Stevens patent of 1904 for making tires sought to do the work of fitting the fabric to the core wholly by machinery; i. e., automatically without the intervention of the hand of the operator. It comprised--\n First. A main power-driven shaft, to drive the core capable of low or quick revolutions, or entire release;\n Second. A reel, carrying the rubber impregnated strip;\n Third. A tension roller, retarding the reel and stretching the fabric on the periphery after the free end is attached to the core;\n Fourth. A pressure roller, concave in form, to match the tread of the strip and press it to the core as it revolves; \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 325]\n\u00a0\n Fifth. An arm, carrying a laterally springpressed finger, called a jigger finger, intended to be reciprocated rapidly, radially of the core, traveling in and out between the tread and in its outer edge, functioning like a human finger in pressing the fabric down against the core and stretching it into shape; and\n Sixth. A further pressure wheel or spinning roller, applied along the edge of the fabric to press it into a crease. The spinning roller was set in a plane at a receding angle to the plane of the core.\n The evidence in this record shows that Seiberling and Stevens' device was not successful in its operation, and that the automatic operation of the finger was not effective.\n The Vincent patent of 1905 had a powerdriven core, to draw and stretch the fabric, with guide rolls through which the fabric was led on its way to the core, and which were geared so as to resist the pull of the fabric. As soon as the fabric was spread circumferentially on the core, its skirts or edges were formed down the sides by two sets of spring- actuated hammers, arranged progressively in a radial direction, so that as the core rotated the fabric was tapped on the sides from their outer portion inwardly toward the bead. This device seems to have had considerable commercial use.\n The Mathern Belgian patent of 1906 had a core arranged to be power- driven at high and low speeds, effected by changing gears; the ratio between the two being 20 to 1. It had a stock roll from which the fabric passed at a tension around guide rolls and between conical gears, to secure uniform puckers in the outer edges of the fabric, and to hold it out from the core as its middle is delivered circumferentially to become the tread. A screw-fed slide was arranged to be moved radially to the core, having suspended on pins a pair of spinning rolls, the handles of which enable the operator to press them laterally against \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 326]\n\u00a0\n the skirts of the fabric on the core during their inward radial movement.\n The Belgian Mathern pattern is attacked as a paper patent, because it was allowed to expire through failure to pay the annual Belgian tax. The evidence shows, however, that in 1911 it was offered commercially to the Hood Company, which preferred a German patent of the same inventor, and the Belgian machine was actually used for the making of tires which proved to be commercially satisfactory. We do not doubt from the record that it was a practical tire-making machine.\n The State patent was applied for March 26, 1909. It was of the same general type as that of Seiberling and Stevens. State's most substantial change was that he discarded the reciprocal, spring-pressed, in and out forming finger of Seiberling and Stevens, and substituted spring-pressed spinning rolls, which he supplemented with stitching rolls, if needed. He provided, in the same general way as Seiberling and Stevens, a core, a fabric reel, a retarding or tension device, whereby he attached his strip of fabric to the core for the width of the tread portion, leaving the skirts or wings projecting outwardly. Fixed to the base of the frame carrying the core was a standard, traveling in a horizontal track with a turret, having four tools mounted at four equidistant points and independent of each other, except for their common base. One carried a tread roller, the second the spinning rollers, the third the stitching rolls, and the fourth the bead-attaching rolls. The operator revolved the turret, so as to make the tread roller bear against the tread on the core, then the spinning roll device, then the stitching roll, and then the bead- forming roll, the latter two of which were not always used. There was no real combination of the operation of the four tools. It was an aggregation not different from a successive use by an operator of hand tools, and so the Circuit Court of Appeals \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 327]\n\u00a0\n of the Sixth Circuit held. This was what led to the disclaimer of 8 of the claims. It possibly gave the change in the character of the record and proof in this case from that in the Sixth Circuit, as remarked upon by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit.\n Eleven claims are left. While qualified by disclaimers, consideration of the original claims will serve our purpose. Claims 4, 5, 6, and 7 are for combinations of a sheet fabric supply, a power-driven ring core, a radially moving support laterally spring-pressed toward the core, with a spinning roll mounted on the support to shape the sheeted fabric to the core. The variety in the claims is in adding to the spinning roll the element of a receding angle to the plane of the core in the fifth; in giving the spinning roll a round disk-shaped edge in the sixth; in giving both the receding angle and the disk-shaped edge to the spinning roll in the seventh.\n Claims 12 and 13 comprise in their combinations all the above and the slow-speed mechanism for actuating the core when the fabric is received from the stock roll, and the high-speed mechanism for the spinning rolls to pass over the fabric on the core and shape it.\n Claims 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26 cover the same combinations, save that they emphasize the feature of the radially moving support of the spinning roll, which is power-pressed toward the core.\n There was no novelty in the combination of a power-operated core with fabric rolls for delivering the rubber impregnated strips through tension rolls to the core, or in the use of pressure rolls to stretch and press the tread at the slow speed of the core followed by the spinning of the stretching or spinning rolls with high speed down the sides from the outer line of the tread to the bead edge of the fabric, or in the use of the tangential force upon the skirts of the fabric to keep them away from the core. The use of power to revolve the core was seen \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 328]\n\u00a0\n in earlier patents in Seiberling and Stevens, in Vincent, and in the Belgian Mathern. The change of gears from slow to rapid revolution, by shifting of the gears, was shown in the first and third of these. The receding angle of the spinning roller to the plane of the core was not new with State. It was seen in Seiberling and Stevens.\n The operation of the spinning wheel in the State patent is said to be automatic. We do not find it to be so. It is partly automatic, in that the spinning rolls, when properly placed, are brought closer to the fabric by the springs. The Belgian Mathern device is partly automatic in an analogous way. But, when the process of spinning is carried to its completion, the adjustment and pressure of the wheels to the fabric as it approaches the bead edge need the hand of the operator, just as in the hand-making of tires. It is true that the spinning rolls in all these patents are steadied against the fabric in one way or another, as by the power-pressed radially moving support in the State patent; but in the end the hand is needed to complete the spinning process as it nears the bead edge. We do not think that the use of the springs by State in such a combination involves patentable invention, when we weigh its inconsiderable importance and note the suggestion of the use of such springs for analogous purposes in Vincent, and in Seiberling and Stevens.\n The change from hand to the use of machinery often involves invention. In the making of tires, it has in fact resulted because of the use of power, in speed of manufacture, and possibly in some greater uniformity of the product. But the record does not show that there has been substantial change in the mechanics or method of making. The steps are the same, and the succession from one to the other are as in the manual art, and the transfer from hand to power was by the usual appliances, and had all been indicated before the State patent. \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 329]\n\u00a0\n These conclusions as to the lack of novelty in the elements and combinations of the State patent were reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and we agree with them.\n The majority opinion of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in this case attributed much importance and novelty to the effect of the centrifugal force of the revolving core upon the fabric. Its view was that State had discovered that the fabric was thus substantially stretched radially as the spinning wheels hinged against the flowing fabric, and the square meshes on the sides were elongated substantially by the centrifugal force, so that at the bead they were lozenge shaped and easily smoothed. We do not find such a new result, or anything different from what was shown in the making of tires by hand. If there were such a newly developed, substantial addition to the stretching of the material by tangential force, it must have occurred in the Mathern Belgian patent before State. But we find it in neither. The discovery of such a new source of radial stretching power is not testified to by the experts in either hearing.\n We are pressed with the argument that many tires, reaching into the millions, have been made under a license granted by Seiberling, and that the success of the device shows the utility and novelty of what he licensed. He gave to his licensees, not only the use of State patent, but also that of Seiberling and Stevens patent. Both patents made large and sweeping claims, which were well calculated to induce acquiescence by those without sufficient knowledge of the prior art or adequate capital to resist. Yet the more comprehensive claims of the State patent have now been disclaimed, and the Seiberling and Stevens patent included in his licenses has been abandoned. There has been a complete change about in the Third Circuit lawsuit. Mr. Seiberling, when these licenses were \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 330]\n\u00a0\n granted, was at the head of the great Goodyear Company. He could give great vogue to a device owned and used by him. The license was not a heavy tax, equal to less than 1 per cent. of the cost of a machine, and purchase of peace was a wise course for the smaller manufacturer. Evidence of this kind is often very persuasive, especially when patentable novelty is in doubt. Potts v. Creager, \n155 \nU.S. 597, 609\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 194; Magowan v. New York Belting Co., \n141 \nU.S. 332, 343\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 71. But it is by no means conclusive, and must be weighed in the light of all the circumstances, to accord to it its proper significance. Eibel Co. v. Paper Co., \n261 \nU.S. 45, 56\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 322; McClain v. Ortmayer, \n141 \nU.S. 419, 428\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 76. In the case before us, we do not think it can overcome the lack of novelty and invention.\n Seiberling disclaimed combination claims of 4, 5, 6, and 7, except when constructed and co-ordinated in a certain way. He disclaimed claims 12 and 13, except for the combined operations of a certain kind, and unless the recited elements were constructed and co-ordinated as he described. He disclaimed claims 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26, except when constructed and co-ordinated for a particular purpose and unless the power drive functioned as he pointed out. As we have found that there is nothing really new in the method or mechanism of State, it will serve no purpose to go through the qualifying disclaimers in detail and consider their effect.\n The disclaimers are attacked on the ground that they exceed the legal function of a disclaimer, and are an attempt to change a mechanical patent to a process or method patent, something which could only be properly accomplished by a reissue. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit examined the possibility of sustaining the alleged invention of State as a process of method patent, but concluded that it was fully anticipated by the method of making tires by hand. We do not find it \n\n[264 U.S. 320, 331]\n\u00a0\n necessary to pass upon the validity of the method of making disclaimers here pursued, because we agree with the Sixth Circuit Court in failing to find invention in the State device either as a mechanical or as a method patent.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court, with directions to dismiss the bill. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJONES v. UNION GUANO CO(1924)\nNo. 73\nArgued: October 15, 1923Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 171, 172]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. C. Jerome, of High Point, N. C., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 171, 176]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis M. Swink and W. M. Hendren, both of Winston-Salem, N. C ., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error brought this action in the superior court of Rockingham county to recover damages alleged to have resulted to his tobacco crop from the use of fertilizer manufactured and sold by defendant in error. A state law (section 7, chapter 143, Laws of 1917) provides that no such action shall be brought until after chemical analysis showing the ingredients of the fertilizer. The plaintiff in error failed to meet this requirement, and, notwithstanding evidence tending to show inferior quality of and deleterious ingredients in the fertilizer and injury to the crop resulting from its use, the court dismissed the case and entered judgment of nonsuit. The Supreme Court of the state affirmed the judgment. 183 N. C. 338, 111 S. E. 612. The question here is whether the state law so applied is repugnant to the due process clause or equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[264 U.S. 171, 177]\n\u00a0\n The facts alleged and on which plaintiff in error seeks to recover are these. In the spring of 1919, he purchased 51 bags of fertilizer upon the representation and warranty of defendant in error that it was good for and conducive to the growth of tobacco. The weather was propitious, the plants were good and properly set out, and the land was properly tilled. The fertilizer contained deleterious ingredients not available as food for plants, and killed or prevented the growth of tobacco. There was produced 4,469 pounds of tobacco, on which, by reason of inferior quality, there was a loss of 30 cents a pound, $1,340.70, and in addition to the actual yield there should have been produced 5,281 pounds, of the value of 70 cents per pound, $3,696.70, making total damages alleged $5,037.40.\n In North Carolina commercial fertilizer is generally used for the production of crops. Prior to the passage of the act, litigation between the users and sellers of fertilizers, involving demands for damages for injuries to crops alleged to have resulted from the use thereof, became a matter of public concern affecting, or liable to affect, the general welfare. \n1\n In earlier cases, the Supreme Court of the state held the measure of damages to be the difference between the actual value and the purchase price of fertilizer, and denied recovery for diminution of crops on the ground that such a claim necessarily must be speculative. Fertilizer Works v. McLawhorn (1912) 158 N. C. 274, 73 S. E. 883. Later recovery for diminution of crops was permitted. Tomlinson v. Morgan (1914) 166 N. C. 557, 82 S. E. 953; Carter v. McGill (1915) 168 N. C. 507, 84 S. E. 802, on rehearing (1916) 171 \n\n[264 U.S. 171, 178]\n\u00a0\n N. C. 775, 89 S. E. In Hampton Guano Co. v. Live Stock Co. (1915) 168 N. C. 442, 448, 84 S. E. 774, 776 (L. R. A. 1915D, 875), where the contract of sale of fertilizer contained a warranty that the seller should not be held responsible for results in actual use, the court said:\n'The warranty was drawn for the very purpose of preventing the recovery of such damages as are, in their nature, very speculative, if not imaginary, and out of all proportion to the amount of money or price received by the seller for the fertilizer. If fertilizer companies can be mulcted in damages for the failure of the crop of every farmer who may buy from them, they would very soon be driven into insolvency or be compelled to withdraw from the state, as the aggregate damages, if the supposed doctrine be carried to its logical conclusion, would be ruinous, and the farmers in the end would suffer incalculable harm.'\n\n In 1917 the state Legislature dealt with the situation and passed the act above referred to, comprehensively regulating fertilizers. Among other provisions, to prevent deception and fraud, it requires that before sale there shall be attached to each package a brand name, which is required to be registered with the state department of agriculture, the weight, the name, and address of the manufacturer, and the guaranteed analysis, giving the percentage of valuable constituents-phosphoric acid, nitrogen (or equivalent in ammonia), and potash. Change of a registered brand to a lower grade is forbidden. The use of the terms 'high grade' and 'standard' is regulated, and minimum percentages of valuable constituents are prescribed for each grade. Deleterious substances are prohibited. Fertilizers offered for sale or sold contrary to the provisions of the act are liable to be seized and condemned. Penalties are prescribed for violations of the act or of the rules and regulations of the department made to carry it into to effect. Whenever the commissioner of agriculture shall be satisfied that any fertilizer 15 5 per cent. below the guaranteed value in plant food, it is his \n\n[264 U.S. 171, 179]\n\u00a0\n duty to require that twice the value of the deficiency shall be made good by the manufacturer to one who has purchased such fertilizer for his own use. If 10 per cent. below, it is the duty of the commissioner to require three times the value of such deficiency to be paid to the consumer. If the deficiency is due to intention of the manufacturer to defraud, then there shall be collected from him double the amounts above stated. If the manufacturer resists payment, the commissioner is required to publish the analysis in an official bulletin and also in one or more newspapers. The department is required to have sufficient chemists and assistants and the necessary equipment to enable it promptly to make a report of the chemical analyses of all samples sent by purchasers or consumers. It is authorized to collect and analyze fertilizer offered for sale in the state. Samples for analysis are required to be taken from at least 10 per cent. of the lot, but from not less than 10 bags of any lot or brand. The drawing of samples is safeguarded by the act, and the department is authorized to make additional rules and regulations for taking and forwarding them to the department. No sample shall be taken after 30 days from the actual delivery to the consumer except by the state inspector. It provides ( section 7) that in the trial of any case where the value or composition of any fertilizer is called in question, a certificate of the state chemist, setting forth the analysis made by him--\n'of any sample of said fertilizer drawn under the provisions of this chapter, ... shall be prima facie proof that the fertilizer was of the value and constituency shown by his said analysis: ... Provided further, that no suit for damages from results of use of fertilizer may be brought except after chemical analysis showing deficiency of ingredients, unless it shall appear to the department of agriculture that the manufacturer of said fertilizer in question has, in the manufacture of other goods offered in this state during such season, employed such ingredients \n\n[264 U.S. 171, 180]\n\u00a0\n as are outlawed by the provisions of this act, or unless it shall appear to the Department of Agriculture that the manufacturer of such fertilizer has offered for sale during that season any kind of dishonest or fraudulent goods. That nothing in this act shall impair the right of contract.'\n\n It is not contended that the provision making the certificate of the state chemist prima facie evidence is invalid. \n2\n The contention is that the act arbitrarily substitutes the determination of an executive department for a judicial inquiry, and has the effect of abolishing all remedies against manufacturers of fertilizer for damages caused by the use of inferior or deleterious fertilizer, and is therefore repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The act does not deprive purchasers of any right or cause of action. On the contrary, it gives additional rights and remedies to one who purchases for his own use fertilizer below the guaranteed value in plant food. The terms of the statute are not made exclusive. Under the act the parties were free to deal on other terms. Fertilizer Works v. Aiken (1918) 175 N. C. 398, 402, 95 S. E. 657; Fertilizing Co. v. Thomas (1921) 181 N. C. 274, 283, 106 S. E. 835. The ingredients of fertilizers can be ascertained definitely by chemical analysis. The department is required to provide chemists and equipment and to make and report analyses of all fertilizers sent in by purchasers or consumers. The requirement imposed is reasonable and seems well calculated to safeguard against uncertainty, conjecture and mistake. The analysis is not made conclusive. Other \n\n[264 U.S. 171, 181]\n\u00a0\n evidence may be introduced by either party. The determination of the department is not substituted for a trial in court.\n The Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent a state from prescribing a reasonable and appropriate condition precedent to the bringing of a suit of a specified kind or class so long as the basis of distinction is real, and the condition imposed has reasonable relation to a legitimate object. See Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 155\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 255; Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 337\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 124. We think it plain that actions to recover damages to crops resulting from the use of fertilizers may reasonably be distinguished from other damage suits. Crops depend on the kind and condition of the soil, the vitality of seeds sown or plants set out, the cultivation and care given, the weather and many other things, as well as the kind and amount of the fertilizer applied. The amount or quality of the yield cannot be known in advance. When good results are not obtained, it is impossible to discover the causes and determine how much of the shortage, whether of quantity or kind, properly may be attributed to any particular thing. In such actions, peculiar difficulties attend the ascertainment of the constituent elements of the fertilizer used, and the determination whether it is inferior in quality or contains ingredients that are deleterious or harmful to plant growth. To attempt to establish the kind or quality of fertilizer applied to the land by an inspection of the crop growing thereon, or by the result of the season's planting and effort is to indulge in speculation and conjecture. A state has power to provide for and require a more definite method of ascertaining the essential facts and a better basis upon which judicial determinations may be made.\n The provision of the state law here under attack is not repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Carson v.

ROAD DISTRICT(1924)\nNo. 33\nArgued: Decided: May 1, 1924\n\n\n December 15, 1924 \n\n[266 U.S. 379, 380]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel W. Moore, of New York City, James B. McDonough, of Ft. Smith, Ark., and F. H. Moore and A. F. Smith, both of Kansas City, Mo., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Hal L. Norwood, of Mena, Ark., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents a controversy over the constitutional validity of an assessment of benefits accruing to railway property from the improvement of a public road in Sevier county, Ark. \n\n[266 U.S. 379, 381]\n\u00a0\n The road reaches from De Queen, the county seat, to the eastern border of the county, 18 miles. It had been a mere dirt road, not good in any season, and impassable at times. The improvement consisted in reducing objectionable curves and grades, installing modern bridges and culverts, reconstructing the roadbed, putting on a hard and durable surface, and generally fitting the road for economical and expeditious rural travel and transportation. To accomplish the improvement a road district covering approximately 3 miles of territory on either side of the road was created under a general law of the state. Section 5399 et seq., Crawford & Moses' Digest 1921. Money to pay the cost of the improvement, estimated at $200, 000, was to be obtained primarily through an issue of interest-bearing bonds and ultimately through a special tax spread over a period of 20 years. The tax was to be laid on all lands, town lots, railroads, and other real property within the district, in the proportions in which they would be benefited by the improvement. Assessors appointed by the county court were to assess the benefits and to set forth in their report the name of the owner of each parcel, a description of the property, its 'present assessed value' for general taxing purposes, and the amount of benefits assessed to it. When completed the assessment was to be filed in the county court, a time for hearing parties in interest was to be fixed, and public notice thereof was to be given. The court was to review the work of the assessors, and to equalize, lower, or raise the assessment of benefits to particular parcels as justice might require. An appeal could be taken to the circuit court, which was to give a hearing de novo in respect of such objections as were set forth in the affidavit for appeal, and a further appeal could be taken to the Supreme Court of the state. A comprehensive statement of the various steps to be taken in the proceedings and of their nature is given in Commissioners, etc., v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 547\n, 42 S. Ct. 250. \n\n[266 U.S. 379, 382]\n\u00a0\n Within the road district, at De Queen, are 2 miles of main track, 9 miles of side tracks, a depot, and other buildings, which form part of a railway line, called the Kansas City Southern, which extends from Kansas City, Mo., to Port Arthur, Tex. The assessed value for general taxing purposes of this railway property within the district was $129,615. The district assessors assessed it with benefits amounting to $21,270, or approximately 16 per cent. of its assessed value. The assessed value of the farm lands and town lots within the district for general taxing purposes was $897,660. The district assessors assessed them with benefits amounting to $448,354, or approximately 54 per cent. of their assessed value. Other property in the district, not requiring special notice here, was assessed with benefits amounting to $40,409. Thus the aggregate of the benefits assessed was $510,033. The special tax amounted to 70 per cent. of the benefits assessed, or 3 1\/2 per cent. per annum for 20 years-the full tax being intended to cover the bond issue, with interest. The portion of the tax laid on the railway property was $14,899, or $744.45 per annum.\n In regular course the assessment was reviewed by the county court and confirmed, the court finding that the lands and other real property in the district would be 'greatly benefited' by the improvement and that the assessment of benefits was 'fair, just, and equal to all landowners.'\n Two companies interested in the railway property appealed to the circuit court, and in the affidavit for appeal assailed the assessment, in so far as it affected them, on the grounds, first, that it was purely arbitrary, and therefore in contravention of the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, because the railway property neither would nor could receive any benefit from the improvement of the road; secondly, that it was not in accord with the equal \n\n[266 U.S. 379, 383]\n\u00a0\n protection clause of that amendment, because the railway property on the one hand, and the farm lands and town lots on the other, were assessed with benefits in grossly unequal proportions, to the detriment of the railway property; and, thirdly, that it was made in disregard of the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, because the benefits assessed to the railway property were not such as would or could accrue to that property, but were such as would accrue, if accruing at all, to the interstate business in which that property was being used, and therefore could not be made the basis of a special improvement tax without burdening interstate commerce.\n While the appeal was pending in the circuit court the state Legislature passed a special act (No. 98, approved February 7, 1920) recognizing the creation and boundaries of the district, approving the plans for the improvement of the road, confirming the assessment of benefits as sustained by the county court, and declaring that the assessment 'fairly represents the benefits that will accrue' to the railway property and other tracts in the district. The companies then took the position that the legislative confirmation was open to the same constitutional objections that were made to the original assessment.\n A hearing was had in the circuit court, at which the companies assumed the burden of establishing that their objections were well founded, in so far as they turned on matters of fact. Much evidence was produced on both sides. The greater part was addressed to the question whether the railway property within the district would receive any substantial benefit from the improvement. The witnesses differed pronouncedly. Some expressed positive opinions on the subject, without advancing anything of substance in support of their opinions This was true to a greater degree of the witnesses for the companies than of those for the district. Some of the latter referred \n\n[266 U.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n to and detailed conditions and transactions tending to give their opinions strong support. Among other things, they testified that theretofore the lands in the vicinity of the road had necessarily been put to uses which made only a light contribution to the tonnage and business of the railway; that the lands were naturally well adapted to other uses, such as growing fruits and vegetables, but could not profitably be used for these purposes in the absence of road facilities for getting the products to places of shipment expeditiously and without injury from jolting; that when plans for the improvement of the road were adopted fruit growing and truck farming began to displace the prior uses; that at the time of the hearing, which was after one-half of the road was completed and the rest graded, the new crops were being grown and sent to distant markets in large and increasing quantities; that these products were hauled over the new road in motor trucks to De Queen and Locksburg, those taken to Locksburg being then forwarded over a short local railroad to De Queen; that all were there shipped over the railway-the one in question-to Kansas City and other points beyond; and that there was no other railway leading to available markets. The same witnesses further testified that the change from the old to the new uses was still progressing; that other lands tributary to the new road and not cultivated before were being prepared for cultivation; and that timber and other heavy products which could not reach the railway before were being hauled over the new road and shipped out in substantial volume.\n On the question of discrimination the evidence was meager. The assessed value of the railway property for general taxing purposes was conceded to be about one-half its actual value. On the basis of assessed values, that property was assessed with a much lower proportion of the total benefits than the farm lands and town lots were, the proportional relation being that of 16 to 54. There was some \n\n[266 U.S. 379, 385]\n\u00a0\n evidence of instances in which the assessed value of farm lands and town lots for general taxing purposes was less than one-half their real value, but there was no evidence that this was general. Even in the instances named the benefits assessed were generally much in excess of 16 per cent. of one-half the real value. There was no evidence of an intentional overassessment of benefits to the railway property or of an intentional under-assessment to the farm lands and town lots. The three assessors testified that they assessed all property in the same way-according to the benefits which in their judgment the particular parcels would receive from the improvement of the road.\n The circuit court was of opinion on all the evidence that the improvement would bring to the railway a very substantial increase in tonnage and business at De Queen; that this would enlarge its receipts and net revenue, and thereby materially benefit its property at De Queen; and that the assessment of benefits to that property was neither arbitrary nor unreasonably discriminatory, but just and fair. On that determination of the issues of fact the court entered a judgment overruling the objections and upholding the assessment. The companies appealed to the Supreme Court of the state, and it affirmed the judgment. 156 Ark. 116, 246 S. W. 113. That court put its decision on two grounds taken collectively-one that the special confirmatory act constituted a legislative determination of the correctness of the assessment, which could not be overturned unless found to be obviously arbitrary or unreasonably discriminatory; and the other that there was ample evidence to sustain the findings of the circuit court, which negatived the existence of any such error, and that the circuit court's solution of the conflicts in the evidence was not open to review on appeal.\n The companies brought the case here on writ of error, and afterwards presented a petition for certiorari, consideration \n\n[266 U.S. 379, 386]\n\u00a0\n of which was passed to the hearing on the writ of error. As the constitutional validity of the special confirmatory act was directly challenged in the state courts, and sustained by them, the case is properly here on the writ of error; so the petition for certiorari will be denied.\n The objection based on the commerce clause of the Constitution has been abandoned, but those based on the due process of law and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment are pressed on our attention.\n By a long line of decisions in this court it has been settled that, where the state Constitution as construed by the state court of last resort does not provide otherwise, the Legislature of a state may require that the cost of a local public improvement, such as the construction or reconstruction of a public road, be distributed over the lands particularly benefited and charged against them according to their value, their area, or the benefits which they will receive; may itself determine what lands will be benefited, and in what proportions they will share in the benefits; and may avail itself, for the purposes of that determination, of any information which it deems appropriate and sufficient, including such as may be afforded by reports and estimates made in prior assessment proceedings having the same object. Only where the legislative determination is palpably arbitrary, and therefore a plain abuse of power, can it be said to offend the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Spencer v. Merchant, \n125 U.S. 345\n, 355-357, 8 S. Ct. 921; French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n181 U.S. 324\n, 338, et seq., 21 S. Ct. 625; Houck v.

And only where there is manifest and unreasonable discrimination in fixing the benefits which the several parcels will receive can the legislative determination be said to contravene \n\n[266 U.S. 379, 387]\n\u00a0\n the equal protection clause of that amendment. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Road Improvement District No. 6, \n256 \nU.S. 658\n, 41 S. Ct. 604; Thomas v. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., \n261 \nU.S. 481\n, 43 S. Ct. 440.\n To justify an assessment of benefits to particular lands it is not essential that the benefits be direct or immediate. Valley Farms Co. v. Westchester County, supra. But it is essential that they have a better basis than mere speculation or conjecture. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Road Improvement District No. 3, supra. In the case of railway property they may consist of gains from increased traffic reasonably expected to result from the improvement. Thomas v. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., supra; Branson v. Bush, supra.\n The special confirmatory act was recognized by the Supreme Court of the state as a legislative determination of the lands which will be benefited and of the proportions in which they will share in the benefits. It therefore must be treated here as an admissible legislative assessment of benefits so far as the state Constitution is concerned.\n The evidence, as before outlined, falls short of showing that the assessment against the railway property was either palpably arbitrary or unreasonably discriminatory. The burden was on the railway companies to overcome the presumption attending the legislative determination, and this they failed to do; for, under the evidence produced, it is an entirely admissible view that the railway property will be substantially benefited by the road improvement and that the benefits are fairly assessed as between that property and the farm lands and town lots. True, the amount of benefits which will accrue to the railway property is largely a matter of forecast and estimate; but the same thing is true of the farm lands and town lots, and also of benefit assessments in general. See Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n197 \nU.S. 430, 433\n, 25 S. Ct. 466; Butters v. Oakland, \n263 U.S. 162\n, \n\n[266 U.S. 379, 388]\n\u00a0\n 165, 44 S. Ct. 62. Forecast and estimate, based on a solid premise of fact and experience, are not to be confused with mere speculation and conjecture.\n The road in question extends, at right angles to the railway line, a distance of 18 miles into a country well adapted to supplying large traffic for the railway when the improvement is completed. Adjacent to the road, as is conceded in the brief for the railway companies, are 1,587 tracts of farm lands of less than 80 acres and 246 tracts of a larger acreage. The only practicable route to available markets is through De Queen and over the railway. These facts, together with the affirmative evidence of what was undertaken and done in the way of growing new crops and shipping them out over the railway as soon as the improvement was well under way, illustrate that there was a real basis for assessing the railway property at De Queen with substantial benefits. Had the companies recognized this and devoted themselves to showing that the amount of benefits assessed to their property was excessive, instead of attempting to show that it would receive no benefits whatever, they possibly might have made a better case. But that course was not taken, and necessarily the state courts rested their decision on the evidence that was presented. That evidence fairly admitted of the view, taken in those courts, that the assessment was not excessive.\n The companies make a contention which may be summarized as follows: Assume that the improvement will bring to the railway, at De Queen, an increased tonnage and business yielding gross receipts amounting to $10, 000 a year. According to the evidence one-fourth of that sum, or $2,500, will be net revenue. This increase in net revenue must be spread over the entire railway, which is 800 miles long. The portion assignable to the two miles of main line within the road district is $6.25. This sum, capitalized on a 6 per cent. basis, which gives $104.16, \n\n[266 U.S. 379, 389]\n\u00a0\n represents the full benefit to the railway property within the district.\n The contention is faulty in several respects. The increased traffic will not be carried from one end of the railway to the other, but only from De Queen to Kansas City. The railway property within the district includes much more than the 2 miles of main track. Doubtless, the increased traffic will in a way benefit the railway as a whole; but the traffic will be appurtenant to the portion of the railway at De Queen, and will specially enhance the importance and value of the property there as a part of the line.\n Other contentions are advanced, which need not be specially noticed here, because they are shown to be quite untenable in the decisions before cited.\n We conclude that the objections made to the assessment on constitutional ground are not well taken.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKELLER v. ADAMS-CAMPBELL CO(1924)\nNo. 315\nArgued: Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 314, 315]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.\n Wm. A. Loftus and Charles E. Townsend, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n Mr. Ford W. Harris, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit to enjoin the infringement of a patent for an improvement in auxiliary windshields for automobiles. It was brought on a reissued patent. The reissue was granted on the ground that the original patent was inoperative to protect the real invention, due to defective and insufficient and too narrow claims, all of which arose through inadvertence and mistake, due to misunderstanding between the inventor and his solicitor. The defect in his claims was alleged to have been called to his attention April 1, 1919, his application for reissue was filed May 22, 1919, 6 months and 10 days after the granting of the original patent, and the patent for reissue was granted July 20, 1920\n\n\n A. F. Kipper, who was the cative person among the defendants in designing and promoting the manufacture of the windshield, charged to be an infringement, was familiar with the device, the specifications and claims of Keller. He conceived of his device in December of 1918, made some models of it in February of 1919, and in association with one Dick Smith got up some experimental dies and tools for its manufacture and sale in April and May of that year. Kipper was an employee of Adams-Campbell \n\n[264 U.S. 314, 316]\n\u00a0\n Company, and that firm in August of 1919 made a contract with Kipper to go into the business of making and selling his product.\n The suit for infringement was begun July 1, 1921. All the usual defenses were set up, including lack of invention, the invalidity of the reissue, and noninfringement. There was only one expert witness produced by the plaintiff as to the originality and utility of the invention and the infringement by the respondent's device. His evidence was presented in an affidavit, but he was tendered for cross-examination, which the defendants below declined to pursue. No expert evidence was offered by defendants, though they introduced a number of patents to show the state of the art.\n The patent is for glass wings or auxiliaries secured in an adjustable manner to the main windshield of an automobile. Their principal object is thoroughly to prevent the creation of a draft through the vehicle body, and they are so mounted that they will not obstruct vision, and will have a universality of movement on a double hinge, such that they can be changed from their normal position of preventing a draft in cold or windy weather to a deflected position permitting varying degrees of draft desirable in hot weather. To avoid the necessity of a frame around the glass, and to hold it safely and firmly and avoid danger to occupants of the car from breakage and flying pieces of glass, a hollow rod extends lengthwise along the shield, and connects with, and spaces apart, clamp brackets along each end of the shield. The rod is attached at its middle to a double hinge joint, giving the shield the universal movement already referred to, and having means firmly to lock it in any position. The real difference between the device as shown in the patent and the alleged infringement is in the method by which the glass is clamped. In the patent, the clamps operate on both sides of the ends of the glass, engaging its opposite surfaces. In the defendant's \n\n[264 U.S. 314, 317]\n\u00a0\n device, these clamps are brought nearer to the center of the shield member, because they are held by perforations in the glass and do not need to reach over to the ends.\n The District Court dismissed the bill, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this decree. We granted certiorari upon the allegation of the petition, not denied by opposing counsel, that the sole question was whether one who makes and sells articles not covered by the claims of an original patent, but embraced by the enlarged claims of a subsequent valid reissue, applied for within 7 months after the original was granted, has intervening rights such that he is not only immune from liability for what he has made and sold, but enjoys an irrevocable and permanent license to continue to make and sell without restriction.\n The extent of the operation of the estoppel creating intervening rights in such a case presents a question not free from difficulty. That a reissued patent enlarging claims of the original, although not specifically mentioned in section 4916, R. S. (Comp. St.  9461), is authorized by that section, when the failure to claim the larger claims justified by the actual invention was due to inadvertence, accident, or mistake, is settled by the decision of this court in Topliff v. Topliff, \n145 U.S. 156\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 825, and other cases. That case also recognizes that one who, pending the application and granting of the reissue, manufactures and sells articles which infringe the reissued patent, may be protected on principles of estoppel from the literal application of section 4916, R.S., which makes the operation of the reissue relate to the date of the original patent. In Abercrombie & Fitch Company v. Baldwin, \n245 U.S. 198\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 104, a change, in the reissue, of the language of an original claim made it cover, not only a bent pipe as shown, but a straight pipe as well, where the substance of the invention included both, and it was held that the intervening rights of immunity of the infringer did not extend \n\n[264 U.S. 314, 318]\n\u00a0\n beyond the date of the reissue. It is insisted, however, that the Fitch Case was not one of an enlarged claim, or at any rate that a reissue was unnecessary because the original claim would have sufficed. The views of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the general subject of the scope of intervening rights are not entirely easy to reconcile. Crown Cork & Seal Company v. Aluminum Stopper Company, 108 Fed. 845, 48C. C. A. 72; General Electric Company v. Railway Company, 178 Fed. 84, 102 C. C. A. 138; A. D. Howe Mach. Co. v. Coffield Motor Washer Co., 197 Fed. 541, 117 C. C. A. 37; Autopiano Company v. American Player Action Company, 222 Fed. 276, 138 C. C. A. 38; American Automotoneer Company v. Porter, 232 Fed. 456, 146 C. C. A. 450. The question, if it were really before us, would be one sufficiently important, therefore, to justify our consideration of it on certiorari.\n Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals, in their final disposition of the case, gave color of support to the claim of the petitioner that the question of intervening rights was in this case.\n The District Judge in dismissing the bill said:\n'Without further discussion, I think the defendants occupy the position of one who has intervening rights, and under those circumstances I think the plaintiffs are not entitled to a reissue of the patent as against the defendants.'\n\n So the Circuit Court of Appeals, after reciting the evidence showing that the defendants had made the shields in question and built the machinery for future manufacture before the patentee applied for reissue, and after being advised by counsel that they would not infringe the original patent, said:\n'We therefore think it clear that the appellees had and have such intervening rights as were properly protected by the court below.'\n\n Yet an analysis of the record and the reasons given in the body of the opinions of the two courts leads to a different conclusion. The District Court said of the alleged infringing device: \n\n[264 U.S. 314, 319]\n\u00a0\n 'The defendants' bracket is an invention. It is a surprise to me that that which the defendants did could be done. The bracket will fit any glass. It is shorter and does not obstruct the view. ... The defendants' bracket is not an equivalent of the bracket in plaintiffs' original patent, because it does not perform the same functions in the same way, but it performs the function of holding the glass in an entirely different way.'\n So the Circuit Court of Appeals said:\n'That there is nothing of a pioneer nature in Keller's device is abundantly shown by the numerous exhibits appearing in the record of windshields and deflectors, of one kind or another, attached to automobiles long before Keller entered the field. Both his drawings and specifications show that his shield is attached to the machine by brackets that run up and down the glass, holding it at the top and bottom, whereas the appellee's device holds the glass by means of a fixture attached to the face of the glass, and which does not extend to either of its ends.\n\n'That for one device to be the equivalent of another it is essential that the former must perform the same function of the latter in substantially the same way is thoroughly settled law.'\n\n These passages, read in connection with the original and reissued patents and the alleged infringement, show that what the courts really held was that the defendants were manufacturing a different invention from that of the plaintiffs, and so could not and did not infringe. Such an ordinary patent case, with the usual issues of invention, breadth of claims, and noninfringement, this court will not bring here by certiorari, unless it be necessary to reconcile decisions of Circuit Courts of Appeal on the same patent. We therefore find ourselves mistaken in assuming that an important issue of general patent law, under section 4916, R. S., is here involved. \n\n[264 U.S. 314, 320]\n\u00a0\n The result is that an order must be entered dismissing the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted, at the costs of the petitioner.

St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4137aa), make the possession of intoxicating liquor in the Indian country, as therein defined, a criminal offense. The \n\n[265 U.S. 344, 345]\n\u00a0\n plaintiffs in error were indicted and convicted of having whisky in their possession in the Indian country, in Osage county, Okl., on July 24, 1920, in violation of the acts above mentioned. The case was taken on writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit, and that court, under section 239 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1216), certified a question of law to this court. It is this:\n'Was that portion of the Act of July 23, 1892 (section 4136a, Comp. Stat.), as amended by the Act of January 30, 1897 (section 4137, Comp. Stat.), and by the Act of May 25, 1918 (section 4137aa, Comp. Stat.), which made possession of intoxicating liquor in the Indian country a criminal offense and fixed the punishment therefor, repealed, superseded, or modified by the enactment of the National Prohibition Act, 41 Statutes at Large, 305, 308, title 2, sections 3, 25, 29, 33, and 35?'\n\n The act of 1918 provides that 'possession by a person of intoxicating liquors in the Indian country where the introduction is or was prohibited by treaty or federal statute shall be an offense and punished in accordance with' the above-mentioned acts of 1892 and 1897. Mere possession is made criminal. The purpose of the possession or the intended use is not material. The particular place and its character, Indian country, are essential. The evils aimed at are those which result from liquor traffic in localities where Indians live or which they are liable to frequent. These statutes apply locally for the special purpose of keeping whisky and other intoxicants out of the reach of Indians.\n By the Eighteenth Amendment, the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors, in the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof, for beverage purposes is prohibited. The National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/4 et seq.) was passed to enforce that amendment. Liquor for nonbeverage purposes may be purchased, sold, and possessed as specified in that act, but not in violation \n\n[265 U.S. 344, 346]\n\u00a0\n of the legislation relating to the Indian country. See title 2,  3, 4, 6, 13, 25, 33, 37.\n The offense charged against plaintiffs in error is not the same as any defined in the National Prohibition Act. Those portions of the acts of 1892, 1897, and 1918, passed for the protection of the Indian country, mentioned in the certificate of the Circuit Court of Appeals, do not conflict with the National Prohibition Act. Both may stand.

DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION OF STATE OF LOUISIANA(1924)\nNo. 65\nArgued: October 11, 1923Decided: January 7, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 545, 546]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Morris B. Redmann and Edwin T. Merrick, both of New Orleans, La., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Paul A. Sompayrac, of New Orleans, La., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs in error are severally engaged in Louisiana in the business of buying, selling, importing, exporting and dealing in hides, skins and furs, some of which come from wild fur-bearing animals and alligators in that \n\n[263 U.S. 545, 547]\n\u00a0\n state. They brought this suit in the civil district court of the parish of Orleans to enjoin the defendant in error from enforcing the payment of a severance tax levied by Act 135 of the General Assembly of Louisiana, 1920. 1 By that act, all wild fur-bearing animals and alligators in the state, and their skins, are declared to be the property of the state untill the severance tax thereon shall have been paid. A dealer is defined to be one who buys such \n\n[263 U.S. 545, 548]\n\u00a0\n skins and hides from either a trapper or a buyer and ships them from the state, or sells them for manufacture into a finished product in the state, or one who ships or carries them out of the state. Section 3 levies a severance tax of 2 per cent. on the value of all skins and hides taken from wild fur-bearing animals or alligators within the state, to be paid by the dealer to the state through the department of conservation. By other sections, trappers, buyers and dealers are required to pay license fees and to furnish to the department information concerning their respective occupations; an open season is fixed in each year for the taking of fur-bearing animals and alligators respectively, and such taking is prohibited at other times.\n In their complaint, the plaintiffs in error aver that the defendant in error demands and purposes to enforce payment of the severance tax. They declare that they are willing to pay the license fee under protest and without conceding the validity of the act, but that defendant in error has refused to accept such payment or to issue licenses until the severance tax shall have been paid. It is set forth that the defendant in error has formulated rules and regulations requiring all shipments of such skins and hides to have attached thereto a certificate or label issued by the defendant in error, showing the payment of the severance tax, and prohibiting any carrier from accepting such shipments if not so labeled. It is alleged that defendant in error is about to seize and confiscate all shipments of skins and hides to be made by plaintiff in error, and that such seizure would be illegal and would constitute a taking of property without due process of law, and would inflict upon them irreparable injury and damages, leaving them without remedy therefor.\n Defendant in error moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that the complaint failed to state a cause of action, \n\n[263 U.S. 545, 549]\n\u00a0\n and the district court granted the motion. The case was taken on appeal to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, and that court denied all contentions of plaintiffs in error, including one that the act is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States and to the Fourteenth Amendment, and affirmed the judgment.\n The wild animals within its borders are, so far as capable of ownership, owned by the state in its sovereign capacity for the common benefit of all of its people. Because of such ownership, and in the exercise of its police power the state may regulate and control the taking, subsequent use and property rights that may be acquired therein. Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 \nU.S. 519, 528\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 600; Ward v. Race Horse, \n163 \nU.S. 504, 507\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 1076; Silz v. Hesterberg, \n211 \nU.S. 31, 39\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 10; Patsone v.

Rodman, 58 Minn. 393, 400, 59 N. W. 1098\n\n\n Whether the tax here involved might be upheld by virtue of the power of the state to prohibit, and therefore to condition, the removal of wild game from the state, we do not now consider; but dispose of the case upon other grounds. The commerce clause (article 1, section 8, clause 3) confers on Congress power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and therefore such power is impliedly forbidden to the states. 'Even their power to lay and collect taxes, comprehensive and necessary as that power is, cannot be exerted in a way which involves a discrimination against such commerce.' Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553, 596\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 658, and cases cited; Kansas City Railway v. Kansas, \n240 \nU.S. 227, 231\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 261; Brimmer v.

A state may not enforce any law, the necessary effect of which is to prevent, obstruct or burden interstate commerce. Pennsylvania \n\n[263 U.S. 545, 550]\n\u00a0\n v. West Virginia, supra, 596, 597, and cases cited. The Supreme Court of Louisiana held that the act here in question is a police regulation and not a revenue act; that its object is to conserve and protect all furbearing animals and alligators within its borders, including their skins and hides; that the various subdivisions of the act relate to that object, and that payment of the tax is a condition precedent to the divestiture of the state's title and its transfer to the dealer paying the tax. The court said, in substance, that the tax is necessarily levied upon dealers, as they have established places of business, make inventories, and are easily accessible for the purpose of collection, and pointed out the difficulties in the way of levying the charge, at the time of the severing of the skins or hides, on itinerant trappers with no fixed place of abode or business.\n This court will determine for itself what is the necessary operation and effect of a state law challenged on the ground that it interferes with or burdens interstate commerce. The name, description or characterization given it by the Legislature or the courts of the state will not necessarily control. Regard must be had to the substance of the measure rather than its form. Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 U.S. 178\n, 189, et seq.;2 Kansas City Railway v. Kansas, supra; St. Louis Southwestern Railway v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99; U. S. Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335, 346\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 211; Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 227\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 638. Our examination of this act discloses no reason why the decision of the state court should be disturbed. The legislation is a valid exertion of the police power of the state to conserve and protect wild life for the common benefit. It is within the power of the state to impose the exaction as a condition precedent to the divestiture of its title and to the acquisition of private ownership. Expressly, the tax is imposed upon all skins and hides taken within the \n\n[263 U.S. 545, 551]\n\u00a0\n state. This includes those, if any, sold for manufacture in the state as well as those shipped out. In their argument here, plaintiffs in error stated that skins and hides are not manufactured into finished products in Louisiana, and that all are shipped out of the state. But that is no objection to the tax. The state's power to tax property is not destroyed by the fact that it is intended for and will move in interstate commerce. Such skins and hides may be taxed while in the hands of dealers before they move in interstate commerce. Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517, 525\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 475; Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 \nU.S. 504, 515\n, 516 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 299; Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 151\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 237. Failure to levy and enforce the tax before the skins and hides reach the dealers does not make the necessary operation and effect of the law an interference with interstate commerce. The imposition of the tax on the skins and hides while in the hands of the dealers is calculated to make certain that all will be found for taxation. No interference with interstate commerce results from the enforcement of the act. It is not repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n Plaintiffs in error contend that the act violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. They argue that legislative authority is improperly delegated to, and that arbitrary power is conferred upon, the department of conservation, and that the severance tax is bad because imposed on such dealers in addition to property and license taxes that are imposed on merchants generally.\n The contentions are without merit. The act provides:\n'That there be and is hereby levied a severance tax of two (2c) cents on the dollar on and of the value of all skins or hides taken from any wild fur-bearing animals or alligators within this state, which severance tax shall be paid by the dealer ... under such rules and regulations as shall be determined by the department of con- \n\n[263 U.S. 545, 552]\n\u00a0\n servation....' That department is authorized to ascertain purchase prices of skins and hides paid by the dealer, to determine the time when and the manner in which the tax shall be paid, and to adopt and enforce rules and regulations not contrary to the act in relation to the collection of the tax. It is not shown that defendant in error has made, or proposes to apply, any unreasonable, capricious or arbitrary rules, regulations or methods of valuation for the purpose of arriving at the amount of the tax or for enforcing its payment. The Fourteenth Amendment does not require equality of taxation within the state or prevent the laying of special or additional taxes upon defined classes of property, so long as the inequality is not based upon arbitrary distinctions. It does not prohibit state legislation imposing a severance tax upon such skins and hides, even if no similar or corresponding tax is levied upon other property of merchants.

Protection of the wild life of the state is peculiarly within the police power, and the state has great latitude in determining what means are appropriate for its protection.\n\n The act is not repugnant to the due process or equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The scope and substance of the act is indicated by its title which is as follows:\n'An Act\n\n'Declaring the wild fur-bearing animals and alligators of this state to be the property of the state, and the skins taken from such animals to be the property of the state until there shall have been paid to the state of Louisiana, through the department of conservation, the severance tax levied thereon by the provisions of this act; levying an annual license tax on persons, firms, corporations or associations of persons engaged in the buying of hides and skins taken from wild fur-bearing animals and alligators, and prohibiting the conduct of such business without such license; levying a severance tax of two (2c) cents on the dollar of and on the value of the hides and skins taken from the wild fur-bearing animals and alligators of this state, fixing the time when, by whom, and under that conditions such severance tax shall be paid; defining the time and making an open season for the trapping of all fur-bearing animals and the taking and killing of alligators in this state; to allow licensed trappers to hunt wild game without additional license; to prohibit persons, firms, corporations, or associations from shipping or selling hides or skins taken from wild fur-bearing animals or alligators of this state unless said severance tax is paid thereon; requiring all persons dealing in hides and skins taken from wild fur-bearing animals and alligators of this state to keep record of all receipts and sales of said hides and skins and to make reports of same to the department of conservation; to define trappers, fur dealers, fur buyers, resident and nonresident; to authorize the department of conservation to adopt rules and regulations providing for the collecting of the severance tax and licenses herein imposed and regulating the handling and disposition of all hides and skins of fur- bearing animals and alligators; to provide penalties for the violation of this act and to repeal all conflicting laws.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 38 Sup.

Johnston, of Roanoke, Va., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Harvey B. Apperson, of Salem, Va., and James A. Bear and G. A. Wingfield, both of Roanoke, Va., for respondent. \n\n[265 U.S. 365, 366]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case, which arises in proceedings in bankruptcy, involves claims by a judgment creditor to liens upon the real estate of the bankrupts.\n On July 20, 1920, the Liberty National Bank recovered a judgment in a Virginia court against the Roanoke Provision Co., a partnership composed of the two Beckers, and against the Beckers individually. This judgment- which was duly docketed in the Judgment Lien Book and on which execution was issued-was under the laws of Virginia a lien upon the real estate of the judgment debtors. Code of 1919,  6470\n\n\n Thereafter, on August 6, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed in the Federal District Court against the Company, as a partnership composed of the two Beckers, alleging that it had committed an act of bankruptcy on August 4 by executing a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, and that it was insolvent. There was no allegation that the Beckers were individually insolvent or had committed acts of bankruptcy; and no prayer that they be adjudged bankrupt individually. They filed a joint answer admitting the allegations of the petition. On August 20, the Company, as a partnership composed of the two Beckers, was adjudged bankrupt by the District Judge; but they were not adjudged bankrupt ad individuals. Thereafter, pursuant to an order of the referee, the Company and the Beckers filed schedules of their respective assets and liabilities.\n In April, 1921-more than nine months after the recovery of the judgment-the Beckers filed separate voluntary petitions in bankruptcy; and each was adjudged bankrupt as an individual. Bear, the trustee in the partnership proceeding, was appointed trustee of their individual estates. \n\n[265 U.S. 365, 367]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter the Bank filed proofs of claim on its judgment against the separate estates of the Beckers, alleging that it constituted a lien upon their individual real estate and was entitled to priority as such. The trustee filed objections to the allowance of these prior claims, on the ground, among others, that by virtue of the proceedings against the Company he had been vested with title to the property of the individual partners as well as that of the partnership, as of the date of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy against the partnership, and that as the judgment against the individual partners had been recovered within four months prior to the filing of that petition, it could not, under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9585-9656), be enforced as a lien upon their separate estates. He did not aver, however, that either the Company or the Beckers were insolvent at the time the judgment was recovered.\n The referee, holding that the liens created by the judgment upon the separate properties of the Beckers had been 'annulled' by the proceedings under the petition against the partnership, disallowed the claims of the Bank, as secured claims and allowed them as unsecured claims merely. \n1\n This order of the referee was reversed by the District Judge, on the ground that as the order of adjudication had merely adjudged the bankruptcy of the Company, and not the bankruptcy of the Beckers individually, the lien of the judgment upon their separate estates had not been 'nullified.' The trustee was thereupon granted an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The Bank moved to dismiss this appeal upon the ground, among others, that the trustee had not alleged, either in his objections to the allowance of its claims or elsewhere, that the Beckers were insolvent at the time the judgment was \n\n[265 U.S. 365, 368]\n\u00a0\n recovered, nor had such insolvency been proven; and that allegation and proof of their insolvency at the time the lien of the judgment attached was 'absolutely essential.' The Circuit Court of Appeals-without ruling on this motion-reversed the decree of the District Court upon the ground that the 'adjudication of the partnership was necessarily an adjudication of the bankruptcy of the individuals composing it, and that ... the lien of a judgment obtained within four months of the filing of the petition against the partnership was lost by the adjudication.' 285 Fed. 703. This decision was apparently based upon Section 67f of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9651)-upon which the trustee had relied at the hearing before the referee2-although no reference to it is made in the opinion; it being evidently assumed by the court that under that section a judgment lien obtained within four months prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy is dissolved by the subsequent adjudication of the bankruptcy of the judgment debtor, without reference to his solvency or insolvency at the time the lien was obtained. \n3\n This writ of certiorari was then granted. \n261 U.S. 612\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 434.\n Upon the question whether the adjudication of the bankruptcy of a partnership involves an adjudication of the bankruptcy of the individual partners, there appears to have been a diversity of opinion in the lower federal courts. The decision in Francis v. McNeal, \n228 U.S. 695\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 701, L. R. A. 1915E, 706, upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals chiefly relied, did not involve a determination of this direct question. And we do not find it necessary to determine it now; since, even if the adjudication of the bankruptcy \n\n[265 U.S. 365, 369]\n\u00a0\n of the Company operated as an adjudication of the bankruptcy of the Beckers individually-which we do not intimate-nevertheless, in the absence of either pleading or proof as to their insolvency when the Bank recovered its judgment, there is no ground under Section 67f of the Act for annulling the lien thereby acquired upon their property. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n This section provides:\n'That all levies, judgments, attachments, or other liens, obtained through legal proceedings against a person who is insolvent, at any time within four months prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him, shall be deemed null and void in case he is adjudged a bankrupt, and the property affected by the levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien shall be deemed wholly discharged and released from the same, and shall pass to the trustee as a part of the estate of the bankrupt. ...'\n\n It applies only to liens obtained in legal proceedings against a person who was 'insolvent' when the lien was acquired. If the debtor was then solvent the lien is not invalidated although it was obtained within four months prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. Taubel- Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, \n264 U.S. 426\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 396, 68 L. Ed. --. To invalidate the lien the person challenging it must show that the debtor was insolvent when it was obtained. Stone-Ordean-Wells Co. v. Mark, 227 Fed. 975, 978, 142 C. C. A. 433; Martin v. Oliver, 260 Fed. 89, 93, 171 C. C. A. 125; Simpson v. Van Etten (C. C.) 108 Fed. 199, 201; Keystone Brew'g Co. v.

Such \n\n[265 U.S. 365, 370]\n\u00a0\n insolvency must be both alleged and proved. Stone-Ordean-Wells Co. v. Mark, supra, page 978.\n In the present case the trustee neither alleged the insolvency of the Beckers at the time the judgment was recovered and became a lien on their properties, nor proved such insolvency. If the admission in their joint answer to the petition filed against the partnership that the Company was insolvent, was intended as an admission of their individual insolvency, it was, at the most, an admission of such insolvency on August 6, when the petition in bankruptcy was filed5-a very different thing from insolvency at the time the judgment was recovered-and, in any event, would not have been binding on the Bank, which was not then a party to the bankruptcy proceeding. So, if the adjudication of the partnership as a bankrupt can be regarded as adjudging the insolvency of the individual partners at the date the petition in bankruptcy was filed-which we do not determine-such an adjudication, for like reason, would not be binding upon the Bank. Gratiot State Bank v. Johnson, \n249 U.S. 246\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 263. And, generally, an adjudication in bankruptcy in no way determines whether or not the debtor was insolvent at the time a lien was obtained through legal proceedings against him; there being no presumption arising from the adjudication that he was insolvent for any period before the petition in bankruptcy was filed. Keystone Brew'g Co. v. Schermer, supra, page 365, 88 Atl. 657; Jackson v. Valley Tie Co., supra, page 719, 62 S. E. 964; Newberry Shoe Co. v. Collier, supra, page 291, 68 S. E. 974. Nor does the fact that the sales of the partnership and individual properties made some months later by the trustee did \n\n[265 U.S. 365, 371]\n\u00a0\n not realize enough to pay either the debts of the partnership or the debts of the individual partners, respectively, establish the insolvency of the partners at the time the lien was obtained.\n There being neither allegation nor proof by the trustee of the insolvency of the Beckers when the Bank recovered its judgment and fastened its liens upon their real estate, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The referee at the same time disallowed another claim of the Bank to a lien upon the real estate of the partnership; but no steps were taken by the Bank to review his order in this respect. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This appears from a statement in the opinion of the referee. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Court said: 'The insolvency of the partnership at the date of the judgment seems to have been assumed in the court below. At any rate, no issue of solvency or insolvency at the date of the judgment appears to have been made. We express no opinion as to the existence of such insolvency or its effect.' Page 706. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] There is neither averment nor proof bringing the case within section 67c or any other provision of the act relating to the annulment of prior liens. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The act of bankruptcy alleged, namely, the making of a general assignment on August 4, did not involve a question of the insolvency of the partnership at that date; the making of a general assignment being an act of bankruptcy without reference to the solvency or insolvency of the debtor.

The allegations are sufficient to bring the controversy within the court's jurisdiction and empowered it to determine questions of both state and federal law. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban Railroad Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88. A special court of three judges (Judicial Code,  266 [Comp. St.  1243]) heard the issues, held the commission lacked power to make the order, and directed an interlocutory injunction. See 287 Fed. 390. The cause is here by direct appeal.\n In 1878 the appellee railroad company acquired title to certain land now in New Orleans, fronting 375 feet on the Mississippi river and extending back 4,000 feet, and for 40 years has held it under fence. Twenty tracks laid thereon are in constant use. During 1904 the city offered to sell the right to operate a street railway over this property, subject to part payment of the cost of constructing and the entire cost of maintaining the essential viaduct, which the city agreed to provide. This franchise was duly adjudicated, and in 1905 appellee, by definite contract, granted to the city the right to construct the present viaduct over its property at Newton street, upon the express condition that the grantee should pay for both erection and subsequent maintenance. Under this contract, and not otherwise, without expropriation of the right of way by the public or compensation to the land owner, \n\n[264 U.S. 393, 396]\n\u00a0\n the structure was erected. It is 2,000 feet long and extends several hundred feet on either side of appellee's land. For many years the street railway operated over its entire length. Finally, the portion over appellee's tracks fell into disrepair, and both city and street railway company failed to restore it. Finding this situation, appellant issued the order copied above.\n Article 6, Louisiana Constitution of 1921, provides:\n'Sec. 4. The commission shall have and exercise all necessary power and authority to supervise, govern, regulate and control all common carrier railroads, street railroads ... and other public utilities in the state of Louisiana, and to fix reasonable and just single and joint line rates, fares, tolls or charges for the commodities furnished, or services rendered by such common carriers or public utilities, except as herein otherwise provided. The power, authority and duties of the commission shall affect and include all matters and things connected with, concerning, and growing out of the service to be given or rendered by the common carriers and public utilities hereby, or which may hereafter be made subject to supervision, regulation and control by the commission. ...\n\n'Sec. 9. Until otherwise provided by the Legislature, all laws enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Louisiana since the adoption of the Constitution of 1898, and in effect at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, affecting, concerning, or relating to the Railroad Commission of Louisiana, not inconsistent with any of the provisions hereof, shall be construed as referring and applying to the Louisiana Public Service Commission, and nothing in this Constitution shall be construed as in any manner impairing or affecting such laws.'\n\n The commission claims that the power which it undertook to exercise is conferred by these sections and that the Supreme Court of the state so held in Gulf, C. & S. F. \n\n[264 U.S. 393, 397]\n\u00a0\n Ry. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission, 151 La. 635, 92 South. 143.\n The court below entertained another view of the constitutional grant and of the opinion relied upon. We think the conclusion which it reached is correct, and its decree must be affirmed.\n Article 284, Louisiana Constitutions of 1898 and 1913:\n'The power and authority is hereby vested in the commission [Railroad, Express, Telephone, Telegraph, Steamboat and other Water Craft, and Sleeping Car Commission, created by Article 283], and it is hereby made its duty, to adopt, change or make reasonable and just rates, charges and regulations, to govern and regulate railroad, steamboat and other water craft, and sleeping car, freight and passenger tariffs and service, express rates, and telephone and telegraph charges, to correct abuses, and prevent unjust discrimination and extortion in the rates for the same, on the different railroads, steamboat and other water craft, sleeping car, express, telephone and telegraph lines of this state, and to prevent such companies from charging any greater compensation in the aggregate for the like kind of property or passengers, or messages, for a shorter than a longer distance over the same line, unless authorized by the commission to do so in special cases; to require all railroads to build and maintain suitable depots, switches and appurtenances, wherever the same are reasonably necessary at stations, and to inspect railroads and to require them to keep their tracks and bridges in a safe condition, and to fix and adjust rates between branch or short lines and the great trunk lines with which they connect, and to enforce the same by having the penalties hereby prescribed inflicted through the proper courts having jurisdiction. ...'\n\n By Act 132 of 1918 the General Assembly of Louisiana directed:\n'That the powers and duties of the Railroad \n\n[264 U.S. 393, 398]\n\u00a0\n Commission of Louisiana are hereby added to and enlarged; and the power and authority is hereby vested in the said commission, and it is hereby made its duty to require the owner, possessor or operator of any railway, railroad, tram road, log road, transportation, irrigation or drainage canal, or syphon, crossing any public road already constructed or which may hereafter be constructed, to construct and maintain a suitable and convenient crossing over such public road, the said crossing to extend to the limits of the right of way, or fifty feet from the center of such railway, railroad, tram road, log road, transportation, irrigation or drainage canal or syphon, in accordance with the standard specifications furnished by the state highway department of the board of state engineers in respect to such crossings.'\n\n The act further empowered the Railroad Commission to require such crossings upon proper certificates of the police juries in the respective parishes.\n The broad language of section 284, Constitutions of 1898 and 1913, was not regarded as sufficient to empower the Railroad Commission to require carriers to construct public crossings over their lines. To meet this situation and provide relief in the parishes the act of 1918 was passed; and it was an order issued under this act which the Supreme Court sustained in Gulf, C. & S. F. Ry. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission.\n Article 14,  22, Louisiana Constitution of 1921:\n'The electors of the city of New Orleans and of any political corporation which may be established within the territory now, or which may hereafter be embraced within the corporate limits of said city, shall have the right to choose their public officers. This section shall not prohibit ... nor shall it be construed as restricting the police power of the state, or as prohibiting the Legislature from appointing, or authorizing the appointment of, any board or commission with full authority \n\n[264 U.S. 393, 399]\n\u00a0\n in the city of New Orleans other than that of controlling the ordinary governmental functions of municipal government.'\n\n Unless and until otherwise advised by the Supreme Court of Louisiana, we must conclude that the general control of its own streets is an ordinary governmental function of the city of New Orleans.\n It would require more definite language than we find in the Constitution of 1921, or in Gulf, C. & S. F. Ry. v. Public Service Commission, to convince us that the commission has power to assume control over all those streets within New Orleans which approach or cross railroad tracks, and to disregard the solemn contracts of the municipality with respect thereto. That the liability which the commission has undertaken to impose upon appellee conflicts with the contract under which the latter granted permission to construct the viaduct over its property, is not denied. Only very clear and definite words would suffice to show that the state had undertaken to authorize a thing so manifestly unjust and oppressive.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N.R. CO. v. CENTRAL IRON & COAL CO.(1924)\nNo. 198\nArgued: February 19, 1924Decided: May 5, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 59, 60]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer W. Davis, of Chicago, Ill., and Alexander Britton, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 59, 63]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry A. Jones, of Washington, Pa., and Allan C. Rearick and Albert Chester Travis, both of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In January, 1917, the Central Iron & Coal Company sold Tutwiler & Brooks ten carloads of coke to be delivered \n\n[265 U.S. 59, 64]\n\u00a0\n f. o. b. cars at the seller's plant in Holt, Ala. Before delivery by the seller, the purchasers sold the coke to the Great Western Smelters Corporation of Mayer, Ariz. Thereafter, under instructions from Tutwiler & Brooks, and upon their agreement to pay the freight, the Central Company delivered, at its plant, the cars of coke to the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, directed shipment thereof to Mayer over that railroad and connecting lines, and took bills of lading which it delivered immediately to Tutwiler & Brooks. That firm made a draft for the purchase price on the Smelters Corporation, with bills of lading attached. The corporation paid the draft, received the bills of lading, and, upon surrendering them to the delivering carrier and payment to it of the freight demanded, obtained possession of the coke. The amount of the freight then demanded and paid was $5,082.15. The freight legally payable, according to the tariff, was $ 8,545.61.\n The undercharge as apparently not discovered until January, 1920. The Louisville & Nashville then made demand upon the Central Company for the amount ($3,463.46). Payment being refused, this action to recover it was brought in the federal court for the Northern District of Alabama, Western Division. Each party requested a directed verdict. It was directed for the defendant, judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (284 Fed. 250), and the case is here on writ of error under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218). Most of the facts were agreed. The bills of lading acknowledged receipt of the coke from the Central Company, stated that the coke was 'consigned to order of Tutwiler & Brooks, destination Mayer, Arizona, ... notify Great Western Smelters Corporation,' and provided, among other so-called conditions, that 'the owner or consignee shall pay the freight, and average, if any, ... and, if required, shall pay the same before \n\n[265 U.S. 59, 65]\n\u00a0\n delivery.' \n1\n There was no suggestion that Tutwiler & Brooks were insolvent. Whether collection could then have been made from the Smelters Corporation is a matter as to which there was conflicting evidence. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The shipment being an interstate one, the freight rate was that stated in the tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The amount of the freight charges legally payable was determined by applying this tariff rate to the actual weight. Thus they were fixed by law. No contract of the carrier could reduce the amount legally payable, or release from liability a shipper who had assumed an obligation to pay the charges. Nor could any act or omission of the carrier (except the running of the statute of limitations) estop or preclude it from enforcing payment of the full amount by a person liable therefor. Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Fink, \n250 U.S. 577\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 27; New York Central, etc., R. R. Co. v. York & Whitney Co., \n256 U.S. 406\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 509. Compare St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Spring River Stone Co., \n236 U.S. 718\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 456. But delivery of goods to a carrier for shipment does not, under the Interstate Commerce \n\n[265 U.S. 59, 66]\n\u00a0\n Act (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.), impose upon a shipper an absolute obligation to pay the freight charges. \n3\n The tariff did not provide when or by whom the payment should be made. As to these matters carrier and shipper were left free to contract, subject to the rule which prohibits discrimination. \n4\n The carrier was at liberty to require prepayment of freight charges, or to permit that payment to be deferred until the goods reached the end of the transportation. Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v. Georgia, \n235 \nU.S. 651, 656\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 214. Where payment is so deferred, the carrier may require that it be made before delivery of the goods, or concurrently with the delivery, or may permit it to be made later. Where the payment is deferred, the contract may provide that the shipper agrees absolutely to pay the charges, or it may provide merely that he shall pay if the \n\n[265 U.S. 59, 67]\n\u00a0\n consignee does not pay the charges demanded upon delivery of the goods, or the carrier may accept the goods for shipment solely on account of the consignee, and, knowing that the shipper is acting merely as agent for the consignee, may contract that only the latter shall be liable for the freight charges, or both the shipper and the consignee may be made liable. Nor does delivery of goods to a carrier necessarily import, under the general law, an absolute promise by the shipper to pay the freight charges. We must, therefore, determine what promise, if any, to pay freight charges was, in fact, made by the Central Company.\n To ascertain what contract was entered into we look primarily to the bills of lading, bearing in mind that the instrument serves both as a receipt and as a contract. \n5\n Ordinarily, the person from whom the goods are received for shipment assumes the obligation to pay the freight charges, and his obligation is ordinarily a primary one. This is true, even where the bill of lading contains, as here, a provision imposing liability upon the consignee; for the shipper is presumably the consignor, the transportation ordered by him is presumably on his own behalf, and a promise by him to pay therefor is inferred (that is, implied in fact), as a promise to pay for goods is implied, when one orders them from a dealer. But this inference may be rebutted, as in the case of other contracts. It may be shown, by the bill of lading or otherwise, that the shipper of the goods was not acting on his own behalf; that this fact was known by the carrier; that the parties intended not only that the consignee should assume an obligation to pay the freight charges, but that the shipper should not assume any liability whatsoever \n\n[265 U.S. 59, 68]\n\u00a0\n therefor;6 or that he should assume only a secondary liability. In this case, the bills of lading acknowledge receipt of the coke from the Central Company. But it did not sign them. Nor was it described therein as the consignor. There was no clause by which the shipper agrees expressly either to pay the freight charges or to guarantee their payment. The goods received were not declared to be deliverable to the Central Company's order. On the contrary, the form of the bills of lading indicated that it was neither the owner nor the person on whose behalf the shipment was being made, and that Tutwiler & Brooks were either the owners or the persons in whose behalf the shipment was being made. On these facts, the trial court was justified in finding that the Central Company did not assume the primary obligation to pay the freight charges. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[265 U.S. 59, 69]\n\u00a0\n It is urged that, if the Central Company was not under a primary obligation to pay the freight charges, it was secondarily liable, because collection from the Smelters Corporation of the balance remaining due had become impossible before the undercharge was discovered. But the trial judge was not compelled so to find. There was evidence that such collection had not become impossible. Confessedly no effort was made to collect from it. Nor was any effort made to collect from Tutwiler & Brooks. Moreover, if a secondary obligation of the Central Company was to be implied from the fact of its causing the \n\n[265 U.S. 59, 70]\n\u00a0\n coke to be received for transportation, the promise was not necessarily one to pay at any time any freight charges which the carrier might find it impossible to collect from the consignee or his assign. The court might have concluded that it guaranteed merely that the consignee or his assign would accept the shipment. For, under the rule of the Fink Case, if a shipment is accepted, the consignee becomes liable, as a matter of law, for the full amount of the freight charges, whether they are demanded at the time of delivery, or not until later. His liability satisfies the requirements of the Interstate Commerce Act\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The bills of lading also contained these clauses: 'If charges are to be prepaid, write or stamp here. Received $_____ to apply in prepayment of _____. To be prepaid, _____.' The blanks were not filled by writing or stamp. The form of bills of lading used was what is known as the standard form order bill of lading. But the goods shipped were made deliverable to the order of a named consignee. Compare Pere Marquette Ry. Co. v. French & Co., \n254 \nU.S. 538, 539\n, 540 S., 41 Sup. Ct, 195. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The corporation was not then technically insolvent; that is, no proceeding in bankruptcy had been instituted by or against it, there was no outstanding unsatisfied execution, and the corporation was still in possession of some unencumbered property. If the error had been discovered within a few months after delivery of the coke, the delivering carrier might easily have obtained payment of the amount of the undercharge by applying to that purpose funds of the Smelters Corporation then on deposit with it. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Interstate Commerce Commission Conference Ruling No. 314, Bulletin No. 7, issued August 1, 1917: 'The law requires the carrier to collect and the party legally responsible to pay the lawfully established rates without deviation therefrom. It follows that it is the duty of carriers to exhaust their legal remedies in order to collect undercharges from the party or parties legally responsible therefor. It is not for the Commission, however, to determine in any case which party, consignor or consignee, is legally liable for the undercharge, that being a question determinable only by a court having jurisdiction and upon the facts of each case.' This ruling, which was adopted May 1, 1911, and 'interpreted' May 4, 1918, was amended, on March 6, 1922, by calling attention to the provision inserted in the Uniform Domestic Bill of Lading prescribed October 21, 1921. By that provision the consignor may (see section 7 of conditions and clause on face of bill) relieve himself of all liability for freight charges. In the Matter of Bills of Lading, 52 Interst. Com.

GRIFFITH(1924)\nNo. 12\nArgued: October 6, 1924Decided: October 20, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 32, 33]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. D. Evans, of Waco, Tex., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity alleging that the plaintiffs are qualified electors residing in Houston, Texas, and of the Democratic political faith; that on January 27, 1921, the City Democratic Executive Committee of Houston made and published a rule that negroes would not be allowed to vote in the Democratic City Primary Election to be held on February 9, 1921; that the Committee and Judges of Election threatened to enforce the rule, contrary to the Constitution of the United States; and praying an injunction to restrain the Committee and Judges of Election from carrying out their threats. The bill was filed on February 3, 1921. On February 5, 1921, it was demurred to generally, the demurrer maintaining that the rule did not infringe the Fifteenth Amendment. On February 7, 1921, the demurrer was sustained and the bill was dismissed with costs. The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals, but that Court held that at the date of its decision, months after the election, the cause of action had ceased to exist and that the appeal would not be entertained on the question of costs alone. It therefore dismissed the appeal with costs. Error is assigned here on the ground that the Fifteenth Amendment prohibits the discrimination which was made the basis of the complaint, and that the decision denied the plaintiffs their constitutional rights.\n When as here there is a plain assertion of federal rights in the lower court, local rules as to how far it shall be reviewed on appeal do not necessarily prevail. Davis v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22, 24\n, 44 S. Ct. 13. Whether the right was denied or not given due recognition by the Court of Civil Appeals \n\n[266 U.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n is a question as to which the plaintiffs are entitled to invoke our judgment. Ward v. Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 22\n, 40 S. Ct. 419. If the case stood here as it stood before the court of first instance it would present a grave question of constitutional law and we should be astute to avoid hindrances in the way of taking it up. But that is not the situation. The rule promulgated by the Democratic Executive Committee was for a single election only that had taken place long before the decision of the Appellate Court. No constitutional rights of the plaintiffs in error were infringed by holding that the cause of action had ceased to exist. The bill was for an injunction that could not be granted at that time. There was no constitutional obligation to extend the remedy beyond what was prayed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLUCKING v.

Armstrong, Jr., both of Detroit, Mich., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n March 25, 1921, appellant filed his complaint in the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, praying a mandatory injunction to compel appellee to operate its steamboats, Alpena II and Mackinac II, on the Detroit and Mackinac route in the navigation season of that year, as it had done in prior years.\n Appellee is a corporation organized under the laws of Michigan, and has long been a common carrier of passengers and freight for hire on steamboats operated by it between Detroit, Mich., and Cleveland, Ohio, between Detroit and Buffalo, N. Y., and between Detroit and Mackinac Island, Mich. For many years, by arrangement with carriers by rail, it had carried some passengers and freight under joint lake and rail tariffs providing for continuous carriage, partly by railroad and partly by \n\n[265 U.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n water, to and from various ports reached by its steamers, and to and from points on lines of carriers by railroad. Appellee proposed to discontinue service on the route between Detroit and Mackinac Island. The complaint alleged that appellant had been in the past, and that he desired to become, in the season of 1921 and thereafter, a passenger and a shipper of freight on appellee's steamers on the Detroit and Mackinac route. It further alleged that it was appellee's duty to provide and furnish transportation for passengers and property during that season and thereafter over the route above named, and that to abandon such service would violate the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563), and particularly subdivisions (1)(a), (3), and (4) of section 1. Appellee moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction, and that appellant was not entitled to the relief prayed. The District Court held that the suit involved a federal question and was within its jurisdiction, and, on the merits, decided that appellant was not entitled to relief and dismissed the complaint. 273 Fed. 577. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 284 Fed. 497. The case is here on appeal under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218).\n On the allegations of the complaint, the suit is one arising under the laws of the United States, and particularly the Act to Regulate Commerce. Its decision involves the construction and application of certain provisions of that act. It was rightly held in the courts below that the District Court had jurisdiction. Louisville & Nashville R.

The company was organized \n\n[265 U.S. 346, 350]\n\u00a0\n under the Commerce and Navigation Act of 1867 (chapter 181, Compiled Laws 1897). By compliance with the provisions of that act, persons were authorized to become a body corporate 'for the purpose of engaging in the business of maritime commerce or navigation within this state, or upon the frontier lakes or other navigable waters, natural or artificial, connected therewith. ...' Section 2 The General Corporation Act of Michigan of 1903 (Complied Laws 1915, c. 175), superseded the act of 1867, but contained a saving clause as to rights which had been secured under the earlier act. The act under which appellee was organized does not prescribe or require the articles to specify any route over which such a corporation is to operate its boats, and does not require it to continue in business. Appellee's articles of association adopted the statutory language, and do not designate any route for the operation of its boats, or require it to continue operation. Appellee has no power of eminent domain or special privilege or right in respect of the business it is authorized to do, which a natural person owning a vessel and engaged in the same business does not have. It is under no contractual obligation to operate on the route in question. Act No. 56, Public Acts 1919, provides that no person, firm or corporation owning or operating any railroad shall abandon its main line or track or any portion thereof without the permission of the state commission. There is no similar statute relating to carriers by water.\n The obligation to continue is not imposed by any principle of the common law. Reasonableness of service on a route over which appellee operates boats is not involved. The duty to furnish reasonable service while engaged in business as a common carrier is to be distinguished from the obligation to continue in business. No case has been cited by counsel, and we know of none, in which it has been held that there is any common law duty \n\n[265 U.S. 346, 351]\n\u00a0\n on a common carrier by water not to cease to operate its boats. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The obligation to continue service is not imposed by any federal statute. Appellant relies on section 1, subd. (1)(a), of the Interstate Commerce Act (as amended by section 400, Transportation Act 1920 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563]), which provides that the act shall apply to common carriers engaged in the transportation of passengers or property wholly by railroad, or partly by railroad and partly by water, when both are used under a common control, management, or arrangement for continuous carriage or shipment, and a provision in subdivision (3) defining 'carrier' to mean 'common carrier,' and 'transportation' to include locomotives, cars and other vehicles, vessels, and all instrumentalities of shipment or carriage, and a provision of subdivision (4) making it the duty of every common carrier, subject to the act, engaged in the transportation of passengers or property, to provide and furnish such transportation upon reasonable request therefor.\n But in connection with these provisions, there should be read subdivision (18) of the same section, which provides that no carrier by railroad subject to this act shall abandon all or any portion of a line of railroad, or the operation thereof, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity permit such abandonment. \n\n[265 U.S. 346, 352]\n\u00a0\n Carriers by water, such as appellee, are within the terms of the Transportation Act for certain purposes; e. g., for the regulation of their accounts, the making of reports, the prevention of rebates, discrimination, and the like. Certain provisions of the act are applicable to some carriers and not to others. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194, 208\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 436. The imposition of a duty upon a carrier by water to furnish transportation upon reasonable request does not create an obligation to continue to operate boats on a particular route. The provision of subdivision (18) above referred to is specifically limited to lines of railroad. This indicates legislative intention that carriers by water are not required to continue and may cease to operate if they see fit.\n No duty to continue to operate its boats on the Detroit and Mackinac Island route is imposed on appellee by its charter, the statutes of Michigan, the common law or federal statutes.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Appellants cited: Atlantic Coast Line v.

TILDEN PRODUCE CO(1924)\nNo. 139\nArgued: January 25, 1924Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 315, 316]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty.

J. Lynch, collector of internal revenue for the district of Minnesota, to recover \n\n[265 U.S. 315, 318]\n\u00a0\n $936 stamp taxes, which it was compelled to pay on 9,360 pounds of butter seized as adulterated by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. At the trial, a verdict was directed in favor of the company, and judgment was entered for the amount paid with interest. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 282 Fed. 54. The case is here on certiorari under section 240 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1217). \n260 U.S. 718\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 99.\n The question for decision is whether the butter was adulterated within the meaning of the Act of May 9, 1902, c. 784, 32 Stat. 193.\n In 1918, the company manufactured in its creamery at St. Paul 350 tubs of butter, which it shipped to Chicago. At the time it was made, the company tested the butter and found the moisture content to range between 15 and 16 per cent., and the average to be 15.68 per cent. Samples were taken at Chicago, and tested under the direction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. It was found that the moisture content of the butter in 156 tubs was 16 per cent. or more, that the range was between 16 and 17.93 per cent., and that the average was 16.76 per cent. The butter was made by the company by methods generally followed in the manufacture of butter in creameries. It was shown by the evidence that the moisture content in butter varies greatly; that the variation ranges from 9 to over 20 per cent., and that there is no fixed standard. The moisture content of milk is over 90 per cent., and of cream over 60 per cent. The making of butter involves the segregation of the fat and the elimination of water. After churning and draining off buttermilk, it is the general practice of buttermakers to use water to wash out curd and liquids remaining in association with the butter. While some of the water used for that purpose may remain, washing usually lessens the total moisture. Within certain limits, buttermakers are able to control water content. It is tested while the butter- \n\n[265 U.S. 315, 319]\n\u00a0\n is in the churn. It may be reduced by manipulation, or water may be incorporated into or mixed with the butter, so as to increase the water content, by working the butter under conditions calculated to accomplish that purpose. In practice, makers sometimes reduce or increase moisture content in order to meet competition in the market.\n Adulterated butter, as defined by section 4 of the Act of May 9, 1902 ( Comp. St.  6233), includes: (1) A grade produced by treatment of different lots of butter to which a chemical or other substance is added to deodorize it or to remove rancidity; (2) a butter product with which is mixed a foreign substance to lessen its cost; and (3) 'any butter in the manufacture or manipulation of which any process or material is used with intent or effect of causing the absorption of abnormal quantities of water, milk, or cream.'\n In 1907, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, promulgated Regulation No. 9, which contains the following:\n'Adulterated Butter Defined.-The definition of adulterated butter as contained in the Act of May 9, 1902, embraces butter in the manufacture of which any process or material is used whereby the product is made to 'contain abnormal quantities of water, milk or cream,' but the normal content of miosture permissible is not fixed by the act. This being the case it becomes necessary to adopt a standard for moisture in butter, which shall in effect represent the normal quantity. It is therefore held that butter having 16 per cent. or more of moisture contains an abnormal quantity and is classed as adulterated butter.'\n\n Petitioner contends that the promulgation of this regulation is authorized by section 20 of the Act of August 2, 1886, 24 Stat. 212 (Comp. St.  6232), and R. S.  251. It is provided by section 20 that:\n'The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may make all needful regulations for the carrying into effect of this act.'\n\n To a limited extent, this section \n\n[265 U.S. 315, 320]\n\u00a0\n was made applicable to the Act of May 9, 1902, by section 4 thereof (Comp. St.  6238), which provides that it 'shall apply to manufacturers of 'adulterated butter' to an extent necessary to enforce the marking, branding, identification and regulation of the exportation and importation of adulterated butter.' R. S.  251 (Comp. St.  384), authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to 'prescribe ... rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, to be used under and in the execution and enforcement of the various provisions of the internal revenue laws,' and to 'give such directions to collectors and prescribe such rules ... as may be necessary for the proper execution of the law. ...'\n The mere fact that the butter contains 16 per cent. or more of moisture does not bring it within the terms of the statutory definition of adulterated butter. Under the definition in section 4, there must be something in the manufacture or manipulation of the butter causing the absorption of abnormal quantities of water, milk or cream. This must result from the use of some material or process. The use must be with intent to cause such absorption, or must be calculated to produce that result. 'Absorption' should be read to include the introduction of moisture from the outside and the incorporation of water into the butter, whether it is technically an absorption or not. Obviously, it does not include moisture originally contained in the cream or butter. The act does not prescribe the amount of moisture permissible or fix any rule or criterion by which to determine the amount that is deemed 'abnormal' or that lawfully may be absorbed and incorporated.\n The regulation makes water content the sole test of adulteration, without regard to other provisions of the act. In support of its validity, it is said that, in declaring 16 per cent. of moisture in butter is abnormal, the regulation does no more than to establish a scientific fact. But \n\n[265 U.S. 315, 321]\n\u00a0\n it goes beyond that, and declares such butter to be adulterated. It omits essential elements of the statutory definition: namely, the use of a process or material in the manufacture of the butter, and the causing of absorption,-i. e., the incorporation or taking in from the outside-of abnormal quantities of moisture.\n Congress has not delegated power or authority to make such a regulation. Section 20 of the Act of August 2, 1886, does not apply. It is made applicable only in respect of the marking, branding, identification and regulation of exportation and importation of adulterated butter; it does not authorize a regulation establishing what shall be deemed to constitute excessive moisture or the 'absorption of abnormal quantities of water, milk or cream'; it grants no power to add to or take from the statutory definition of adulterated butter. Section 251 of the Revised Statutes confers upon the Secretary of the Treasury authority to make certain rules and regulations, but it grants no power to the Commission of Internal Revenue alone. To make any regulation by him on the subject effective, it must be approved by the Secretary, in which event it really becomes a regulation of the latter. Moreover, the rules and regulations authorized by section 251 are required to be 'not inconsistent with the law.' The regulation prescribes a standard which Congress has not authorized the Commissioner or the Secretary to fix. It sets up a definition of adulterated butter which conflicts with that contained in the act. The two cannot be read in harmony. If given effect, the regulation would eliminate from the definition of adulterated butter the conditions specified in the act and strike out words and phrases and substitute others for them. In effect, it would depart from and put aside the statutory definition. In some of the lower courts the regulation has been held invalid. United States v. 11,150 Pounds of Butter, 195 Fed. 657, 115 C. C. A. 463, affirming (D. C.) 188 Fed. 157; Baldwin Co-operative Creamery Association v. \n\n[265 U.S. 315, 322]\n\u00a0\n Williams (D. C.) 233 Fed. 607; Henningsen Produce Co. v. Whaley, (D. C.) 238 Fed. 650. But in Coopersville Cooperative Creamery Co. v. Lemon, 163 Fed. 145, 89 C. C. A. 595, it was held valid. We think that decision fails to take into account and give proper weight to the conflict between the act and the regulation. See Field v. Clark, \n143 U.S. 649\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 495, 36 L. Ed., 294; United States v. Eaton, \n144 U.S. 677\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 764; In re Kollock, \n165 U.S. 526\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 444; Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 U.S. 470\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 349; Williamson v.

It must be held that the regulation is invalid.\n The act does not prescribe any standard for moisture in butter. In its manufacture, the variation of moisture ranges above as well as below the quantities found in the butter in question, and its moisture content cannot be said to be 'abnormal.' It was made in the usual way. There was no process or material used with intent or effect of causing absorption of abnormal quantities of moisture. It was not adulterated within the meaning of the act.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMACKENZIE v. A ENGELHARD & SONS CO(1924)\nNo. 55\nArgued: October 9, 1924Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 131, 132]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., for Mackenzie.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 131, 136]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Verser Conner, of Louisville, Ky., for A. Engelhard & Sons.\n\n\n[266 U.S. 131, 140]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill brought by Mackenzie to compel the defendant corporation, A. Engelhard & Sons Co., to deliver to the plaintiff one hundred and thirty shares of \n\n[266 U.S. 131, 141]\n\u00a0\n stock formerly represented by certificate numbered 24, to the defendant, or to pay to him the value of the same, and the amount of all dividends declared upon the shares since July 15, 1918. The grounds are these:\n The plaintiff, being holder of a note for $7,500 and of the above mentioned certificate then standing in the name of F. W. R. Eschmann and unendorsed but stated in the note to be security, brought a suit against Eschmann, and others, makers of the note, and the corporation, in the Jefferson Circuit Court of Kentucky, to recover upon the note, to have it declared a lien upon the said stock and to have the lien enforced. He filed the certificate as an exhibit. The corporation was dismissed from the suit upon its demurrer, but of course had notice thereafter that the suit was pending and that the plaintiff claimed an interest in the stock. Indeed the plaintiff had previously sought to have the certificate that he held transferred to him as pledgee but had been refused. On November 7, 1914, judgment was rendered for the defendants and it was further adjudged that the defendant F. W. R. Eschmann be 'permitted' to withdraw the certificate from the exhibits, leaving a copy in the record. The plaintiff prayed an appeal but did not obtain a supersedeas, as he might have by giving a bond.\n Eschmann withdrew the certificate and on February 20, 1915, obtained in place of it new certificates to his wife and his attorney. On April 26, 1915, the plaintiff perfected his appeal to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky. On March 6, 1917, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment below (174 Ky. 450, 192 S. W. 521), and on October 31, 1917, final judgment was entered in the Jefferson Circuit Court that the plaintiff should recover the sum demanded and that he had a lien upon certificate No. 24, and the shares represented by it and upon any certificates that might have been issued by the corporation to the defendants, \n\n[266 U.S. 131, 142]\n\u00a0\n then the executors of F. W. R. Eschmann, deceased, in lieu of No. 24, to secure the plaintiff in the payment of the debt and costs. It was adjudged further that the shares should be sold and that the defendants should return the certificate to the court. On July 15, 1918, a sale was had, but the attorney for the defendants who also is attorney for the corporation attended and gave notice that the certificate had been sold by Eschmann and had been cancelled. The plaintiff bought for one hundred dollars and on October 30, 1918, the sale was confirmed by the court. Subsequently he demanded a certificate from the corporation but was refused. All its stock has been issued.\n In the present case the District Court decreed that the plaintiff recover his original debt and interest with a dividend declared after the purchase by the plaintiff, in all $13,354.75, with interest from the date of the decree until paid. Both parties appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court, while agreeing that the plaintiff was entitled to relief against the corporation, held that as the plaintiff had not obtained a supersedeas to the first judgment in the former suit and had taken no proceedings before the sale to establish what title would pass by it, his relief in equity should be limited to the amount of the debt, interest and costs in the other suit up to the time of sale, although the plaintiff's right was absolute at law. 286 F. 813. Writs of certiorari were issued on the petitions of both sides. \n262 \nU.S. 739\n, 43 S. Ct. 701\n\n\n It does not seem to us to need argument to establish that the sale to the plaintiff was effectual as against the parties to the suit. The decree confirming the sale was final and not appealed from. We believe the rule in Kentucky to be that purchasers pendente lite would stand in the defendant's shoes. An appeal is a proceeding in the original cause and the suit is pending until the \n\n[266 U.S. 131, 143]\n\u00a0\n appeal is disposed of. Therefore, apart from more special considerations applicable here but not needing mention, the assignees of the stock stood no better than Eschmann unless they were helped by the provision that 'an appeal shall not stay proceedings on a judgment unless a supersedeas be issued' in the Kentucky Civil Code,  747. But there was no question here of any proceedings on the judgment. When the final judgment was reached it determined the rights of Eschmann ab initio, and it seems to us impossible to believe that it did not also determine the rights of the assignees. We understand that this would be the view of the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Golden v. Riverside Coal & Timber Co., 184 Ky. 200, 205, 211 S. W. 761.\n The liability of the corporation rightly was found to exist by both courts below. The company might be liable even without fault, and if for any reason it were unable to restore the stock it might be answerable for its value. Telegraph Co. v. Davenport, \n97 U.S. 369\n, 372; Moores v. Citizens' National Bank, \n111 \nU.S. 156, 166\n, 4 S. Ct. 345. But here, as we have said, it had notice of the suit. It knew that the first judgment might be reversed, as it was, upon appeal, and was entitled to protect itself, as it might have and for all that appears may have done, when it issued the new certificates. We perceive no reason in the Kentucky Civil Code for distinguishing between its position and that of the assignees.\n We come then to the question whether equity requires any diminution of the rights acquired by the plaintiff under the judicial sale to him. It is adjudged that his rights are absolute. It is a strong thing to cut down his rights under the judgment of the state court. The parties stood upon equal ground. Without going further into the facts each seems to have been trying to get the better of the other and neither can get much help from atmospheric considerations. The plaintiff did not care \n\n[266 U.S. 131, 144]\n\u00a0\n to assume the liabilities of a supersedeas bond, but if the defendant took no steps to protect itself it might have done so. The plaintiff was not bound to pursue the assignees of the stock before looking to the corporation. St. Romes v. Levee Steam Cotton Press Co., \n127 \nU.S. 614, 620\n, 8 S. Ct. 1335. It is immaterial what were the limits of the plaintiff's original interest; he comes before this court as absolutely entitled to the stock and the preliminaries to his acquiring the title have no bearing on the case. He got it at a better bargain than he would have done had his adversaries taken a different course, but he got it and his right is not to be impugned. See Miller v. Doran, 245 Ill. 200, 91 N.

From a judgment dismissing all of the writs, petitioners appeal. Judgment reversed, with directions not to discharge petitioners until the Secretary of Labor shall have a reasonable time in which to correct and perfect his findings, or to initiate another proceeding against them. \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 33]\n\u00a0\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the District Court of the United States for Northern Illinois, dismissing five writs of habeas corpus and remanding the appellants, who are aliens, to the custody of the Immigration Inspector at Chicago for deportation, in pursuance \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n to warrants issued by the Secretary of Labor. The cases were consolidated in the court below.\n In 1918, all the appellants were tried and found guilty of violation of section 5 of the Selective Service Act of May 18, 1917 (chapter 15, 40 Stat. 76, 80 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2044e]), and of section 4 of the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917 (chapter 30, 40 Stat. 217, 222 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10212d]). All but Petro Nigra were sentenced to the United States penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kan ., for a period of 5 years, and Nigra was sentenced to the same place for 18 months. Upon error to the Court of Appeals these sentences were affirmed and became final.\n Pending the imprisonment of appellants, the Secretary of Labor issued warrants for arrest of the appellants under the Act of May 10, 1920, c. 174, 41 Stat. 593 (Comp.

Henning, Assistant Secretary of Labor, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the laws of the United States, do hereby command you to return said alien to Canada the country whence he came, at the expense of the appropriation, 'Expenses of Regulating Immigration, 1922.'\n\n'For so doing this shall be your sufficient warrant.\n\n'Witness my hand and seal this 10th day of November, 1921\n\n\n\n'[Signed] E. J. Henning,\n\n'Assistant Secretary of Labor.'\n\n The Act of Congress enacted May 10, 1920 (chapter 174, 41 Stat. 593) provides that aliens of certain classes described in the act, in addition to those for whose expulsion authority already exists, shall, upon the warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken into his custody and deported in the manner provided in sections 19 and 20 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917 (39 Stat. p. 889 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 jj, 4289 1\/4 k]), 'if the Secretary of Labor, after hearing, finds that such aliens are undesirable residents of the United States.' The classes include all aliens interned as enemies by the President's proclamation under R. S.  4067 (Comp. St.  7615) and alien convicts under the Espionage Act, the Explosives \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n Act, the act restricting foreign travel, the Sabotage Act, the Selective Draft Act, the act punishing threats against the President, the Trading with the Enemy Act, and certain sections of the Penal Code. Section 2 makes the decision of the Secretary of Labor in ordering expulsion of an alien under the act final.\n The petitions for writs of habeas corpus charged that the warrant of deportation under which the petitioners were held were void because, at the time of the issue of the warrants, the Espionage Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  1012a et seq.) and the Selective Draft Act ( Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2044a et seq.), for convictions under which they were about to be deported, had been repealed, that the Act of May 10, 1920, under which the warrant was issued, was an ex post facto law, because the convictions for which they were to be deported were for acts committed before its passage, that there was no legal evidence to establish that petitioners were aliens amenable to deportation under the act, that the hearing and proceedings were without due process of law, and that for these and other reasons the commitment was void.\n Counsel for the appellants, in their brief and in their argument, attacked the constitutionality of the act of 1920, not only because it was an ex post facto law, but because it delegated legislative power to an executive officer, and because the criterion for his finding-i. e., that the persons to be deported should be 'undesirable residents of the United States'-was so vague and uncertain that it left the liberty of the alien to the whim and caprice of an executive officer, in violation of due process required by the Fifth Amendment. They further attacked the validity of the warrants on the ground that they did not show a finding by the Secretary that the appellants were undesirable residents of the United States, a condition precedent to a legal deportation. They further alleged that as to all the petitioners there was no evidence to sustain such a finding, if it had been made, and that as \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 38]\n\u00a0\n to Petro Nigra there was also a fatal lack of evidence at his hearing to show that he had been convicted of the violations of the statutes charged in the warrant.\n Messrs. Walter Nelles, of New York City, and Otto Christensen, of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Mr. Geo. Ross Hull, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The theory of the draftsman of the petition for the writ and of the assignment of errors was that the same \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 39]\n\u00a0\n constitutional restrictions apply to an alien deportation act as to a law punishing crime. It is well settled that deportation, while it may be burdensome and severe for the alien, is not a punishment. Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 730\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 1016; Bugajewitz v. Adams, \n228 \nU.S. 585, 591\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 607. The right to expel aliens is a sovereign power, necessary to the safety of the country, and only limited by treaty obligations in respect thereto entered into with other governments. Fong Yue Ting v. United States, supra. The inhibition against the passage of an ex post facto law by Congress in section 9 of article 1 of the Constitution applies only to criminal laws, Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386; Johannessen v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 227, 242\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 613; and not to a deportation act like this, Bugajewitz v. Adams, \n228 \nU.S. 585, 591\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 607. Congress by the act of 1920 was not increasing the punishment for the crimes of which petitioners had been convicted, by requiring their deportation if found undesirable residents. It was, in the exercise of its unquestioned right, only seeking to rid the country of persons who had shown by their career that their continued presence here would not make for the safety or welfare of society. In Hawker v. New York, \n170 U.S. 189\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 573, the validity of a law of New York which forbade, on penalty, any one who had been convicted of a felony from practicing medicine, was upheld as a reasonable exercise of the police power, and not an increase of the punishment for the felony. The present is even a clearer case than that.\n The brief for appellants insists that, as the laws under which the appellants were convicted have been repealed, the fact of their conviction cannot be made the basis for deportation. It was their past conviction that put them in the class of persons liable to be deported as undesirable citizens. That record for such a purpose was not affected by the repeal of the laws which they had violated, and under which they had suffered punishment. The repeal \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 40]\n\u00a0\n did not take the convicted persons out of the enumerated classes, or take from the convictions any probative force rightly belonging to them.\n Nor is the act invalid in delegating legislative power to the Secretary of Labor. The sovereign power to expel aliens is political, and is vested in the political departments of the government. Even if the executive may not exercise it without congressional authority, Congress cannot exercise it effectively save through the executive. It cannot, in the nature of things, designate all the persons to be excluded. It must accomplish its purpose by classification and by conferring power of selection within classes upon an executive agency. Tiaco v. Forbes, \n228 \nU.S. 549, 557\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 585. That is what it has done here. It has established classes of persons who in its judgment constitute an eligible list for deportation, of whom the Secretary is directed to deport those he finds to be undesirable residents of this country. With the background of a declared policy of Congress to exclude aliens classified in great detail by their undesirable qualities in the Immigration Act of 1917, and in previous legislation of a similar character, we think the expression 'undesirable residents of the United States' is sufficiently definite to make the delegation quite within the power of Congress. As far back as 1802 the naturalization statute of that year (chapter 28, 2 Stat. 153) prescribed that no alien should be naturalized who did not appear to the court to have behaved during his residence in this country 'as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.' Our history has created a common understanding of the words 'undesirable residents' which gives them the quality of a recognized standard.\n We do not think that the discretion vested in the Secretary under such circumstances is any more vague or \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 41]\n\u00a0\n uncertain or any less defined than that exercised in deciding whether aliens are likely to become a public charge, a discretion vested in the immigration executives for half a century and never questioned. Act Aug. 3, 1882, c. 376 (22 Stat. 214), and Act Feb. 5, 1917, c. 29 (39 Stat. 874 [ Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 a]). See Buttfield v. Stranahan, Ed. 525.\n International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 216\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 853, and United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 U.S. 81\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 298, 14 A. L. R. 1045, are cited on behalf of petitioners. In those cases, statutes were held invalid for vagueness. They were both criminal cases, in which the uncertain words of the statute encountered the limitation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. They did not inform the accused sufficiently of the nature and cause of the accusation. The rule as to a definite standard of action is not so strict in cases of the delegation of legislative power to executive boards and officers. Cases like the one before us were distinguished from the Cohen Case by Chief Justice White in his opinion in that case, when he said (page 92 [41 Sup. Ct. 301]):\n'The cases relied upon all rested upon the conclusion that, for reasons found to result either from the text of the statutes involved or the subjects with which they dealt, a standard of some sort was afforded.'\n\n The next objection is that there was no evidence before the immigration inspector and the Secretary upon which a warrant could properly issue. A special objection of this kind is taken in the case of Petro Nigra. It is said that in the record of the hearing of his case before the inspector there does not appear any evidence of his conviction under the Espionage and Selective Draft Acts. It is true that the certified copies of the indictment and judgment against all the petitioners do not appear in the hearing of Nigra as shown, but there is a stipulation between the parties in another part of the record herein that such certified copies were used in the hearing of each \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 42]\n\u00a0\n petitioner. It is clear that the hearing of Nigra was not properly reported, and that his case is like the others.\n But it is said there was no evidence in the hearings of any of them as to their being undesirable residents of the United States. There were their convictions. Those were enough to justify the Secretary in finding that they were undesirable. The statute does not expressly require additional evidence. If it did, there was here the circumstance that, after the examination of the petitioners had proceeded to a certain point of inquiry, the petitioners under the advice of counsel declined to answer further questions, an attitude from which the Secretary might well infer that what would be revealed by answers would not add to their desirability as residents. Of course, the question how much additional evidence should be required must vary with the class which makes its members eligible for deportation. Alien enemies interned during war may be very good people, and their having been interned may have little bearing on their being good material for residents or citizens when peace returns; but the aliens in this case were convicted of crimes under such circumstances that the Secretary, without more, might find them undesirable as residents.\n But the Secretary made no express finding so far as the warrant for deportation discloses. It is contended that this renders the warrant invalid. It is answered on behalf of the appellee that, in habeas corpus proceedings, the prisoner is not to be discharged for defects in the original arrest or commitument, because the object of the proceeding is not like an action to recover damages for an unlawful arrest or commitment, but is to ascertain whether the prisoner can lawfully be detained in custody, citing Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 651, 662\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 336. What that case really decided was that, even if the arrest was unjustified by the warrant or commitment on its face, yet if the evidence on the hearing of the petition for habeas \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 43]\n\u00a0\n corpus showed either that facts existed at the time of the arrest or had occurred since, which made the detention legal, the court would not release the prisoner, but would do what justice required and would dispose of the prisoner accordingly. Iasigi v. Van De Carr, \n166 U.S. 391\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 595; Stallings v. Splain, \n253 \nU.S. 339, 343\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 537; United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, \n263 \nU.S. 149, 158\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 54, 68 L. Ed. --; United States ex rel. Mensevich v. Tod, \n264 U.S. 134\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 282, 68 L. Ed. --, decided this day.\n In the case before us the defect in the warrants of deportation has not been supplied. The defect is jurisdictional. There is no authority given to the Secretary to deport, except upon his finding after a hearing that the petitioners were undesirable residents. There is no evidence that he made such a finding, except what is found in the warrant of deportation. The warrants recite that upon the evidence the Secretary has become satisfied that the petitioner aliens have been found in the United States in violation of the Act of May 10, 1920, and that they were finally convicted of the offenses named in the act. They could not have been found in the United States in violation of the act of 1920 until after the Secretary had found that they were undesirable residents. Appellees' argument is that, therefore, this must be taken to mean that he finds them undesirable citizens. But the words 'have been found' naturally refer to a time when the warrant of arrest was served on them, and before he had them before him. They exclude a possible meaning that he was then making their stay in the country illegal by implication of a finding that they were undesirable. This conclusion is borne out by the language of the Secretary in the warrant of arrest, which before the hearings he issued against the petitioners, and in which he directed their arrest on the ground that they had been found in the United States in violation of the Act of May 10, 1920. It would clearly appear from these two documents, which are naturally to be construed in pari materia, that the \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 44]\n\u00a0\n Secretary did not deem his finding that the petitioners were undesirable citizens essential to enable him to deport them. Indeed, he seems to have used forms applicable to aliens of a fixed excluded class, to be deported on identification with the class, without any further finding by him. The natural construction of his language is that he has become satisfied that they are in the country in violation of the act solely because they have been convicted as stated.\n Does this omission invalidate the warrant? The finding is made a condition precedent to deportation by the statute. It is essential that, where an executive is exercising delegated legislative power he should substantially comply with all the statutory requirements in its exercise, and that, if his making a finding is a condition precedent to this act, the fulfillment of that condition should appear in the record of the act. In Wichita R. R. & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n260 U.S. 48\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 51, a statute of a state required that a Public Utility Commission should find existing rates to be unreasonable before reducing them, but there was no specific requirement that the order should contain the finding. We held that the order in that case, made after a hearing and ordering a reduction, was void for lack of the express finding in the order. We put this conclusion, not only on the language of the statute, but also on general principles of constitutional government. After pointing out the necessity for such delegation of certain legislative power to executive agencies we said (page 59 [43 Sup. Ct. 55]):\n'In creating such an administrative agency the Legislature, to prevent its being a pure delegation of legislative power, must enjoin upon it a certain course of procedure and certain rules of decision in the performance of its function. It is a wholesome and necessary principle that such an agency must pursue the procedure and rules enjoined and show a substantial compliance therewith to \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 45]\n\u00a0\n give validity to its action. When, therefore, such an administrative agency is required as a condition precedent to an order, to make a finding of facts, the validity of the order must rest upon the needed finding. If it is lacking, the order is ineffective.\n\n'It is pressed on us that the lack of an express finding may be supplied by implication and by reference to the averments of the petition invoking the action of the commission. We cannot agree to this.'\n\n If the principle thus stated is to be consistently adhered to, it is difficult in any view to give validity to the warrants of deportation before us.\n It is said that no exception was taken to the warrant on this account until the filing of the brief of counsel in this court. There was an averment that the warrant was void without definite reasons in the petition of habeas corpus. There was nothing of the kind in the assignment of error. But we may under our rules notice a plain and serious error though unassigned. Rule 21,  4, and rule 35,  1, 222 U. S. appendix, pp. 27, 37; Wiborg v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 632, 658\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 1127, 1197; Clyatt v. United States, \n197 \nU.S. 207, 221\n, 222 S., 25 Sup. Ct. 429; Crawford v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 183, 194\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 260, 15 Ann. Cas. 392; Weems v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 349, 362\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 544, 19 Ann. Cas. 705. The character of the defect is such that we cannot relieve ourselves from its consideration. The warrant lacks the finding required by the statute, and such a fundamental defect we should notice. It goes to the existence of the power on which the proceeding rests. It is suggested that, if the objection had been made earlier, it might have been quickly remedied. There was no chance for objection afforded the petitioners until, after the warrant issued, in the petition for habeas corpus. The defect may still be remedied on the objection made in this court.\n We need not discharge the petitioners at once because of the defective warrant. By section 761 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1289) the duty of the court or judge in habeas corpus proceedings is prescribed as follows: \n\n[264 U.S. 32, 46]\n\u00a0\n 'The court, or justice, or judge shall proceed in a summary way to determine the facts of the case, by hearing the testimony and arguments, and thereupon to dispose of the party as law and justice require.'\n Under this section, this court has often delayed the discharge of the petitioner for such reasonable time as may be necessary to have him taken before the court where the judgment was rendered, that defects which renderdischarge necessary may be corrected. In re Bonner, Petitioner, \n151 \nU.S. 242, 261\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 323; Medley, Petitioner, \n134 \nU.S. 160, 174\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 384; Coleman v. Tennessee, \n97 U.S. 509\n; United States v. McBratney, \n104 U.S. 621\n, 624; Bryant v. United States, 214 Fed. 51, 53, 130 C. C. A. 491. The same rule should be applied in habeas corpus proceedings to test the legality of confinement under the decision of an administrative tribunal like the Secretary of Labor in deportation cases. No time limitation is imposed upon proceedings under the Act of May 10, 1920. If upon the evidence the Secretary finds that these petitioners are undersirable residents and issues warrants of deportation reciting that finding with the other jurisdictional facts, there will then be no reason, so far as this record discloses, why they should not be deported.\n Accordingly the judgment of the District Court is reversed with directions not to discharge the petitioners until the Secretary of Labor shall have reasonable time in which to correct and perfect his finding on the evidence produced at the original hearing, if he finds it adequate, or to initiate another proceeding against them. \n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMANUFACTURERS' CO. v. FLEET CORP.(1924)\nNo. 181\nArgued: January 21, 1924Decided: March 3, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Francis D. Weaver, of Camden, N. J., for plaintiff in error.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action in ejectment by the land company against the Fleet Corporation and the Public Service Company \n\n[264 U.S. 250, 251]\n\u00a0\n for a small tract of land in Camden, N. J. The action was begun in a state court and removed to the District Court of the United States, where, after trial, judgment was given for the defendants. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 284 Fed. 231.\n The facts out of which the case arose are easily stated.\n On and prior to May 28, 1918, the land in question was owned and possessed by the land company, and was without buildings or other improvements. It was in close proximity to shipyards where ships were being constructed for the United States for service in the World War, and was also in close proximity to other lands in which the Fleet Corporation had acquired an interest and on which it had caused, or was causing, many houses to be constructed for the use of the shipyard employees and their families. On that day the Fleet Corporation, acting under the Act of March 1, 1918, c. 19, 40 Stat. 438 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  8146t), requisitioned the feesimple title of the land and took possession. Afterwards, in conformity to the act, the Fleet Corporation determined the compensation to be made for the land, the amount being $19,743.20. The land company did not accept that sum or any part of it, but questioned the authority of the Fleet Corporation to make the requisition and take possession.\n After the land was requisitioned, the Fleet Corporation constructed thereon a loop of electric railway tracks with platforms and sheds, connected the same with an adjacent electric railway line operated by the public service company, and contracted with that company to run its cars over the newly made loop to and from the platforms and sheds so constructed, all for the purpose of providing necessary and convenient transportation facilities for the employees of the shipyards and their families. The land was suitable for that purpose and, when the improvements were completed, was used therefor under the contract \n\n[264 U.S. 250, 252]\n\u00a0\n between the Fleet Corporation and the Public Service Company. No houses were constructed on the land by the Fleet Corporation; nor was it used otherwise than in providing the transportation facilities just described.\n The action in ejectment was brought on the assumption that the land was unlawfully taken by the Fleet Corporation in that the declared purpose of the taking was to use the land in housing the employees and their families, when in truth the purpose was to use it for an electric railway terminal, or to enable the Public Service Company so to use it, and that the Fleet Corporation was without authority to take it for such terminal use. Whether that assumption was well or ill grounded is the question presented on this writ of error.\n The material part of the Act of March 1, 1918, under which the Fleet Corporation acted, reads as follows:\n'That the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation is hereby authorized and empowered within the limits of the amounts herein authorized--\n\n'(a) To purchase, lease, requisition, including the requisition of the temporary use of, or acquire by condemnation or otherwise any improved or unimproved land or any interest therein suitable for the construction thereon of houses for the use of employees and the families of employees of shipyards in which ships are being constructed for the United States.\n\n'(b) To construct on such land for the use of such employees and their families houses and all other necessary or convenient facilities, upon such conditions and at such price as may be determined by it, and to sell, lease, or exchange such houses, land, and facilities upon such terms and conditions as it may determine.\n\n'(c) To purchase, lease, requisition, including the requisition of the temporary use of, or acquire by condemnation or otherwise any houses or other buildings for the use of such employees and their families, together with the land \n\n[264 U.S. 250, 253]\n\u00a0\n on which the same are erected, or any interest therein, all necessary and proper fixtures and furnishings therefor, and all necessary and convenient facilities incidental thereto; to manage, repair, sell, lease, or exchange such lands, houses, buildings, fixtures, furnishings and facilities upon such terms and conditions as it may determine to carry out the purposes of this act.\n\n'(d) To make loans to persons, firms, or corporations in such manner upon such terms and security, and for such time not exceeding ten years, as it may determine to provide houses and facilities for the employees and the families of employees of such shipyards.\n\n'Whenever said United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation shall acquire by requisition or condemnation such property or any interest therein, it shall determine and make just compensation therefor, and if the amount thereof so determined is unsatisfactory to the person entitled to receive the same, such person shall be paid seventy-five per centum of the amount so determined, and shall be entitled to sue the United States to recover such further sum as added to such seventy-five per centum will make such an amount as will be just compensation for the property or interest therein so taken.'\n\n The requisition, as set forth in the record, shows that the land was desired and was taken 'for the uses and purposes' expressed in the act, and not, as asserted by the land company, for the sole and declared purpose of using it for housing the employees and their families. So, if the act authorized a taking to provide necessary or convenient facilities whereby these people readily could reach and use local car lines, that purpose was comprehended in the terms of the requisition.\n The land company apparently takes the position that subdivision (a) of the act is alone to be considered. If this position were right, there would be good ground for \n\n[264 U.S. 250, 254]\n\u00a0\n thinking that the only purpose for which a taking was authorized was to provide housing facilities. But subdivision (b) must also be considered. It and subdivision (a) are so plainly interrelated that they must be read together. When this is done, it is obvious that the purposes for which a taking was authorized were not confined to providing housing facilities but extended to providing 'all other necessary or convenient facilities' for the use of the employees and their families. Other parts of the act, notably subdivisions (c) and (d), strengthen this conclusion. Of course the act must be examined as a whole, and not as if each part were an independent enactment. Its purpose was to facilitate the accomplishment of large undertakings wherein it was necessary to employ artisans and laborers in unusually large numbers, and to utilize their services in the best possible way. It recognized not only that they and their families should be housed, but that many other necessary or convenient facilities should be provided for their use, and to these ends it authorized an expenditure of $50,000,000.\n Whether artisans or laborers could be obtained and retained in requisite numbers would measurably be affected by the conditions surrounding them in the employment, such as the facilities for going from their places of living to their places of work, and the converse, and the facilities for reaching markets, schools and churches from their places of living.\n Here what was done was to provide facilities whereby an extensive electric railway service in the city of Camden was brought, with a suitable terminal, into close proximity to the shipyards and to the lands where houses were provided for the use of the employees and their families. In our opinion these transportation facilities were of a class which the Fleet Corporation was authorized to provide and for which it was empowered to requisition or take needed land. They were a legitimate complement \n\n[264 U.S. 250, 255]\n\u00a0\n to the housing facilities provided by the corporation in that vicinity-at great cost according to the record. It was not essential under the act that the other facilities be on the same tract with the houses any more than that all the houses be on a single tract. The act was intended to be susceptible of practical application in varying situations.\n We conclude that the action of ejectment was brought on a mistaken assumption and was rightly determined against the land company by the courts below. Questions which would arise if the assumption or any material part of it were well grounded need not be considered.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA (dissenting).\n I concur in the judgment of the court. I dissent from the grounds upon which the court bases it. It is my opinion that the record establishes that the requisition of the land was made under the first paragraph (a) of the Housing Act of March 1, 1918, the fee simple in the land acquired and, necessarily, it became subject to all of the uses accessorial to the fee, every use whatever; for the use of trolley tracks to connect with a street railway as in this case, or to the erection of a church for the spiritual guidance of employees and their families, or for a dance hall and an accompanying refectory for the amusement of their leisure. Indeed for any use under the sun.\n Twenty days after the requisition, the President seeing the situation and that the land was so subject, availed of it-availed of the power given him under the Act of April 22, 1918 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/16d, 3115 1\/16dd) to take over transportation systems for the transportation of shipyard and plant employees, issuing his executive order of June 18, 1918, by which he directed that the Fleet Corporation should 'have and exercise all power and authority vested' in him by \n\n[264 U.S. 250, 256]\n\u00a0\n the act. By this direction and delegation, the Fleet Corporation proceeded to construct the trolley tracks with the assistance of the Public Service Railway Company, a defendant in the case. The land became a terminal for the latter company.\n The act of the President was in the public service, but it was not an act of requisition of the land, it was after the requisition of the land- not its requisition. If this were not so there is color for the accusation of the Land & Improvement Company that the Housing Act was used as a pretense-used under the pretense of acquiring land for the building of houses when the purpose was, in effect, a different one.\n During the taking of the testimony, counsel for the Fleet corporation several times declared that the requisition was under the Housing Act and that whatever use the land was subsequently put to was immaterial.\n I quote from the record (page 31) as follows:\n'Now, then, the power under which we took this land was a power delegated under 40 Stat. 438, directly delegated to the Fleet Corporation, so that we could not in this requisition say that the Fleet Corporation took this land by virtue of the Act of March 1, 1918, and by virtue of the Act of April 22, 1918, because the power was not given to us under both of those acts; it was only given under one of them.\n\n'The Court: You claim you were the deputy of the President?\n\n'Mr. Pearse: Later.\n\n'Mr. Jacobsen: After the taking of the land we claim we were. At the time we took the land we had the right to take it by virtue of statute, and after we used it by virtue of power delegated to us by the President. [Italics mine.] Those are the actual facts; in other words, we took this land under a direct power delegated to us.' \n\n[264 U.S. 250, 257]\n\u00a0\n It will be observed that Mr. Pearse, of counsel for the Fleet Corporation, in response to the court's inquiry as to when the Fleet Corporation became the deputy of the President, answered, 'Later.' It will also be observed that Mr. Jacobsen, of counsel for the Fleet Corporation, continuing his comment, said that 'after the taking of the land we [the Fleet Corporation] claim we were'; 'later,' and 'after the taking of the land,' meaning after the executive order.' Until it there is nothing in the record to show that there was prophecy or thought of trolley tracks or transportation systems.\n\n The opinion of the court now delivered is, in my view, in opposition to this. There is an attempt at consistency with it by the declaration that the requisition was under the act, and for the uses and purposes expressed in the act, and that the uses and purposes were facilities for neighboring shipyards. In determining the correctness of this conclusion, all paragraphs of the act must, of course, be considered, but not one of them has provision for any housing of employees, except what houses may be erected on the land and for the employees who should occupy them.\n As I have said, the President's order was moved by consideration of the public service. The difference between the court and me is how the service was accomplished-was it by requisition of the land or the use of the land after requisition?\n I think the latter; the court declares the former. In other words, it was a part of the requisition. Of course, the occupation of the land after the construction of the trolley tracks was as useful, whether the right was acquired and exercised, one way as the other. The trolley would be a facility as much in one case as in the other; and to ascribe it to one and not to the other is to give that one a gloss and show that it is denied to the other-a fictitious importance.\n I repeat, the difference between the court and me is one of means, not of effect, and my view is that of the Circuit \n\n[264 U.S. 250, 258]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals; it is that of the Land & Improvement Company; it is, in essential foundation, that of the government. These circumstances cannot, of course, obstruct the declaration of superior authority, as this court is, although the grounds of the exertion of the authority may surprise.o \n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMATTHEW ADDY CO. v. U S(1924)\nNo. 84\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1924\n\n\n\n Messrs. Julius R. Samuels and Nelson B.

C., for the United States. \n\n[264 U.S. 239, 240]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners were found guilty of violating the President's order of August 23, 1917, by receiving margins above those prescribed for coal jobbers. Both causes present the same fundamental questions and one opinion will suffice.\n The Lever Act, 'An act to provide further for the national security and defense by encouraging the production, \n\n[264 U.S. 239, 241]\n\u00a0\n conserving the supply, and controlling the distribution of food products and fuel,' approved August 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 284, 286 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 q, 3115 1\/8 qq), provides:\n'Sec. 25. That the President of the United States shall be, and he is hereby, authorized and empowered, whenever and wherever in his judgment necessary for the efficient prosecution of the war, to fix the price of coal and coke, wherever and whenever sold, either by producer or dealer, to establish rules for the rugulation of and to regulate the method of production, sale, shipment, distribution, apportionment, or storage thereof among dealers and consumers, domestic or foreign; said authority and power may be exercised by him in each case through the agency of the Federal Trade Commission during the war or for such part of said time as in his judgment may be necessary. ...\n\n'Whoever shall, with knowledge that the prices of any such commodity have been fixed as herein provided, ask, demand, or receive a higher price, or whoever shall, with knowledge that the regulations have been prescribed as herein provided, violate or refuse to conform to any of the same, shall, upon conviction, be punished by fine of not more than $5,000, or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both. Each independent transaction shall constitute a separate offense.'\n\n'Sec. 26. That any person carrying on or employed in commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, or with or in the territories or other possessions of the United States in any article suitable for human food, fuel, or other necessaries of life, who, either in his individual capacity or as an officer, agent, or employee of a corporation or member of a partnership carring on or employed in such trade, shall store, acquire, or hold, or who shall destroy or make away with any such article for the purpose of limiting the supply thereof to the public or affecting the market price thereof in such commerce, whether \n\n[264 U.S. 239, 242]\n\u00a0\n temporarily or otherwise, shall be deemed guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $ 5,000 or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both. ...'\n\n On August 21, 1917, after prescribing a schedule of prices for bituminous coal at the mine, the President said:\n'It is provisional only. It is subject to reconsideration when the whole metnod of administering the fuel supplies of the country shall have been satisfactorily organized and put into operation. Subsequent measures will have as their object a fair and equitable control of the distribution of the supply and of the prices not only at the mines but also in the hands of the middlemen and the retailers.'\n\n August 23, 1917, pending further investigation and determination, it was ordered by the President:\n'A coal jobber is defined as a person (or other agency) who purchases and resells coal to coal dealers or to consumers without physically handling it on, over, or throught his own vehicle, dock, trestle, or yard. For the buying and selling of bituminous coal a jobber shall not add to his purchases price a gross margin in excess of 15 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds, nor shall the combined gross margins of any number of jobbers who buy and sell a given shipment or shipments of bituminous coal exceed 15 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds.'\n\n September 6, 1917, the Fuel Administrator directed that--\n'Contracts relating to bituminous coal made before the proclamation of the President on August 21, and contracts relating to anthractite coal made before the President's proclamation of August 23, are not affected by these proclamations, provided the contracts are bona fide in character and are enforceable at law.'\n\n [On August 23 the President issued an order fixing prices for anthracite coal at the mines, effective September 1st.]\n A statement and order by the Fuel Administrator, dated September 7, 1917, contained the following paragraphs: \n\n[264 U.S. 239, 243]\n\u00a0\n 'A very large proportion of the coal supply available for the coming winter is under contract. These contracts, which are allowed to stand for, the present, were made prior to the President's proclamation and very largely limit the amount which may be placed on sale at retail prices based on the President's order.\n'It is absolutely essential, however, that a sufficient amount of coal be put on the market at once at these prices to meet the needs of domestic consumers. The Fuel Administration believes that this supply of coal can be made available and will be made availabe by voluntary arrangement between the operators and those with whom they have contracts, and thus make it unnecessary for the Fuel Administration to exercise or recommend the exercise of the powers provided in the Lever Act.'\n\n On October 6, 1917, the Fuel Administrator further directed--\n'Coal may be bought and sold at prices lower than those prescribed by the orders of the President.\n\n'The effect of the President's orders on coal rolling when the order affecting such coal was issued is to be decided by first ascertaining whether or not the title had passed from the operator to the consignee at the time the President's order became effective. If the title had passed to the consignee, the price fixed by the President does not apply. ...\n\n'A jobber who had already contracted to buy coal at the time of the President's order fixing the price of such coal, and who was at that time already under contract to sell the same, may fill his contracts to sell at the price named therein.\n\n'A jobber who, at the time of the President's order fixing the price of the coal in question at the mine, had contracted to buy coal at or below the President's price, and at that time had no contract to sell such coal, shall not sell the same at a price higher than the purchase price plus \n\n[264 U.S. 239, 244]\n\u00a0\n the proper jobber's commission as determined by the President's regulation of August 23, 1917\n\n\n\n'A jobber who, at the time of the President's order fixing the price of the coal in question, was under contract to deliver such coal at a price higher than a price represented by the price fixed by the President or the Fuel Administrator for such coal plus a proper jobber's commission as determined by the President's regulation of August 23, 1917, shall not fill such contract at a price in excess of the President's price plus the proper jobber's commission, with coal purchased after the President's order became effective and not contracted for prior thereto.\n\n'A jobber who, at the date of the President's order fixing the price of the coal in question, held a contract for the purchased of coal without having already sold such coal, shall not sell such coal at more than the price fixed by the President or the Fuel Administrator for the sale of such coal after the date of such order, plus the jobber's commission as fixed by the President's regulation of August 23, 1917,'\n\n The Fuel Administrator issued many other orders, not presently important.\n The petitioning corporation, Matthew Addy Company, acting by petitioner Ford, the Vice President, did business as coal jobber at Cincinnati, Ohio. By contract dated July 31, 1917, it purchased many carloads of coal from Bluefield Coal and Coke Company, at $3.25 per ton f. o. b. the mines in West Virginia. With knowledge of jobbers' margins fixed by the President's order of August 23, 1917, it sold sundry lots of this coal during August and September, 1917, at $3.50 per ton f. o. b. the mines, without having contracted so to do before that order issued. Do these circumstances suffice to establish the offense charged? We think not; and, accordingly, the judgments below must be reversed.\n The order must be construed as criminal statutes are-strictly and without retroactive effect unless clearly indicated. \n\n[264 U.S. 239, 245]\n\u00a0\n Chew Heong v. United States, \n112 \nU.S. 536, 559\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 255; Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 \nU.S. 529, 534\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 391, 26 A. L. R. 1454. If it be construed as applying to the sales of coal purchased by petitioners prior to August 23d, we must decide a grave constitutional question, not necessary to consider if another view be accepted. Under the existing circumstances, did Congress have power to fix prices at which persons then owning coal must sell thereafter, if they sold at all, without provinding compensation for losses? If this difficulty can be eliminated by some reasonable construction of the order, it should be accepted. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 407\n, 408 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 527.\n The above quoted statements and orders show plainly enough that in August, 1917, a very large part of the available coal supply was under contract. This greatly limited the amount which 'may be placed on sale at retail prices based on the President's order,' as pointed out on September 7th. Nevertheless, the contracts were 'allowed to stand for the present.' Evidently the purpose was to begin the administration of the fuel supplies by regulating subsequent transactions without striking down all existing bona fide contracts which might affect such supplies. If, prior to August 23d, petitioners had agreed to sell coal purchased in July, such contracts would not have been within the order. October 6th more sweeping rules were promulgated; one of them has direct relation to circumstances like those here presented.\n The order treated buying and selling as integral parts of the regulated transaction and made no reference to expenses incident thereto. If it applied only to transactions thereafter begun, all had opportunity to govern themselves accordingly; but, if given retroactive effect, jobbers who had negotiated purchases at costs exceeding fifteen cents per ton would necessarily lose if they sold, although they had acted in entire good faith. Certainly, there was no purpose to encourage hoarding, contrary to \n\n[264 U.S. 239, 246]\n\u00a0\n the Lever Act,  26, or to retard movement of fuel to the ultimate consumers by making sales unprofitable. No imperative reason appears for treating jobbers who had bought but had not contracted to sell with less consideration than was accorded those with agreements for sales, irrespective of the stipulated price.\n Considering the ordinary rules of interpretation and the circumstances disclosed, we conclude that the order of August 23d did not apply to the sales in question. It was not retroactive, and the sales were but part of a transaction begun before its date. We are not unmindful of the forceful argument to the contrary; and we consciously refrain from indicating any opinion respecting the validity of the order as interpreted.\n The judgments of the court below are reversed and the causes will be remanded to the Distict Court for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCARTHY v. ARNDSTEIN(1924)\nNo. 404\nArgued: November 27, 1923Decided: October 20, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 34, 35]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Selden Bacon, of New York City, for National Surety Co.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 34, 38]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

Randolph Montgomery, of New York City, for National Ass'n of Credit Men.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1920, Arndstein was adjudged an involuntary bankrupt in the Southern district of New York. Pursuant to a subpoena, he appeared before a special commissioner for examination as to his assets under section 21a of the Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, 552, as amended by Act Feb. 5, 1903,  7 (Comp. St.  9605), was sworn as a witness, and freely answered some questions. Others he refused to answer on the ground that to do so might tend to incriminate him. Having persisted in this refusal, after the District Judge ordered him to answer, Arndstein was committed for contempt. He did not appeal from the order or file a petition to revise. Instead he applied to another judge sitting in the same court for a writ of habeas corpus. The petition was denied, on the ground that the bankrupt had \n\n[266 U.S. 34, 39]\n\u00a0\n waived his privilege by complying without objection to the order that he file a schedule of his assets. \n1\n The judgment denying the writ was reversed by this court, but the mandate required merely that the lower court issue the writ and then proceed as usual. Arndstein v. McCarthy, \n254 \nU.S. 71\n, 41 S. Ct. 136; Id., \n254 \nU.S. 379\n, 41 S. Ct. 136.\n Thereupon the District Court issued the writ of habeas corpus. The marshal made a return which included a transcript of the entire proceedings. The court held that, despite certain oral answers given, the bankrupt was entitled to cease disclosure. The judgment, which discharged the bankrupt from custody, was affirmed by this court. McCarthy v. Arndstein, \n262 \nU.S. 355, 357\n, 358 S., 43 S. Ct. 562. The case is not before us on rehearing, granted in order to permit argument of the proposition, not presented by counsel before, that the privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to an examination of the bankrupt made for the purpose of obtaining possession of property belonging to his estate. \n263 \nU.S. 676\n, 44 S. Ct. 33.\n The right to examine the bankrupt, here in question, rests wholly on section 21a. This section provides that the court may 'require any designated person, including the bankrupt and his wife, to appear in court ... to be examined concerning the acts, conduct, or property of a bankrupt whose estate is in process of administration. ...' The subject- matter of the examination is thus specifically prescribed by the act. There is no provision prescribing the rules by which the examination is to be governed. These are, impliedly, the general rules governing the admissibility of evidence and the competency and compellability of witnesses. \n2\n The section contains no in \n\n[266 U.S. 34, 40]\n\u00a0\n dication of an intention, on the part of Congress, to take from any witness the privilege against self-incrimination. Moreover, the section makes clear the purpose not to differentiate between the bankrupt and other witnesses, nor to differentiate examinations which relate to the property from those which relate to the acts or the conduct of the bankrupt. \n3\n This court has already decided that the privilege was not waived, either by the bankrupt's filing the schedule or by his answering orally certain questions. The contention now is that the privilege against self-incrimination ought to have been disallowed because, under the Constitution, it does not extend to the examination of a bankrupt in a bankruptcy proceeding.\n The government insists, broadly, that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination does not apply in any civil proceeding. The contrary must be accepted as settled. The privilege is not ordinarily dependent upon the nature of the proceeding in which the testimony is sought or is to be used. It applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it. The privilege protects a mere witness as fully as it does one who is also a party defendant. It protects, likewise, the owner of goods which may be forfeited in a penal proceeding. See Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547, 563\n, 564 S., 12 S. Ct. 195\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 34, 41]\n\u00a0\n The government urges more strongly a narrower contention. It claims that the constitutional privilege does not relieve a bankrupt from the duty to give information which is sought for the purpose of discovering his estate. It asserts that in England such an exception to the common law privi lege prevails, and that the exception had been established there prior to the Declaration of Independence. \n4\n Whatever may be the rule in England, it is clear that in America the constitutional prohibition of compulsory self-incrimination has not been so limited. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The cases which hold that a bankrupt must surrender books and papers, although they contain incriminating evidence, rest upon a principle different from that here involved. Matter of Harris, \n221 \nU.S. 274\n, 31 S. Ct. 557; Johnson v. United States, \n228 \nU.S. 457\n, 33 S. Ct. 572, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 263; Ex parte Fuller, \n262 \nU.S. 91\n, 43 S. Ct. 496; Dier v. Banton, \n262 \nU.S. 147\n, 43 S. Ct. 533. The law requires a bankrupt to surrender his property. The books and papers of a business are a part of the bankrupt estate. Section 70a(1) being Comp. St.  9654. To permit him to retain possession, because surrender might involve disclosure of a crime, would destroy a property right. The constitutional privilege relates to the adjective law. It does not relieve one from compliance with the substantive obligation to surrender property. \n\n[266 U.S. 34, 42]\n\u00a0\n Section 21a, on the other hand, deals specifically and solely with the adjective law-with evidence and witnesses. When the bankrupt appears before a commissioner under this section, he comes, like any other person, merely to testify. In that connection he may, like any other witness, assert the constitutional privilege; because the present statute fails to afford complete immunity from prosecution. If Congress should hereafter conclude that a full disclosure of the bankrupt estate by the witnesses is of greater importance than the possibility of punishing them for some crime in the past, it can, as in other cases, confer the power of unrestricted examination by providing complete immunity. Compare Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591\n, 16 S. Ct. 644; Glickstein v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 139, 142\n, 32 S. Ct. 71; Ensign v. Pennsylvania, \n227 \nU.S. 592\n, 33 S.

U.S.(1924)\nNo. 135\nArgued: Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 484, 485]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Elmer E. Grinstead, of Pawhuska, Okl., for appellants.\n The Attorney General and Mr. S. W. Williams, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States, as guardian and trustee for the Osage Indians, brought this suit against the county treasurer and taxing officers of Osage county, Okl., and others, to restrain collection of unpaid taxes, to cancel certain tax sale certificates, and to recover sums paid as taxes on land in that county, which had been allotted to members of the Osage Tribe. The District Court dismissed the cause. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree, and remanded the cause, with instructions to grant the relief prayed.\n The question is whether the allotted lands were subject to taxation for 1909. Under the state laws, land was taxable as of March 1 of that year. In 1883, these lands were purchased from the Cherokee Nation by the United States for the benefit of the Osage and Kansas Indians. Chapter 3572, 34 Stat. 539, approved June 28, 1906, known as the Osage Allotment Act, provided for the division of lands belonging to the Osage Tribe among its \n\n[264 U.S. 484, 486]\n\u00a0\n members. Section 2. Each member was entitled to make three selections, and was permitted to designate one as a homestead, which was required to be so designated in his certificate and deed, and it was provided that the homestead would be inalienable and nontaxable until otherwise provided by act of Congress. The other land allotted to each member was known as surplus land. Subdivision 4,  2. The Secretary of the Interior, in his discretion and upon the petition of any adult member of the tribe, was empowered to issue to such member a certificate of competency, authorizing him to sell and convey any of the lands 'deeded him by reason of this act.' It was provided that:\n'The surplus lands shall be nontaxable for the period of three years from the approval of this act, except where certificates of competency are issued or in case of the death of the allottee, unless otherwise provided by Congress.' Subdivision 7,  2.\n\n Further, that the lands of any deceased members should descend to his or her legal heirs according to the laws of Oklahoma, except in certain cases not here material (section 6), and that:\n'All deeds ... shall be executed by the principal chief for the Osages, but no such deeds shall be valid until approved by the Secretary of the Interior.' Section 8.\n\n The allotments were completed and approved by the Secretary November 19, 1908. All allottees had died prior to that date. All of the lands taxed were allotted as surplus lands. Deeds were not signed by the principal chief until May and June, 1909, and they were not approved by the Secretary until July 30 of that year. None of the allottees received a certificate of competency.\n Title was in the United States on the date as of which the assessment was made, and did not pass until the execution and delivery of the deeds. Section 8. The lands were not taxable while held in trust by the United States. United States v. Rickert, \n188 U.S. 432\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 478; See also The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737; Oklahoma Enabling Act, 34 \n\n[264 U.S. 484, 487]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 267,  1, c. 3335, approved June 16, 1906; Oklahoma Constitution, art. 1,  3, and article 10,  6.\n The death of the allottees before completion of the allotment did not make the lands taxable as of March 1, 1909. The allotment was made about 2 1\/2 years after the approval of the act and after and death of all of the allottees. The 3-year provision applies to surplus and not to homestead lands. This classification depends on selection and designation by the allotee, to be evidenced in the certificates of allotment and the deeds. It was impossible to ascertain as of March 1, 1909, what lands were surplus.\n Appellants suggest that the title which passed at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed should be held to relate back and take effect at the time of the completion of the allotments. The doctrine of relation gives effect to an act done at one time as if it had been done at another. It is a legal fiction adopted by courts solely for purposes of justice-to avoid denial or loss of right, but not to impose burdens. Its application depends on some antecedent right. Gibson v. Chouteau, 13 Wall, 92, 100; Lykins v. McGrath, \n184 U.S. 169\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 450; United States v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. (C. C.) 142 Fed. 176, 187; Powers v. Hurmert, 51 Mo. 136. There is nothing in the Osage Enrollment Act, or in the situation, requiring application of the doctrine of relation against the Indians. The provision empowering the Secretary of the Interior to issue certificates authorizing members found to be competent and capable to sell and convey the 'lands deeded' makes ownership and right to sell depend on the deeds. If, on execution and delivery of deeds, title shall be deemed to have passed prior to March 1, 1909, while in fact the land was held in trust by the United States, the lands will be burdened with taxes, which otherwise they would not be subject to. We hold that the doctrine of relation should not be applied.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCMILLAN CONTRACTING CO. v. ABERNATHY(1924)\nNo. 167\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1924\n\n\n\n Messrs. Justin D. Bowersock and Arthur Miller, both of Kansas City, Mo., for appellants. \n\n[263 U.S. 438, 439]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. O. H. Dean, H. M. Langworthy, Roy B. Thomson, M. W. Borders, and Albert S. Marley, all of Kansas City, Mo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These were two bills in equity in the United States District Court, brought by citizens of Missouri to enjoin citizens of the same state from proceeding to collect special assessments, of the necessary jurisdictional amount in each case, against complainants' lands in Kansas City for a public improvement, on the ground that the city charter and laws under which the assessments were levied were in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution. This was the only basis for the jurisdiction of the District Court. The bills also averred that the assessments did not comply with the laws under which they purported to be levied. The defendants in their answers, in addition to a denial of the averments upon which the relief was asked, pleaded a former adjudication of the same causes of action in a Missouri state court.\n The District Court held with the complainants that the charter and laws as carried out in levying the assessments violated the Fourteenth Amendment, overruled the plea of res judicata and granted the injunction as prayed. Appeals were perfected to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellees moved to dismiss the appeals. They contended that the jurisdiction of the appeals was exclusively in this court. The Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with them in this, but declined to dismiss the \n\n[263 U.S. 438, 440]\n\u00a0\n appeals, because of an act of Congress approved September 14, 1922 (42 Stat. 837, c. 305), amending section 238 by adding a new section 238a ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1215a), in part as follows:\n'If an appeal or writ of error has been or shall be taken to, or issued out of, any Circuit Court of Appeals in a case wherein such appeal or writ of error should have been taken to or issued out of the Supreme Court, ... such appeal or writ of error shall not for such reason be dismissed, but shall be transferred to the proper court, which shall thereupon be possessed of the same and shall proceed to the determination thereof, with the same force and effect as if such appeal or writ of error had been duly taken to, or issued out of, the court to which it is so transferred.'\n\n An order was accordingly made transferring the appeals to this court. The final decrees of the District Court were entered of record July 7, 1921. The three months in which an appeal could have been taken from that court to this expired on the following October 7. 39 Stat. 727, c. 448,  6 (Comp. St.  1228a). The appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals were allowed January 4, 1922\n\n\n The appellants move to remand the appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals, with direction to consider them on their merits. The appellees insist that the new section 238a does not apply to the appeals, that they were improperly transferred, and should be remanded with instructions to dismiss.\n Two questions are thus presented for our decision:\n\n\n (1)\n Did the Circuit Court of Appeals have jurisdiction of the appeals?\n\n\n (2)\n If not, should it have dismissed them, instead of transferring them to this court?\n First. The Circuit Courts of Appeals were created by the act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 826, c. 517). The division of the appellate business between the new courts and this court was originally provided for in sections 5 and 6 of \n\n[263 U.S. 438, 441]\n\u00a0\n that act. Their substance, with amendments not here material, is now embodied in sections 238, 128, 239, 240, and 241 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1215, 1120, 1216-1218). Section 238 provides for direct appeals from the District Court to this court in certified questions of jurisdiction of the District Court, in prize cases, and in all cases in which federal constitutional or treaty questions are involved. Section 128 gives the Circuit Courts of Appeals appellate jurisdiction in all cases other than those in which direct appeals may be taken to this court under section 238, 'unless otherwise provided by law.' Except where, under section 239, a question may be certified to this court by a Circuit Court of Appeals, or when, under section 240, this court may bring up a case from the Circuit Court of Appeals by certiorari, the judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals in cases in which jurisdiction of the District Court is dependent entirely on the diverse citizenship of the parties, in patent and copyright cases, in revenue cases, in criminal cases, and in admiralty cases, are made final by section 128. Certain other cases specified in the act of January 28, 1915 (38 Stat. 803,  2), amending section 128, and in the act of September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. 726,  3 [Comp. St.  1120a]), are also made final in the Circuit Court of Appeal. Judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals not thus made final, and in which more than $1,000 is involved, may be appealed to this court under section 241.\n The act of 1891 was passed to relieve this court from a discouraging congestion of business. It was evidently intended that the Circuit Court of Appeals should do a large part of the appellate business. The act was not happily drawn, in defining the division of it between those courts and this court, and many difficulties have arisen. It suffices here to say that under an unbroken line of authorities, when the plaintiff invokes the jurisdiction of the federal District Court on the sole ground that this case is one in which a substantial federal constitutional \n\n[263 U.S. 438, 442]\n\u00a0\n or treaty question arises, this court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction thereof under section 238. American Refining Co. v. New Orleans, \n181 \nU.S. 277, 281\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 646; Huguley Mfg. Co. v. Galeton Cotton Mills, \n184 \nU.S. 290, 295\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 452; Union & Planters' Bank v. Memphis, \n189 \nU.S. 71, 73\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 604; Spreckels Sugar Refining Company v. McClain, \n192 \nU.S. 397, 407\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 376; Carolina Glass Co. v. South Carolina, \n240 \nU.S. 305, 318\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 293; Raton Water Works Co. v. Raton, \n240 \nU.S. 552, 553\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 384; Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Company, \n258 \nU.S. 50, 52\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 244.\n It is said that there were two other questions involved in these present cases in the District Court in addition to the federal constitutional question-one of conformity of the assessments to the city charter and state law, and the other of res judicata. But they were not federal questions, upon which the jurisdiction of the federal trial court could rest, and therefore could furnish no ground for appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals under section 128 or other provision of law. To avoid the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of this court over such an appeal in constitutional or treaty questions under section 238, there must be diversity of citizenship of the parties, or the other questions involved must be federal and adequate themselves to support the original jurisdiction. This was expressly ruled in Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Company, \n258 \nU.S. 50, 53\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 244; s. c., sub nomine Farmers' Grain Co. v. Langer (C. C. A.) 273 Fed. 635, 19 A. L. R. 148; and obviously follows from the decisions in Lovell v. Newman, \n227 U.S. 412\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 375; City of Pomona v. Sunset Telephone Co., \n224 U.S. 330\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 477, and Spreckels Sugar Refining Company v. McClain, \n192 U.S. 397\n, 407.\n We conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction of the appeals in these cases, and that they should have been dismissed, unless the act of September 14, 1922, required that court to transfer them.\n Second. When the act of September 14, 1922, was passed, the three months allowed for appeals to this court in these cases had expired. Appellees urge that, even if \n\n[263 U.S. 438, 443]\n\u00a0\n the act in terms must be held to apply to these cases, it would be beyond the power of Congress thus to deprive the appellees of their property in the decrees which had vested when the three months had expired.\n We do not find it necessary to consider this question, or the kindred one whether the act of 1922 ought to be construed to be prospective, and so not to include these appeals. We prefer to put our conclusion on a construction of the act which shall have general application, and of which all litigants may have early notice. The time allowed by law for appeals from the District Court to the Circuit Courts of Appeals is in general six months (section 11, Act of March 3, 1891, 27 Stat. 826, 829, c. 517 [Comp. St.  1647]), or double that allowed for appeals to this court. We do not think the act of 1922 applies to any case in which the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals is taken after the period for appeals to this court has expired. Otherwise the act will enable one, who negligently has allowed his right of appeal to this court to go by, to take his appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and by transfer get into this court, and thus lengthen the time for direct appeals to this court from three to six months. This result we cannot assume Congress intended.\n As the appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals were not taken within three months after the decrees appealed from were entered, that court had no power to order a transfer to this court.\n The cases are therefore remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMEEK v. CENTRE COUNTY BANKING CO(1924)\nNo. 590\nArgued: March 13, 1924Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 499, 500]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Mortimer C. Rhone, of Williamsport, Pa., and Ellis L. Orvis and Harry Keller, both of Bellefonte, Pa., for petitioners.\n Messrs. S. D. Gettig and N. B. Spangler, both of Bellefonte, Pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These three cases-which were heard together in the Circuit Court of Appeals and are included here in one record-arose out of a petition in bankruptcy filed by the respondent Shugert in a federal District Court in Pennsylvania. In this petition he alleged that he and the present petitioners, Meek, Dale and Breeze-hereafter called the defendants-were members of a partnership styled the Centre County Banking Company; that the partnership and each of the defendants were insolvent; and that he and the partnership desired to obtain the benefits of the bankruptcy law. He prayed that the partnership and he and the defendants individually be adjudged bankrupt. \n1\n Subpoenas were issued for the defendants. All appeared and resisted the petition in so far as it sought to have the partnership and themselves \n\n[264 U.S. 499, 501]\n\u00a0\n adjudged bankrupt;2 and each made a motion to dismiss the petition to that extent upon the grounds, among others, that it was not authorized by the Bankruptcy Act and the court had no jurisdiction under it to adjudge either the partnership or a nonconsenting member bankrupt. These motions were denied by the District Court. On petitions by the defendants to revise the orders of the District Court denying their motion, the Circuit Court of Appeals, being of opinion that the petition in bankruptcy was maintainable under section 5 of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9589) and General Order in Bankruptcy No. 8,3 affirmed the orders of the District Court. 292 Fed. 116. These writs of certiorari were then granted the defendants. \n263 U.S. 696\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 39, 68 L. Ed. --.\n Shugert thereafter died. And the defendants have moved that the proceeding in bankruptcy be dismissed as to them, both individually and as members of the partnership, on the ground that to that extent it should abate. These motions have been answered by the attorney who formerly represented Shugert, as now representing his 'interest,' and by an attorney representing a 'Creditors' Committee,' who insists that under section 8 of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9592) the proceeding in bankruptcy was not abated by Shugert's death and may be continued without making Shugert's personal representative a party. While neither of these attorneys represents any party now before \n\n[264 U.S. 499, 502]\n\u00a0\n the court,4 we treat their answer as the suggestion of amici curiae.\n Section 8 of the Bankruptcy Act provides that:\n'The death ... of a bankrupt shall not abate the proceedings, but the same shall be conducted and concluded in the same manner, so far as possible, as though he had not died.'\n\n It is clear, however, that, whatever may be the effect of this provision, when construed in the light of section 1a(4) of the Act (Comp. St.  9585) defining the term 'bankrupt,' it can have no application except to that part of the petition in bankruptcy in which Shugert sought to have himself adjudged a voluntary bankrupt-a matter not in issue under the motions to dismiss and not now before us. Even if one partner may maintain a petition such as this to have the partnership adjudicated a bankrupt-a question not now determined-yet to the extent that it seeks to have the partnership adjudged bankrupt as against non-consenting partners resisting such an adjudication, it is, manifestly, an involuntary proceeding. In re Murray (D. C.) 96 Fed. 600, 602. And see In re Carleton ( D. C.) 115 Fed. 246, 249. In Medsker v. Bonebrake, \n108 \nU.S. 66, 71\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 351, 353 (27 L. Ed. 654), involving a bankruptcy proceeding brought by one partner against another under the Act of 1867 (14 Stat. 517), this Court said:\n'It is not a voluntary bankruptcy if the man is forced into it against his will by his partner, any more than by anyone else; and it is compulsory and involuntary if he refuses to join in such case and is forced into it, as much as in any other enforced bankruptcy.'\n\n And, a fortiori, such a petition as this is an involuntary proceeding to the extent that it also seeks to have the non-consenting partnership adjudged bankrupt as individuals.\n In other words, in so far as Shugert's petition sought not merely to have the partnership adjudged bankrupt as \n\n[264 U.S. 499, 503]\n\u00a0\n against the defendants, but also to have them adjudged as individuals, it was clearly an antagonistic proceeding. To that extent Shugert was not the 'bankrupt,' but stood in a position analogous to that of a creditor seeking the involuntary adjudication of his debtor. Even in so far as the petition sought to have the partnership adjudged bankrupt, the defendants, as non-consenting partners, were entitled, under the specific provision of General Order No. 8, to make defense 'in the same manner as if the petition had been filed by a creditor of the partnership.' Note 3, supra. Such a proceeding, as any other litigated matter, requires adversary parties; and manifestly, in the very nature of things, can only be continued as long as there are adversary parties. In the proceeding in the District Court and in the Circuit Court of Appeals Shugert was the petitioner in the bankruptcy proceeding, affirmatively seeking relief against his partners by subjecting their property to the payment of the partnership debts, and actively engaged in the prosecution of his petition against them. As the cases now stand, however, by reason of his death there is no longer any petitioner seeking the bankruptcy of the firm or of the defendants; no adversary party in so far as the defendants are concerned.\n The question whether Shugert's right to maintain the petition in bankruptcy for the purpose of having the partnership and the defendants adjudged bankrupt-if any he had-is one which abated with his death, or one which survives to his proper representatives in the personalty or realty involved so that the bankruptcy proceeding may be continued in their names, is not, however, free from difficulty. It is, so far as we are advised, one of first impression. And it is one which we think should not be determined ex parte, if there are any persons claiming to be proper representatives of his interest in the proceeding \n\n[264 U.S. 499, 504]\n\u00a0\n who desire to be admitted as parties for the purpose of continuing it in his stead.\n Under the circumstances we conclude that we should now deny the motions to dismiss the proceeding; with leave to any persons claiming to be the proper representatives of Shugert's interest to appear in this court within thirty days from this date, setting forth the capacity in which they so claim, and applying for leave to be admitted as parties for the purpose of continuing the proceeding. If this is done the question whether the proceeding should be dismissed as to the partnership and the defendants or continued as to them by such representatives, will then be determined. But if no one thus appears, these cases will be remanded with instructions to dismiss the proceeding in so far as the petition seeks to have the partnership and the defendants adjudged bankrupt; following, by analogy, the practice established in cases that have become moot. Heitmuller v. Stokes, \n256 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 522; Harlan v. Harlan, \n263 U.S. 681\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 135, 68 L. Ed. --.\n The attorneys who filed the answer to the defendants' motions will forthwith give notice of this ruling to the representatives of Shugert's interest in the property involved, and also to not less than three creditors of the partnership; and will, within such thirty days, file with the clerk of this court a verified return showing to whom such notices were given.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The petition combined a 'debtors' petition' (Form No. 1), a 'partnership petition' (Form No. 2), and a petition against the defendants individually. There was no allegation that either the partnership or the defendants had committed an act of bankruptcy. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Two of them denied that they were members of the partnership. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 5 of the Act provides that 'a partnership ... may be adjudged a bankrupt.'\n General Order No. 8 provides that: 'Any member of a partnership, who refuses to join in a petition to have the partnership declared bankrupt, shall be entitled to resist the prayer of the petition in the same manner as if the petition had been filed by a creditor of the partnership, and notice of the filing of the petition shall be given to him in the same manner as ... in the case of a debtor petitioned against; and he shall have the right to appear ... and to make all defences which any debtor proceeded against is entitled to take by the provisions of the act.' \n210 U.S. 570\n, Append. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The record does not show that any creditor appeared in the proceeding in the District Court. \n\n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMELLON v. ORINOCO IRON CO(1924)\nNo. 491\nArgued: Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 121, 122]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. R. Harr and Edward S. Duvall, both of Washington, D. C., for the motion.\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., opposed.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The subject of this suit is $56,250, now in the Treasury of the United States, which is the undistributed balance of an indemnity of $385, 000 received by the Secretary of State from Venezuela. This was in satisfaction of the claim of the Orinoco Company, Limited, hereafter known as the Limited Company, against Venezuela because of her illegal annulment of the so-called Fitzgerald concession, which by mesne transfers from the original concessionaire had vested in the Limited Company and of her ouster of that company. The appellee, the Orinoco Iron Company, was the lessee of the Limited Company of mining rights in the concession covering the remainder of the term of the concession, and was in possession of them at the time of the ouster. The Iron Company had engaged actively in mining operations and had expended $175,000 in exploiting and operating the mines when its property and rights were thus confiscated.\n At the instance of the Limited Company, our Department of State made the claim against Venezuela for the injuries sustained, and finally a protocol was signed between the two countries whereby Venezuela agreed to pay and did pay $385,000 to the United States.\n By Act of February 27, 1896, chapter 34, 29 Stat. 28, 32 (Comp. St.  6668), it is provided as follows: \n\n[266 U.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n 'Hereafter all moneys received by the Secretary of State from foreign governments and other sources, in trust for citizens of the United States or others, shall be deposited and covered into the Treasury.\n'The Secretary of State shall determine the amounts due claimants, respectively, from each of such trust funds, and certify the same to the Secretary of the Treasury, who shall, upon the presentation of the certificates of the Secretary of State, pay the amounts so found to be due.\n\n'Each of the trust funds covered into the Treasury as aforesaid is hereby appropriated for the payment to the ascertained beneficiaries thereof of the certificates herein provided for.'\n\n After the payment was made into the Treasury of the United States, a controversy arose between the receiver of the Limited Company, who had meantime been appointed by a Minnesota state court, and the Orinoco Iron Company, the present appellee, as to who was entitled to the fund and the latter sought to have the payment ordered made to it. The Secretary of State, in a letter to the counsel of the Orinoco Iron Company said in answer:\n'I desire to say that the Department of State, in making its determination as to the distribution of awards or settlements of international claims, is always guided by certain fundamental rules, which may be roughly stated as follows:\n\n'The awards are distributed among the original claimants showing themselves entitled thereto, or to the heirs, representatives, devisees, or legal assignees of such claimants. On occasion the department also makes payments to such other persons in such amounts as the parties above indicated, being determined, shall agreed and direct. Except as to such claimants claiming to share in the award as claimants, or their heirs, devisees, representatives, or legal assignees claiming to share in the award by \n\n[266 U.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n reason of such relationship to such claimants, all parties who allege claims against the fund itself, as also all creditors of such claimants, or of their heirs, devisees, representatives, or legal assignees, are in accordance with the uniform rule and practice of the department remitted to the courts for the enforcement of the rights of which they consider themselves possessed, or to private agreement with the parties in interest-as they may be advised.'\n\n The Secretary of State accordingly directed the payment of the money to the Limited Company and to other persons designated by it, and sent proper certificates to the Secretary of the Treasury for such distribution.\n The Orinoco Iron Company then filed this bill in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to restrain the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States from paying the fund still remaining in the Treasury to the Limited Company and its receiver Le Crone in accordance with the certificate of the Secretary of State, and asked that a receiver be appointed to receive the fund while the right of the complainant to appropriate the fund to its claim should be litigated. The Limited Company and its receiver were made parties, and the issue between the complainant and the Limited Company, with respect to this fund was heard and decided in favor of the complainant and present appellee. Both the Supreme Court of the District and the Court of Appeals found that at least $175,000 of the $385,000 of the award was based upon the contributions which the Orinoco Iron Company had made in execution of its contract to work the iron mines of the concession, and that the Limited Company in ignoring and denying all rights of the Orinoco Iron Company to share in the fund had been guilty of fraud in appropriating that which was the equitable interest of the Orinoco Iron Company. Accordingly the injunction was made permanent, a receiver \n\n[266 U.S. 121, 125]\n\u00a0\n was appointed, and the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to pay the $ 56,250 to that receiver, who was authorized to execute a full acquittance of the United States as from the parties to the suit.\n This is an appeal by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States to which the Orinoco Company, Limited, and its receiver are not parties. They took a separate appeal which was dismissed last term. Orinoco Co. v. Orinoco Iron Co., \n265 \nU.S. 598\n, 44 S. Ct. 461. The question raised on this appeal therefore does not involve the merits of the controversy between the Orinoco Iron Company, the appellee, and the Orinoco Company, Limited, and its receiver. We must assume here, therefore, that in attempting to take over and deny to the Orinoco Iron Company the equitable interest of that company, the Orinoco Company, Limited, and its receiver are as to the Iron Company in the position of a trustee ex maleficio.\n It is contended, on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury, that his duty in this regard is entirely ministerial, that he must carry out the behest of the Secretary of State, who is charged by law with determining who the proper claimants are, and therefore that after the decision of the Secretary of State, no court may interfere between the payment by the Secretary of the Treasury to the claimant found to be entitled. We consider this question to be already settled by the decision of this court against the government contention.\n In Houston, Secretary of the Treasury, v. Ormes, \n252 \nU.S. 469\n, 40 S. Ct. 369, Congress had appropriated $1,200 to pay a claim found by the Court of Claims to be due to one Susan Sanders. This was a suit brought by one who claimed an equitable lien for attorney's fees upon the amount thus appropriated, to enjoin the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States from paying the amount due on that lien to the person named in the appropriation, and to require them to pay the sum claimed to a receiver in the \n\n[266 U.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n suit pending the hearing and to accept the receipt of the receiver as in full acquittance of the government from the parties to the suit for the amount paid him. The court in that case said (page 473 [40 S. Ct. 370]):\n'In the present case it is conceded, and properly conceded, that payment of the fund in question to the defendant Sanders is a ministerial duty, the performance of which could be compelled by mandamus. But from this it is a necessary consequence that one who has an equitable right in the fund as against Sanders may have relief against the officials of the Treasury through a mandatory writ of injunction, or a receivership which is its equivalent, making Sanders a party so as to bind her and so that the decree may afford a proper acquittance to the government. The practice of bringing suits in equity for this purpose is well established in the courts of the District. Sanborn v. Maxwell, 18 App. D. C. 245; Rovers v. Consaul, 24 App. D. C. 551, 563; Jones v. Rutherford, 26 App. D. C. 114; Parish v. McGowan, 39 App. D. C. 184; s. c. on appeal, McGowan v. Parish, \n237 U.S. 285\n, 295. Confined, as it necessarily must be, to cases where the officials of the government have only a ministerial duty to perform, and one in which the party complainant has a particular interest, the practice is a convenient one, well supported by both principle and precedent.\n\n It seems to us that the present case can not be distinguished from the one cited. It is conceded by the government that the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury is ministerial and is to pay the amount ordered distributed by the Secretary of State to the persons named in his certificate. Certainly the action of the Secretary of the Treasury, in obedience to an appropriation by Congress, is neither more nor less of a ministerial duty than the obligation of the Secretary of the Treasury in the case at bar to act in compliance with the direction of \n\n[266 U.S. 121, 127]\n\u00a0\n the Secretary of State. This case is here on a motion to dismiss or affirm. The decree of the Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMICHAELSON v. U. S. EX REL. CHICAGO, ST.

Kennedy, of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent Chicago, St. P., M. & O. R. Co.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 42, 62]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases were argued together and will be disposed of in one opinion. The principal question presented in the Michaelson Case, and the sole question in the Sandefur Case, is whether the provision of the Clayton Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 738,  21, 22 (Comp. St .  1245a, 1245b), requiring a jury trial in certain specified kinds of contempt \n\n[266 U.S. 42, 63]\n\u00a0\n is constitutional. Subordinate questions presented in the Michaelson Case are: (a) Whether petitioners were, or whether it is necessary that they should be, 'employees' within the meaning of section 20 of the act (Comp. St.  1243d); (b) whether the acts alleged to constitute the contempt were also criminal offenses under the statutes of the United States or of the state where committed; (c) whether the provision for a jury is mandatory or permissive.\n The petitioners in the Michaelson Case were striking employees of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railway Company, and, with others, were proceeded against by bill in equity for combining and conspiring to interfere with interstate commerce by picketing and the use of force and violence, etc. After a hearing, a preliminary injunction was granted. Subsequently proceedings in contempt were instituted in the District Court, charging petitioners with sundry violations of the injunction, and a rule to show cause was issued. Upon the answer and return to the rule, petitioners applied for a jury trial under section 22 of the Clayton Act; but the District Court denied the application and proceeded without a jury. At the conclusion of the hearing, the petitioners were adjudged guilty and sentenced to pay fines in various sums, and in default of payment to stand committed to jail until such fines were paid. Thereupon the case was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals by writ of error, and by that court the judgments were affirmed. 291 F. 940.\n First. Is the provision of the Clayton Act, granting a right of trial by jury, constitutional? The court below held in the negative, on the ground that the power of a court to vindicate or enforce its decree in equity is inherent, is derived from the Constitution as a part of its judicial power, and that Congress is without constitutional authority to deprive the parties in an equity court of the right of trial by the chancellor. \n\n[266 U.S. 42, 64]\n\u00a0\n If the statute now under review encroaches upon the equity jurisdiction intended by the Constitution, a grave constitutional question in respect of its validity would be presented; and it therefore becomes our duty, as this court has frequently said, to construe it, 'if fairly possible, so as to avoid, not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score.' Panama Railroad Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375\n, 44 S. Ct. 391.\n Shortly stated, the statute provides that willful disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of any District Court of the United States or any court of the District of Columbia by doing any act or thing forbidden, if such act or thing be of such character as to constitute also a criminal offense under any statute of the United States or law of any state in which the act is committed, shall be proceeded against as in the statute provided. In all such cases the 'trial may be by the court, or, upon demand of the accused, by a jury' and 'such trial shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice in criminal cases prosecuted by indictment or upon information.' Upon conviction the accused is to be punished 'by fine or imprisonment, or both,' the fine to be 'paid to the United States or to the complainant or other party injured by the act constituting the contempt, or may, where more than one is so damaged, be divided or apportioned among them as the court may direct.'\n The provision for trial by jury upon demand, as we shall presently show, is mandatory, and the question to be answered is whether it infringes any power of the courts vested by the Constitution and unalterable by congressional legislation. We first inquire whether the proceeding contemplated by the statute is for a civil or a criminal contempt. If it be the latter-since the proceeding for criminal contempt, unlike that for civil contempt, is between the public and the defendant, is an independent proceeding at law, and no part of the original cause \n\n[266 U.S. 42, 65]\n\u00a0\n (Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 U.S. 418\n, 444-446, 451, 31 S. Ct. 492, 34 L. R. A. [N. S.] 874)-we are at once relieved of the doubt which might otherwise arise in respect of the authority of Congress to set aside the settled rule that a suit in equity is to be tried by the chancellor without a jury unless he choose to call one as purely advisory, We think the statute, reasonably construed, relates exclusively to criminal contempts. The act or thing charged must be of such character as also to constitute a crime. Prosecution must be in conformity with the practice in criminal cases. Upon conviction the accused is to be punished by fine or imprisonment, or both. True, the fine may be paid to the United States or to the complainant or divided among the parties injured by the act, as the court may direct; but that does not alter the essential nature of the proceeding contemplated by the statute. The discretion given the court in this respect is incidental and subordinate to the dominating purpose of the proceeding which is punitive to vindicate the authority of the court and punish the act of disobedience as a public wrong. See Re Merchants Stock Co., Petitioner, \n223 \nU.S. 639, 641\n, 32 S. Ct. 339; Matter of Christenson Engineering Co., \n194 \nU.S. 458, 461\n, 24 S. Ct. 729; Merchants' Stock & Grain Co. v. Board of Trade, 187 F. 398, 401, 109 C. C. A. 230, Kreplik v. Couch Patents Co., 190 F. 565, 572, 111 C. C. A. 381. 'If the contempt savors of criminality, and the sentence is penal, that according to the books appears to be enough.' Long Wellesley's Case, 2 Russ. & M. 639, 667.\n But it is contended that the statute materially interferes with the inherent power of the courts and is therefore invalid. That the power to punish for contempts is inherent in all courts, has been many times decided and may be regarded as settled law. It is essential to the administration of justice. The courts of the United States, when called into existence and vested with jurisdiction \n\n[266 U.S. 42, 66]\n\u00a0\n over and subject, at once become possessed of the power. So far as the inferior federal courts are concerned, however, it is not beyond the authority of Congress (Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 510-511; Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co., \n194 \nU.S. 324, 326\n, 24 S. Ct. 665); but the attributes which inhere in that power and are inseparable from it can neither be abrogated nor rendered practically inoperative. That it may be regulated within limits not precisely defined may not be doubted. The statute now under review is of the latter character. It is of narrow scope, dealing with the single class where the act or thing constituting the contempt is also a crime in the ordinary sense. It does not interfere with the power to deal summarily with contempts committed in the presence of the court or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, and is in express terms cerefully limited to the cases of contempt specifically defined. Neither do we think it purports to reach cases of failure or refusal to comply affirmatively with a decree-that is to do something which a decree commands-which may be enforced by coercive means or remedied by purely compensatory relief. If the reach of the statute had extended to the cases which are excluded a different and more serious question would arise. But the simple question presented is whether Congress may require a trial by jury upon the demand of the accused in an independent proceeding at law for a criminal contempt which is also a crime. In criminal contempts, as in criminal cases, the presumption of innocence obtains. Proof of guilt must be beyond reasonable doubt and the defendant may not be compelled to be a witness against himself, Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., supra, p. 444 (31 S. Ct. 492 .) The fundamental characteristics of both are the same. Contempts of the kind within the terms of the statute partake of the nature of crimes in all essential particulars. 'So truly are they crimes that it seems to be proved that in the early law they were \n\n[266 U.S. 42, 67]\n\u00a0\n punished only by the usual criminal procedure, 3 Transactions of the Royal Historical Society (N. S.) p. 147 (1885), and that at least in England it seems that they still may be and preferably are tried in that way.' Gompers v. United States, \n233 U.S. 604\n, 610-611, 34 S. Ct. 693, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 1044. This is also pointed out by counsel in the case of O'Shea v. O'Shea and Parnell, L. R. 15 Prob. Div. 50, 61; and, in the course of one of the opinions in that case, it is said (page 64):\n'The offense of appellant [criminal contempt] is certainly a criminal offense. I do not say that it is an indictable offense, but, whether indictable or not, it is a criminal offense, and it is an offense, and the only offense that I know of, which is punishable at common law by summary process.'\n\n The proceeding is not between the parties to the original suit but between the public and the defendant. The only substantial difference between such a proceeding as we have here, and a criminal prosecution by indictment or information is that in the latter the act complained of is the violation of a law and in the former the violation of a decree. In the case of the latter, the accused has a constitutional right of trial by jury; while in the former he has not. The statutory extension of this constitutional right to a class of contempts which are properly described as 'criminal offenses' does not, in our opinion, invade the powers of the courts as intended by the Constitution or violate that instrument in any other way.\n Second. We come, then, to consider the reasons which, assuming the validity of the statute, are nevertheless urged to preclude the right to a jury trial. The first contention is that petitioners were not 'employees' within the meaning of the act, because, having gone out on strike, the relationship of employer and employee had come to an end. The dispute out of which arose the unlawful acts alleged in the bill was one between the employer on the one hand and its employees on the other, respecting terms \n\n[266 U.S. 42, 68]\n\u00a0\n or conditions of employment, namely, the scale of wages to be paid employees of the class to which defendants belonged. This dispute had been submitted to the Railroad Labor Board, which, after a hearing, had fixed the scale to be paid; but the defendants declined to abide by the action of the board and went out on strike, and in furtherance thereof conspired together and committed various unlawful acts in restraint of respondent's interstate commerce. The purpose of the strike was to bring about an increase of wages. The case was obviously within the provisions of section 20, in respect of injunctions. The court below held that, while ordinarily this would be so, it was not so in this instance, because (1) the employer was a railroad company bound to continue its operations in the public interest and therefore not on an equal footing with its employees; and (2) that, since the scale of wages had been fixed by the Railroad Labor Board, the strike, in effect, was against the board, a governmental instrumentality, 'to be classed with the insurrection of the Boston policemen.' To say that railroad employees are outside the provisions of the statute, is not to construe the statute, but to ingraft upon it an exception not warranted by its terms. If Congress had intended such an exception, it is fair to suppose that it would have said so affirmatively. The words of the act are plain and in terms inclusive of all classes of employment; and we find nothing in them which requires a resort to judicial construction. The reasoning of the court below really does not present a question of statutory construction, but rather an argument justifying the supposititious exception on the ground of necessity or of policy-a matter addressed to the legislative and not the judicial authority. Neither was the strike one against the Labor Board. It was a strike notwithstanding the action of the board, but against the respondent. The policemen's strike was against a governmental employer. The Labor Board was not an employer, but an arbitrator, whose determination, moreover, had only the force of \n\n[266 U.S. 42, 69]\n\u00a0\n moral suasion. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Labor Board, \n261 \nU.S. 72, 84\n, 43 S. Ct. 278. Moreover, it is to be observed that sections 21 and 22, which deal with the subject of contempts, do not contain the limitation in respect of employment contained in section 20. Section 21 ( Comp. St.  1245a) provides:\n'That any person who shall willfully disobey any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of any District Court,' etc., 'shall be proceeded against for his said contempt as hereinafter provided.'\n\n Section 22 provides for a trial by jury upon demand of the accused in all cases within the purview of the act. Whether the general language of section 21 should be limited by construction because it forms a part of an act dealing with unlawful restraints and monopolies, or for any other reason, we need not now stop to inquire. It is enough to say that in a controversy, such as we have here, at least, it does not require the existence of the status of employment at the time the acts constituting the contempt are committed, in order to bring into operation the provision for a trial by jury.\n We take no time to discuss the contention that the acts alleged as constituting contempt do not also constitute criminal offenses. According to the petition for the rule and affidavits in support of it these consisted of abusive language, assembling in numbers, picketing and other acts, for the purpose of intimidating and preventing men desirous of securing employment with the railway company from entering such employment. Prima lacie, at least, this violated the statute of Wisconsin where the acts were committed (R. S. 1921,  4466c),1 and this is enough. \n\n[266 U.S. 42, 70]\n\u00a0\n Neither is it necessary to consider at length the final contention that the jury provision of the statute is not mandatory but permissive. It is mandatory. The argument to the contrary is based on the use of the permissive word 'may'-'such trial may be by the court, or, upon demand of the accused, by a jury.' Strictly and grammatically considered, the word 'may' limits both phrases, 'by the court' and 'by a jury'; but to construe it as contended, in practical effect, would be to subvert the plain intent and good sense of the statute. And this is made clear by the history leading up to and accompanying the enactment, as well as the reports of the committees having the bill in charge. The Judiciary Committee of the House, in reporting the bill, said:\n'The trial is by the court (1) in case no jury be demanded by the accused; (2) if the contempt be in the presence of the court or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice; or (3) if the contempt be charged to be in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name or on behalf of the United States. In other cases the trial is to be by jury.' House Report, No. 613, 62d Cong., 2d Sess.\n\n The intent of Congress in adopting the provision was to give to the accused a right of trial by jury, not merely to vest authority in the judge to call a jury at his discretion. See Supervisors v. United States, 4 Wall. 435, 446, 447.\n The Sandefur Case is here on certificate requesting the instruction of this court upon the following question of law:\n'Do those provisions of section 22 of the Clayton Act which require a conviction upon a jury trial as a condition precedent to punishment for contempt, upon demand for a jury trial in the case specified, impose a valid restriction upon the inherent judicial power of the United States District Courts?' \n\n[266 U.S. 42, 71]\n\u00a0\n The facts stated in the certificate bring the case within the principle of what has already been said, and the question must be answered in the affirmative. \n No. 246\n reversed and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n No. 232, answer: Yes. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 4466c.

ROBERTSON(1924)\nNo. 145\nArgued: Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Lindley M. Garrison, of Jersey City, N. J., for appellant Miller.\n Messrs. Alfred Sutro, E. S. Pillsbury, and Frank D. Madison, all of San Francisco, Cal., Charles W. Stockton, of New York City, H. D. Pillsbury and Oscar Sutro, both of San Francisco, Cal., and Kenneth E. Stockton, of New York City, for appellant Robertson.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought under section 9 of the Act of Congress, approved October 6, 1917, known as the 'Trading with the Enemy Act,' 40 Stat. 411, 419, c. 106 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp.  3115 1\/2 e). The plaintiff below, Frederick Y. Robertson, is a citizen of the United States, and sued as assignee of the Mammoth Copper Mining Company, a Maine corporation, hereinafter called the 'seller.' The defendants are the Alien Property Custodian, the Treasurer of the United States, and five citizens of Germany, enemies of the United States, as defined by the act, copartners doing business under the name of Beer, Sondheimer & Co., and hereinafter called the 'buyers.' The purpose of the suit is to establish a 'debt' plaintiff claims to be owing from the enemy defendants on account of damages alleged to have resulted \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n to the seller from the buyers' breach of a contract for the purchase of zinc ore.\n The contract provided:\n'The product covered by this contract is the total production of zinc crude ore shipped by the seller from its properties in Shasta county, California. The buyer is not obligated to accept any of the product running less than thirty-three (33%) per cent. metallic zinc. Should the seller produce a zinc product running less than thirty-three (33%) per cent. metallic zinc, the buyer reserves the option to purchase same under the terms of this contract. If the buyer should not elect to accept such product, the seller has the privilege of disposing of it elsewhere. This contract shall run for a period of one year from the date of first shipment made after the completion of the picking plant which the seller contemplates building, but in no event shall the life of the contract exceed eighteen (18) months from the date of its execution.'\n\n Places of delivery were provided for, and the seller agreed to bear freight charges to Bartlesville, Okl., or their equivalent. Shipments were to be made in as nearly as possible equal weekly quantities. The prices were $19 per ton for ore containing 40 per cent. metallic zinc, based on a spelter price of $5 per hundredweight as St. Louis, to be increased $1 per ton for each unit of one per cent. over, and to be decreased correspondingly for each unit below, 40 per cent., and also to be increased or decreased 5 cents per ton for each cent the market price of spelter at St. Louis rose above or fell below $5 per hundredweight. And it was provided that:\n'Whenever the production or shipment of ore by the seller or the receipt or treatment of the ore by the buyer is prevented or delayed ... by ... any cause ... which may be properly termed 'vis major' ... this agreement shall be suspended juring such delay or prevention; the seller if so prevented or delayed in producing or \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n shipping the ore hereby contracted for, shall not be under any duty or obligation to furnish ore to the buyer ... while ... so prevented or delayed, and the buyer if so prevented or delayed in receiving or treating the ore hereby contracted for, shall not be under any duty or obligation to receive any of the ore hereby contracted for, while so prevented or delayed. Upon the termination of the delay or interruption herein set forth, the obligation of the contracting parties shall be resumed.'\n\n The District Court gave judgment in favor of the seller for $259,597. 21 with costs. On appeal by the Custodian and Treasurer, and a cross- appeal by the plaintiff (Judicial Code,  128 [Comp. St.  1120]), the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, except that the amount of interest allowed by the trial court was increased. Robertson v. Miller, 286 F. 503. The Custodian and Treasurer have appealed to this court. Judicial Code,  241 (Comp. St.  1218). They contend that plaintiff's claim was not a 'debt' within the meaning of section 9 of the act; that the alleged contract was lacking in mutuality and void for want of consideration; that the seller broke the contract by refusing to make shipments 'in as near as possible equal weekly quantities'; that the contract was not enforceable because made in violation of an earlier contract for the sale of the same ore; that no more than nominal damages should have been awarded; and that the lower court erred in allowing interest. The plaintiff has appealed and contends that the lower courts erred in giving the buyers credit for the amount by which the freight charges on the ore resold were less than they would have been if the ore had been shipped under the contract. The enemy defendants did not appear in the case, and it has been stipulated that the decree will not be enforced against them personally.\n\n 1. \nIs plaintiff's claim a 'debt' within the meaning of section 9 of the act? \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n This section gives to 'any person, not an enemy, or ally of enemy ... to whom any debt may be owing from an enemy, or ally of enemy' the right 'to institute a suit in equity in the District Court ... (to which suit the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, as the case may be, shall be made a party defendant), to establish the ... debt so claimed. ...'\n At the time of the passage of the act, a large amount of property was owned and much business was carried on by alien enemies and their allies in this country. Congress determined that their property should be taken over and that trade with them should cease. The purpose was to weaken enemy countries by depriving their supporters of power to give aid. But the seizure of the money and property of enemies and their allies would tend to hinder and might embarrass or ruin those having business transactions with them. By the taking, the property seized would be put out of reach of persons claiming it and beyond the power of creditors to attach it for debt. The purpose of section 9 was to prevent or lessen losses and inconvenience liable to result to non-enemy persons. This provision is highly remedial and should be liberally construed to effect the purposes of Congress and to give remedy in all cases intended to be covered. United States v. Anderson, 9 Wall. 56, 65, 66; United States V. Padelford, 9 Wall. 531, 538. The just purpose of the section is not to be defeated by a narrow interpretation or by unnecessarily restricting the meaning of the word within technical limitations. United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556, 565; Danciger v. Cooley, \n248 \nU.S. 319, 326\n, 39 S. Ct. 119; French v. Weeks, \n259 \nU.S. 326, 328\n, 42 S. Ct. 505.\n Appellants contend that 'debt,' as used in section 9, is limited to its common law meaning. Undoubtedly, Congress intended to include causes of action which at common law were enforceable in an action of debt, such as those arising \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 249]\n\u00a0\n on bonds, notes, and other express promises to pay (Raborg v. Peyton, 2 Wheat. 385; United States v. Colt, 25 Fed. Cas. 581, No. 14, 839), quantum meruit, and quantum valebat (Smith v. First Congregational Meetinghouse, 8 Pick. [Mass.] 178, 181; Norris v. School District, 12 Me. 293, 297, 28 Am. Dec. 182; Jenkins v. Richardson, 6 J. J. Marsh. [Ky.] 441, 22 Am. Dec. 82; Mahaffey v. Petty, 1 Ga. 261, 264).\n The meaning of the word 'debt,' as used in many statutes, is not restricted to demands enforceable in actions of debt. Lord Coke, referring to the statute of Merton (A. D. 1235), said (Institutes, volume 2, page 89):\n'Debitum signifieth not only debt, for which an action of debt doth lie, but here in this ancient act of parliament, it signifieth generally any duty to be yielded or paid. ...'\n\n Chief Justice Shaw, referring to a statute making members of a corporation liable for its 'debts,' said (Mill Dam Foundery v. Hovey, 21 Pick. [Mass.] 417, 455):\n'For, though a question was made, whether such a claim for unliquidated damages is a debt, within the meaning of the statute, we do not think it admits of a reasonable doubt, that all such claims for damages were intended to be included in the term 'debts.\"\n\n A cause of action for damages for breach of contract is a debt within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act, and of laws relating to attachments, to receiverships, to stockholders' liability for corporate debts, to probate, to set-offs, to fraudulent conveyances. and to limitation of actions. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 243, 250]\n\u00a0\n There is nothing in the language of the act or the reasons for its enactment to indicate a purpose to restrict the right to institute suits in equity as authorized in section 9 to causes of action cognizable in debt under technical procedural rules. The words of a statute are to be read in their natural and ordinary sense, giving them a meaning to their full extent and capacity, unless some strong reason to the contrary appears. Birks, App., Allison, Resp., 13 C. B. (N. S.) 12, 23; Minor v. Mechanics' Bank, 1 Pet. 46, 64; De Ganay v. Lederer, \n250 \nU.S. 376, 381\n, 39 S. Ct. 524\n\n\n We think it immaterial whether plaintiff's cause of action is one for which an action of debt might be maintained. It would be unreasonable and contrary to the intention of Congress to exclude claims like that here in question, and we hold them to be included.\n\n 2. \nWas there a lack of mutuality and want of consideration? Appellants contend that the parties failed to make a contract, and asserted the seller promised only such ore as \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 251]\n\u00a0\n it might ship from the mine and was not bound to ship all the ore produced or to mine or ship any ore. They also argue that certain statements made by the seller's manager, in correspondence between him and the agent of the buyers, after the instrument was signed, show that the seller itself so interpreted the writing. The provision to which they refer is this: 'The product covered by this contract is the total production of zinc crude ore shipped by the seller from its properties in Shasta county, California.' The statements of the manager were made in October and November, 1914, in answer to inquiries of the buyers' agent, and were to the effect that the tonnage of ore to be shipped depended altogether on the market price of spelter, and that with spelter quotations below $5 per hundred weight shipments would be very light, and that if prices rose above that figure, the seller would probably ship about 200 tons per month.\n The intention of the parties is to be gathered, not from the single sentence above quoted, but from the whole instrument read in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of negotiations leading up to its execution. The buyers had a large business in the smelting of zinc ore in the United States. The seller had been engaged for a long time in the mining of copper ore from the Mammoth mine. Early in 1914, there was discovered in that mine a large body of zinc ore, containing about 40,000 tons. The sellers desired to dispose of, and the buyers wanted, zinc ore. While there had been no regular weekly or monthly production or shipments prior to the signing of the writing, the seller had made a number of shipments to the buyers. The work of developing the ore body in preparation for production was in progress. The mine was already equipped and capable of producing ore. The writing shows that the completion of a picking plant was contemplated. The year covered was to commence on the date of the first shipment after its completion. When \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 252]\n\u00a0\n the instrument was executed, September 29, 1914, both parties knew the quality of the ore and that the quantity was substantial.\n The parties intended to make a contract-one to sell, and the other to buy, zinc ore. By plain statements and manifest implications, the seller was bound for a definite time not otherwise to dispose of its ore; the buyers were given an option on the lower grade ore; the seller was bound at all times, when not prevented or delayed by some cause beyond its control, to mine and to ship to the buyers the total production of zinc ore of the specified grade; and the buyers were bound to take and pay for all such ore when not prevented or delayed by causes beyond their control as specified in the contract. The quantities of ore to be mined and shipped were not limited to those to be produced by the equipment and methods employed at the time of the execution of the contract. The proposed picking plant was to be added, and increased output was expected and bargained for.\n The opinion of the manager of the seller as to its legal obligations under the contract, as reflected by his statements in correspondence after the execution of the instrument, is not entitled to any weight in determining whether a valid contract was made. The writing did not give the seller the option to ship or to refrain from shipping as it saw fit, or leave the quantity to be delivered to its choice. There was no want of consideration or lack of mutuality.\n\n 3. \nAppellants contend that the seller failed to make shipments in as nearly as possible equal weekly quantities, as provided in the contract, and that the buyers thereby were released from performance.\n The contract was signed September 29, 1914, but the first shipment was not until November 28. Between the last-mentioned date and March 11, the seller made 28 shipments, which were accepted and paid for. There was \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 253]\n\u00a0\n considerable inequality in the weekly shipments. It is apparent from the language of the contract that variations were expected. It was contemplated that production would be increased substantially by the use of the picking plant. From the time of the execution of the contract to about the time of the first shipment the market price of spelter did not exceed $5 per hundredweight and consequently the contract price of ore was not more than $19 per ton. When the first shipments were made, spelter prices were $5.10 per hundredweight. By March 1, they advanced to $9.40, making the contract price of ore $41 per ton. By March 17, they receded to $ 7.80, making the contract price of ore $33 per ton. January 20, when spelter was at $6 per hundredweight and the contract price of ore was $24 a ton, the agent of the buyers wrote a letter to the manager of the seller in which he called attention to the high price and, in effect, suggested that the seller ship as much as possible.\n Later, the prices of spelter rose enormously, but the market prices of ore declined until buyers could obtain it on their own terms. The war had created a great demand for zinc. The ores produced in Japan, Spain, Mexico, and Australia were cut off from their former markets in Germany and were shipped into this country in quantities far in excess of the capacity of the smelters. February 23, when the spelter prices were over $ 8 per hundredweight, making the price of ore more than $34 per ton, the buyers tried to get the seller to consent to reduction of the contract prices. But no change was made. Increased tonnages were shipped after completion of the picking plant, March 5. March 17, the buyers sent a telegram to the seller, calling attention to the shipment of 50 tons daily from March 6 to March 9, and stating that the monthly average from the beginning had been about 200 tons, and added:\n'In view of abnormal conditions we will only accept tonnages reasonably equal to the average monthly amount \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 254]\n\u00a0\n shipped heretofore. We are unable to receive and smelt any further tonnage in accordance with page five [meaning the vis major clause] of our contract with you. We have advised all other shippers accordingly.'\n\n They did not object to inequality of weekly shipments, but attempted to invoke the vis major clause to justify or excuse their refusal to take and pay for the ore at the contract price applicable at that time.\n The District Court found that the seller attempted in good faith to carry out its part of the contract until it was stopped; that the claim that the seller broke the contract was without merit; that no objection to the deliveries was made on the ground of inequality, and that the breach was waived as to all ore accepted; that the buyers' refusal to accept the ore tendered in March was based solely on the vis major clause; and that there was no evidence that the seller did not ship in as nearly equal weekly quantities as possible. And the Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Mammoth Company carried out its promises under the terms of the contract. No reason has been shown why the findings of the lower courts should be disturbed. Washington Securities Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 76, 78\n, 34 S. Ct. 725. Our own examination of the evidence satisfies us that there is no merit in appellants' contention that there was a breach of the contract by the seller.\n\n 4. \nAppellants contend that the contract sued on was not enforceable because made in violation of an earlier agreement, dated June 10, 1914, selling the same ore.\n The Mammoth Mining Company, operating in Kennett, Cal., and the United States Smelting Company, operating in Salt Lake City, Utah, were subsidiaries of the United States Smelting, Refining & Mining Company. The executive officers and boards of directors of the subsidiary companies and of the parent company were substantially identical, but each subsidiary had a \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 255]\n\u00a0\n separate general manager and operating staff. On June 10, 1914, the Smelting Company made a contract covering the sale of certain ores to the American Metal Company, and appellants assert that it covered the same ore which was subsequently sold by the contract in suit. The product described in the earlier contract is:\n'All the zinc sulphide crude ore, zinc sulphide concentrates and zinc sulphide middlings, shipped from Midvale, Utah, Kennett, Cal., or any other point by or under the control of the seller during the period of this agreement.'\n\n Through some misapprehension, the lower courts considered the case as if the Mammoth Company were a subsidiary of the Smelting Company. This was more favorable to appellants than was warranted by the facts. Nevertheless, they declined to sustain appellants' contention. Both held that the Mammoth Company and the Smelting Company were separate and independent corporations, and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Smelting Company did not make the contract for the Mammoth Company. 286 F. 503, 509. The zinc product of the Mammoth Mine is not specifically mentioned. The language is not definite, and, as that mine is at Kennett, one of the shipping points mentioned, the product might be deemed to be included, if under the control of the Smelting Company. Neither of the parties to this suit was a party to that contract, and parol evidence was given to show what ore was covered. Barreda v. Silsbee, 21 How. 146, 169; Central Coal & Coke Co. v. Good & Co., 120 F. 793, 798, 57 C. C. A. 161. It was shown that the Mammoth Company and the Smelting Company, while both subsidiary to the Mining Company, were wholly independent; that neither had control over the other and that the Smelting Company did not control and had no authority to sell the product of the Mammoth Mine. Appellants' contention is not supported by the facts. \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 256]\n\u00a0\n 5. Appellants insist that no more than nominal damages should have been awarded because, as they say, the evidence showed no actual loss on resale. After Beer, Sondheimer & Co. rejected the ore, the Mammoth Company resold it to the United States Smelting Company. The amount of the judgment is based on the difference between resale prices and those fixed by the contract in suit. The purchaser smelted the ore and made a profit. The master found that the price obtained on resale represented the best price that the Mammoth Company could obtain after energetic efforts in good faith to sell the ore on more favorable terms. Appellants make no claim of bad faith. There was no dispute as to the evidentiary facts. The report of the master was confirmed by the trial court, and its ruling was sustained on appeal. It must be taken as established that the resale was made in good faith for the best obtainable price. Crawford v. Neal, \n144 \nU.S. 585, 596\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 759. The Mammoth Company and the Smelting Company were separate entities. The intercorporate relations above referred to furnish no ground for charging against the Mammoth Company the profits made by the Smelting Company. It is obvious from the facts found that the latter could have obtained zinc ore in the market on as favorable terms. The Mammoth Company did not operate a smelter or use the ore in its own business. The smelting of the ore was separate and apart from the contract in suit, and the seller was not bound to smelt the ore or have it smelted and account for the profits, if any, to the buyers. The amount of profits realized by the Smelting Company was immaterial, and the buyers had no right to have it set off against the damages resulting from their breach of the contract.\n\n 6. \nThe District Court allowed interest from July 3, 1919; the Circuit Court of Appeals from June 29, 1916. Appellants object on the ground that this is a suit against the United States, and interest is not allowable against it; \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 257]\n\u00a0\n that at common law interest was not recoverable, and the case was not a proper one for the exercise of chancery discretion; and that, if it was not an abuse of discretion to allow interest from the date when the war was practically ended, its allowance from June 29, 1916, was erroneous. In an attempt to commence an action in Utah against the buyers to recover damages resulting from their breach, the seller, on June 29, 1916, served a summons and complaint on the representatives of the buyers. On the facts found, which need not be repeated here, the Circuit Court of Appeals (286 F. 511) rightly held the attempted service to amount to a demand, and that interest might be allowed from that date. See Goddard v. Foster, 17 Wall. 123, 143; Kaufman v. Tredway, \n195 \nU.S. 271, 273\n, 25 S. Ct. 33; United States v. Poulson (D. C.) 30 F. 231; Dwyer v. United States, 93 F. 616, 35 C. C. A. 488; Mather v. Stokely, 218 F. 764, 767, 134 C. C. A. 442.\n While the suit, as held in Banco Mexicano v. Deutsche Bank, \n263 \nU.S. 591, 603\n, 44 S. Ct. 209 (affirming 53 App. D. C. 266, 289 F. 924), is one against the United States, the claim was not against it. No debt was alleged to be owing from it to the plaintiff. The rule of sovereign immunity from liability for interest (Judicial Code,  177 (Comp. St. 1168) National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers v. Parrish, \n229 \nU.S. 494\n, 33 S. Ct. 944; United States v. North American Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330, 336\n, 40 S. Ct. 518; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 304\n, 43 S. Ct. 354) does not apply.\n Compensation is a fundamental principle of damages whether the action is in contract or in tort. Wicker v. Hoppock, 6 Wall. 94, 99. One who fails to perform his contract is justly bound to make good all damages that accrue naturally from the breach; and the other party is entitled to be put in as good a position pecuniarily as he would have been by performance of the contract. Curtis v. Innerarity, 6 How. 146, 154. One who has had the use of money owing to another justly may be required to pay interest from the time the payment should have been \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 258]\n\u00a0\n made. Both in law and in equity, interest is allowed on money due. Spalding v. Mason, \n161 \nU.S. 375, 396\n, 16 S. Ct. 592. Generally, interest is not allowed upon unliquidated damages. Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 653. But when necessary in order to arrive at fair compensation, the court in the exercise of a sound discretion may include interest or its equivalent as an element of damages. See Bernhard v. Rochester German Insurance Co., 79 Conn. 388, 397, 65 A. 134, 8 Ann. Cas. 298; Frazer v. Bigelow, 141 Mass. 126, 4 N. E. 620; Faber v. City of New York, 222 N. Y. 255, 262, 118 N. E. 609; De La Rama v. De La Rama, \n241 \nU.S. 154, 159\n, 160 S., 36 S. Ct. 518, Ann. Cas. 1914c, 411; The Paquete Habana, \n189 \nU.S. 453, 467\n, 23 S. Ct. 593; Eddy v. La Fayette, \n163 \nU.S. 456, 467\n, 16 S. Ct. 1082; Demotte v. Whybrow (C. C. A.) 263 F. 366, 368.\n In this case, at least as early as June 29, 1916, the date of demand, the seller was entitled to have from the buyers the difference between the sum which it would have received prior to that date, if the buyers had kept their contract, and the amount it received on resale. Payment in 1924 or later of that sum is not full compensation. Cf. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United States, supra, 306 (43 S. Ct. 354). All damages had accrued prior to the demand. There was nothing dependent on any future event. The elements necessary to a calculation of the amount the seller was then entitled to have to make it whole-namely, the quantities of ore produced, its metallic content, the prices to be paid by the buyers under the contract, and the amount realized on resale-were known or ascertainable. Our entrance into the war was long subsequent to June 29, 1916, the date of the demand. General representatives, who had long been in charge of the business in this country of Beer, Sondheimer & Co., remained here until after that event. At all times until it was taken over under the act, they had money and property of that firm more than sufficient to make good the seller's damages. It would be unjust and inconsistent with the remedial purposes of section 9 to hold that the seized enemy property cannot \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 259]\n\u00a0\n be held for the full amount of the seller's loss, and that, to the extent of interest during the period of the war,2 compensation must be denied. The proposition that the enemy defendants, as a matter of law, are entitled to be relieved from interest during the war cannot be sustained. Cf. Ward v. Smith, 7 Wall. 447, 452; Connecticut v. Pennsylvania, 6 Fed. Cas. pages 282, 291, No. 3104; Yeaton v. Berney, 62 Ill. 61, 63; Gates v. Union Bank, 12 Heisk. (Tenn.) 325, 330. The allowance of interest made by the Circuit Court of Appeals was just and is sustained.\n\n 7. \nThe seller agreed to deliver the ore free on board cars at the buyers' smelting works at Bartlesville, Okl., or at such other works as the buyers might designate, and any difference of freight charges between the point of shipment and other smelting works so designated as against those to Bartlesville should be for the account of the buyers. The ore which was rejected by the buyers and resold was shipped to Altoona, Kan. The freight rates were graduated on the basis of 'actual value' of the ore shipped and were the same from Kennett, Cal., to Altoona as to Bartlesville. The rates on the shipments to Bartlesville were based on the prices fixed by the contract in suit; and those on shipments made to Altoona on the resale prices. The charges for the transportation of ore resold were $42,201.50 less than they would have been if based on prices fixed by the original contract. The master reported that if the ore had been shipped under the contract the carrier, for the lack of any other available standard, would have based its rates on the contract prices. And he excluded from the amount fixed as damages the excess over the charges actually paid. His report was adopted by the trial court, and its decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The plaintiff \n\n[266 U.S. 243, 260]\n\u00a0\n on his appeal contends that under the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.) there cannot be two freight rates in effect at the same time between the same points on the same commodity dependent upon the invoice under which it is shipped, and that the courts below erred in making the deduction. But we think that the question whether rates that might be so produced would be unlawful was not involved in the case. The ore covered by the original contract was not shipped from Kennett to Bartlesville and Altoona at the same time, nor would it have been if there had been no breach; and it was not shown that any other zinc ore was so moved. If different rates had been exacted for contemporaneous transportation of ore to the same destination, or its equivalent, a question between the carrier and shipper might have arisen. But on the facts of this case no such question was involved. The cost of transportation on the resale was less than itwould have been if the buyers had accepted all the ore. Both courts so found. The seller was not entitled to charge against the buyer anything on account of the expense of resale in excess of the amount it paid. It was not entitled to be put in a better position by the recovery than if the buyers had fully performed the contract. Plaintiff's appeal is without merit.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Bankruptcy Act: Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium Ass'n, \n240 \nU.S. 581, 592\n, 36 S. Ct. 412, L. R.

Claiming that while on the line of the last-named company she was assaulted by the auditor, she instituted an action to recover damages from the selling carrier in the circuit court for St. Francis county, Ark.\n Defending, the carrier set up and established that the ticket called for passage over three independent lines and contained the following:\n'In selling this ticket and checking baggage hereon, the selling carrier acts only as agent and is not responsible beyond its own lines.'\n\n And it maintained that any assault upon respondent was by the auditor of the International & Great Northern Railroad Company for whose acts petitioner was not responsible.\n The ticket was purchased over the telephone.

WESTERN CRAWFORD ROAD IMP DIST(1924)\nNo. 67\nArgued: Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n Messrs. Harry P. Warner and Thomas B. Pryor, both of Ft. Smith, Ark., and W. F. Evans and Edward J. White, both of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. E. L. Matlock, of Van Buren, Ark., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1920 Arkansas created the Western Crawford road improvement district by a special act. Pursuant to its provisions the commissioners named therein took the \n\n[266 U.S. 187, 188]\n\u00a0\n proceedings incident to organizing the district. They determined what work would be required, estimated the cost thereof, and had the preliminary assessment made of the benefits and burdens. In so doing the commissioners necessarily incurred expenses for publication of notices, for the services of engineers, lawyers, and assessors, and for other matters. After the required data had been obtained, it was concluded that the cost of the proposed improvement would probably exceed the benefits, and the project was duly abandoned. The aggregate preliminary expense was $20,611.80. The special act had provided:\n'Sec. 25. In case, for any reason, the improvement contemplated by this district is not made, the preliminary expense shall be a first lien upon all of the land in the district, and shall be paid by a levy of a tax thereon upon the assessed value for county and state taxation, which levy shall be made by the chancery court of Crawford county and shall be collected by a receiver to be appointed by the court.'\n\n For the purpose of paying the preliminary expense the commissioners applied to the appropriate court for a tax levy. A decree was entered for a levy of 1.65 per cent. on the assessed value of the land in the district subject to taxation. Thereupon the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company1 brought, in the same court, this suit to restrain enforcement of the decree. The aggregate assessed value of property within the district was $ 1,453,938. The assessed value of the Missouri Pacific property was $145, 250. The tax assessed against its property to defray the preliminary expense was $2,396.62. The board of assessors \n\n[266 U.S. 187, 189]\n\u00a0\n appointed under the special act estimated the amount of the anticipated benefit at $1,960. The sole objection of the railroad was that the tax to defray the preliminary expense was distributed in proportion to the assessed value of the property, instead of in proportion to the amount of the benefit thereto which it was estimated would accrue if the improvement was made. It argued that the smaller sum would, under both the state and the federal Constitution, have been the limit of its assessment for the improvement if carried out; that it could not be taxed more for the preliminary expense of a projected improvement which had been abandoned; and that, therefore, section 25 violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Arkansas sustained the decree for a levy as originally entered. 157 Ark. 304, 248 S. W. 563. That judgment is here on writ of error.\n The state court held that the provision in section 25 for payment of preliminary expenses necessarily implied a legislative determination that the cost of the preliminary expenses would not exceed the anticipated benefits of the construction of the improvement; that this legislative determination is conclusive unless shown to be arbitrary and unreasonable; that nothing was shown to overcome the legislative determination except the unapproved assessment lists filed by the board of assessors; that the assessment was incomplete because it was never approved by the board of commissioners; and that, since the abandonment of the project relieved them from the duty of considering its correctness, the court cannot know what the assessment against the railroad would have been, had the assessment of benefits been proceeded with. The lower court held, therefore, that the tax laid was not obnoxious either to the state Constitution or to that of the United States. \n\n[266 U.S. 187, 190]\n\u00a0\n So far as concerns the federal Constitution, the validity of the tax may be rested, also, on other grounds. A state may defray the cost of constructing a highway, in whole or in part, by means of a special assessment upon property specially benefited thereby. But it is not obliged to do so. Road building is a public purpose which may by effected by general taxation. The cost may be defrayed out of state funds, or a tax district may be created to meet the authorized outlay. The preliminary inquiry whether it is desirable to construct the road, is one in which all landowners within the district are interested. The Fourteenth Amendment does not require that taxes laid for this purpose shall be according to the benefits to be received by the person or thing taxed. Compare Kelly v. Pittsburg, \n104 U.S. 78\n. The cost of making the investigation may be met by a fixed charge per acre, as in Houck v. Little River Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 254\n, 36 S. Ct. 58, and Miller & Lux v. Sacramento & San Joaquin Drainage District, \n256 \nU.S. 129\n, 41 S. Ct. 404, or by distributing the cost over all the land in the district in proportion to its value as assessed for county and state taxation, or otherwise.

Only the question of jurisdiction is here.\n An information charged that plaintiffs in error willfully disobeyed the injunction lawfully issued in equity cause, St. Louis, San Francisco Railway Company, Complainant, v. International Association of Machinists, et al., Defendants, pending in the Western Division of the Western District \n\n[264 U.S. 95, 101]\n\u00a0\n of Missouri, by attempting, within the Southwestern Division of the same district, to prevent certain railroad employees from continuing at work. The order ran against men on strike, and the cause is treated as one within the purview of the Clayton Act (October 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730). Sections 21, 22 24, and 25 of that act (Comp. St.  1245a, 1245b, 1245d, 1245e) are set out below. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Counsel for plaintiffs in error maintain that ordinary contempts punishable by courts of equity without trial by jury differ radically from the 'statutory contempt' here disclosed, which, under the Clayton Act, must be dealt with as a criminal offense. And they insist that sections 51, 52, \n\n[264 U.S. 95, 102]\n\u00a0\n and 53, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1033-1035), control the venue when such 'statutory contempt' is alleged.\n Section 51 provides that, with certain exceptions:\n'No person shall be arrested in one district for trial in another, in any civil action before a District Court.'\n\n Section 52:-\n'When a state contains more than one district, every suit not of a local nature, in the District Court thereof, against a single defendant, inhabitant of such state, must be brought in the district where he resides; but if there are two or more defendants, residing in different districts of the state, it may be brought in either district, and a duplicate writ may be issued against the defendants, directed to the marshal of any other district in which any defendant resides.'\n\n Section 53:\n'When a district* \n\n[264 U.S. 95, 103]\n\u00a0\n contains more than one division every suit not of a local nature against a single defendant must be brought in the division where he resides; but if there are two or more defendants residing in different divisions of the district it may be brought in either division. ... All prosecutions for crimes or offenses shall be had within the division of such districts where the same were committed, unless the court, or the judge thereof, upon the application of the defendant, shall order the cause to be transferred for prosecution to another division of the district.'\n\n None of the cited Code sections makes specific reference to comtempt proceedings. These are sui generis-neither civil actions nor prosecutions for offenses, within the ordinary meaning of those terms-and exertions of the power inherent in all courts to enforce obedience, something they must possess in order properly to perform their functions. Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co., \n194 \nU.S. 324, 326\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 665. \n\n[264 U.S. 95, 104]\n\u00a0\n To disobey a judicial order is not declared criminal by the Clayton Act. It recognizes that such disobedience may be contempt and, having prescribed limitations, leaves the court to deal with the offender. While it gives the right to trial by jury and restricts the punishment, it also clearly recognizes the distinction between 'proceeding for contempt' and 'criminal prosecution.' 'No proceeding for contempt shall be instituted against any person unless begun within one year from the date of the act complained of; nor shall any such proceeding be a bar to any criminal prosecution for the same act or acts.' Section 25.\n The Clayton Act says nothing about venue in contempt proceedings; leaves it as theretofore. The power of the court below to issue the enjoining order is not questioned. By disobeying the order, plaintiffs in error defied an authority which that tribunal was required to vindicate. It followed established practice, as modified by the statute; and we think the objections to its jurisdiction are unsubstantial.\n The following cases are in point: Eilenbecker v. District Court of Plymouth County, \n134 U.S. 31\n, 35, et seq., 10 Sup. Ct. 424; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447, 489\n, 155 S. U. S. 3, 14 Sup. Ct. 1125, 15 Sup.

Cas. 1915D, 1044, does not support the claim that the challenged contempt proceedings amounted to prosecution for a criminal offense within the intendment of section 53, Judicial Code. While contempt may be an offense against the law and subject to appropriate punishment, certain it is that since the foundation of our government proceedings to punish such offenses have been- \n\n[264 U.S. 95, 105]\n\u00a0\n regarded as sui generis and not 'criminal prosecutions' within the Sixth Amendment or common understanding.\n The judgment below must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 21. That any person who shall willfully disobey any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of any District Court of the United States or any court of the District of Columbia by doing any act or thing therein, or thereby forbidden to be done by him, if the act or thing so done by him be of such character as to constitute also a creminal offense under any statute of the United States, or under the laws of any state in which the act was committed, shall be proceeded against for his said contempt as hereinafter provided.\n Sec. 22. That whenever it shall be made to appear to any District Court or judge thereof, or to any judge therein sitting, by the return of a proper officer on lawful process, or upon the affidavit of some credible person, or by information filed by any district attorney, that there is reasonable ground to believe that any person has been guilty of such contempt, the court or judge thereof, or any judge therein sitting, may issue a rule requiring the said person so charged to show cause upon a day certain why he should not be punished therefor, which rule, together with a copy of the affidavit or information, shall be served upon the person charged, with sufficient promptness to enable him to prepare for and make return to the order at the time fixed therein. If upon or by such return, in the judgment of the court, the alleged contempt be not sufficiently purged, a trial shall be directed at a time and place fixed by the court: Provided, however, that if the accused, being a natural person, fail or refuse to make return to the rule to show cause, an attachment may issue against his person to compel an answer, and in case of his continued failure or refusal, or if for any reason it be impracticable to dispose of the matter on the return day, he may be required to give reasonable bail for his attendance at the trial and his submission to the final judgment of the court. Where the accused is a body corporate, an attachment for the sequestration of its property may be issued upon like refusal or failure to answer.\n In all cases within the purview of this act such trial may be by the court, or, upon demand of the accused, by a jury; in which latter event the court may impanel a jury from the jurors then in attendance, or the court or the judge thereof in chambers may cause a sufficient number of jurors to be selected and summoned, as provided by law, to attend at the time and place of trial, at which time a jury shall be selected and impaneled as upon a trial for misdemeanor; and such trial shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice in criminal cases prosecuted by indictment or upon information.\n If the accused be found guilty, judgment shall be entered accordingly, prescribing the punishment, either by fine or imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the court. Such fine shall be paid to the United States or to \n the complainant or other party injured by the act constituting the contempt, or may, where more than one is so damaged, be divided or apportioned among them as the court may direct, but in no case shall the fine to be paid to the United States exceed, in case the accused is a natural person, the sum of $1,000, nor shall such imprisonment exceed the term of six months: Provided, that in any case the court or a judge thereof may, for good cause shown, by affidavit or proof taken in open court or before such judge and filed with the papers in the case, dispense with the rule to show cause, and may issue an attachment for the arrest of the person charged with contempt; in which event such person, when arrested, shall be brought before such court or a judge thereof without unnecessary delay and shall be admitted to bail in a reasonable penalty for his appearance to answer to the charge or for trial for the contempt; and thereafter the proceedings shall be the same as provided herein in case the rule had issued in the first instance.\n Sec. 24. That nothing herein contained shall be construed to relate to contempts committed in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, nor to contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States, but the same, and all other cases of contempt not specifically embraced within section twenty-one of this act, may be punished in conformity to the usages at law and in equity now prevailing.\n Sec. 25. That no proceeding for contempt shall be instituted against any person unless begun within one year from the date of the act complained of; nor shall any such proceeding be a bar to any criminal prosecution for the same act or acts; but nothing herein contained shall affect any proceedings in contempt pending at the time of the passage of this act. \n\n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNASSAU SMELTING & REFINING WORKS v. BRIGHTWOOD BRONZE FOUNDRY CO.(1924)\nNo. 242\nArgued: April 28, 1924Decided: April 28, 1924\n\n\nDecided, May 26, 1924.\n\n\n Mr. Joseph B. Jacobs, and Jacobs & Jacobs, all of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harry M. Ehrlich, of Springfield, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On November 19, 1920, the Brightwood Foundry Company was adjudged a bankrupt by the District Court of Massachusetts. On February 12, 1921, it made an offer of composition to its creditors. On February 25, 1921, the meeting to consider the offer was held. \n1\n The list of \n\n[265 U.S. 269, 270]\n\u00a0\n creditors provided for in section 7(8) of the Bankruptcy Act (Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, 548 [Comp. St.  9591]), had been filed by the bankrupt on February 16, 1921. Among those scheduled, was the Nassau Smelting & Refining Works, with a claim of $11,354.40. It had due notice of all proceedings, but failed to present its claim for proof until more than a year after the adjudication. No order was made either allowing or disallowing it. On March 27, 1922-more than a year after the meeting to consider the offer in composition-the bankrupt filed a petition in which it alleged that the offer had been accepted by the requisite majority of creditors, and that many who had been duly scheduled failed to prove their claims within the year after adjudication as provided by section 57n. It prayed for an order that only such sum be deposited as would be required to pay, in composition, claims seasonably proved. After due hearing, the prayer of the bankrupt was granted. Objection had been made by the Nassau Works; and it filed a petition to revise under section 24b (Comp. St.  9608). The order was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Circuit Judge Anderson dissenting, 286 Fed. 72; and a petition for a writ of certiorari was granted, \n261 U.S. 612\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 519. The question for decision is whether the deposit must include the amount required to pay creditors who were named in the schedule but failed to prove their claims within one year after the adjudication. In other words, are such creditors entitled to the benefit of the composition?\n The Bankruptcy Act provides, in section 57n (Comp. St.  9641), that 'claims shall not be proved against a bankrupt estate subsequent to one year after the adjudication'; in section 12a, that 'a bankrupt may offer, either before or after adjudication, terms of composition to his creditors after ... he had ... filed in court ... the list of his creditors required to be filed by bankrupts,' and that 'action upon the petition for adjudication shall be delayed until \n\n[265 U.S. 269, 271]\n\u00a0\n it shall be determined whether such composition shall be confirmed'; in section 12b, that the application for the confirmation of a composition may not be filed in the court until 'it has been accepted in writing by a majority in number of all creditors whose claims have been allowed, which number must represent a majority in amount of such claims, and the consideration to be paid by the bankrupt to his creditors, ... have been deposited in such place as shall be designated by and subject to the order of the judge'; and in section 12e, that 'upon the confirmation of a composition, the consideration shall be distributed as the judge shall direct, and the case dismissed.' \n2\n Comp. St.  9596\n\n\n Composition is a settlement by the bankrupt with his creditors. In a measure, the composition supersedes, and is outside of, the bankruptcy proceedings. Cumberland Glass Co. v. DeWitt, \n237 \nU.S. 447, 454\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 636. It originates in a voluntary offer by the bankrupt; and results, in the main, from voluntary acceptance by his creditors. It cannot be confirmed unless there has been such acceptance by the requisite majority. When confirmed the bankrupt is discharged from all debts 'other than those agreed to be paid by the terms of the composition and not affected by a discharge. Section 14c (Comp. St.  9598). Thus, the composition binds creditors with scheduled claims, although they do not prove. It may be effected before the adjudication. \n3\n Where the assets have passed to the trustee pursuant to the adjudication, they are revested in the bankrupt. \n\n[265 U.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n There is no provision in the act which declares, in terms, that the offer extends only to those who prove their claims. Why should proof, within the year, of the existence of the debt be required where, by including the claim in the schedule, it has been admitted by the bankrupt? Obviously, section 57n does not operate to exclude any creditor from the benefits of the composition, where the offer is made before there is an adjudication. \n4\n Section 57n would, also, have no application in a great majority of composition cases in which there has been an adjudication. For the offer is ordinarily made in order to enable the debtor to resume his business. In the normal case, the bankrupt is impelled by vital interests, not only to make the offer promptly, but to expedite confirmation. Interruption incident to delay necessarily impairs the value of a business as a going concern. Thus, the composition is usually carried through within the year. Creditors who have failed to prove their claims before confirmation (from inadvertence or because of their doubt whether it was worth the trouble and expense) are usually spurred to activity by notice that money on deposit awaits their application. The cases are rare in which a scheduled creditor who has had due notice fails to call, within the year, for the money awaiting him.\n Where the distribution is of the bankrupt estate, each creditor has an interest in the claim which any other creditor may assert. He is interested in limiting the amount of claims to be allowed, because the greater the aggregate, the smaller (except where there is a surplus) will be his dividend. Each creditor is interested, also, in limiting the time within which others may prove, because distribution cannot be made until the close of that period. But where there is a composition, neither the amount \n\n[265 U.S. 269, 273]\n\u00a0\n which a creditor receives, nor the time when he receives it, can be affected by the amount of others' claims, or by the time of proof, or by their failure to prove. \n5\n The rights of each creditor are fixed by the terms of the debtor's offer, subject only to its confirmation and the judge's order of distribution. Nor can the time of proof of claims, as distinguished from their allowance, be of legitimate interest to the bankrupt. \n6\n His rights, also, are fixed by the offer, unless where the legality or the amount of a claim is questioned. No reason is suggested why Congress should have wished to bar creditors from participation in the benefits of a composition merely because their claims were not proved within a year of the adjudication. Failure to prove within the year does not harm the bankrupt. Why should he gain thereby? And why should the creditor be penalized by a total loss of his claim?\n The language of the act tends to support the contention that proof within the year is not essential to participation in the benefits of the composition. Section 57n declares that 'claims shall not be proved against a bankrupt estate subsequent to one year after the adjudication.' There is no 'bankrupt estate' where there is no adjudication, and even where there is an adjudication, the proof made \n\n[265 U.S. 269, 274]\n\u00a0\n is not against the 'bankrupt estate,' if a composition follows. The claim is against funds deposited by the debtor pursuant to a bargain with his creditors. Allowance of a claim is necessary to qualify one as a voter on the question of acceptance. Hence, provision for such allowance had to be made. Section 12a. But after the composition has been confirmed, allowance of a claim is not necessary for the purpose of establishing it as against the debtor, who is then alone interested, if he has already admitted the liability by including it in his schedule. Compare Haley v. Pope, 206 Fed. 266, 124 C. C. A. 330. Here the offer was made within three months of the adjudication. It confessedly extended to all scheduled creditors who should prove within the year. No reason is shown why it should be limited to these. In re Atlantic Construction Co. (D. C.) 228 Fed. 571; In re Fox, 6 Am. Banker. Rep. 525.\n Where the offer of composition is not made until after the expiration of the year the question may be different.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors had been made September 10, 1920. The creditors elected a trustee in bankruptcy at a special meeting held March 17, 1922, but he did not qualify. The assignee under the voluntary assignment remained in possession of the assets formerly belonging to the bankrupt. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The official form [No 61] of 'application for confirmation of composition' recites that after the bankrupt 'had filed in court ... a list of his creditors, as required by law, he offered terms of composition to his creditors, ... and 'that the consideration to be paid by the bankrupt to his creditors ... has been deposited,' etc. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Act June 25, 1910, c. 412,  5, 36 Stat. 838, 839 (Comp. St.  9696). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Judge Anderson states (page 75): 'In recent years more than two- thirds of the conposition cases in this district have been without adjudication.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Prior to confirmation, he may have this remote interest in the allowance, as distinguished from the proof, of the claims of others. If he favors confirmation, he will be interested in having allowed the claims of other friendly creditors whose acceptance is needed to make up the requisite majority. If he opposes confirmation, he will be interested in having claims of friendly creditors disallowed and of ahving those of hostile creditors allowed. He may also be interested in inquiring whether a claim scheduled is fraudulent. This is equally true of cases where there has been and where there has not been an adjudication. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] He may conceivably be interested in having a claim allowed or disallowed, because of its effect upon the acceptance of his offer by the requisite majority of creditors. Here, also, this remoter interest is the same, whether there has been an adjudication or has not. \n\n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNASSAU SMELTING & REFINING WORKS v. U S(1924)\nNo. 37\nArgued: Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 101, 102]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. S. Gilbert, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the United States against the Nassau Smelting & Refining Works in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, to recover $15,000, with interest at 6 per cent., for copper bands and pig lead sold and delivered. By its amended answer the defendant did not deny its obligation as claimed, but set up, as counterclaims, balances due from the United States to it of $6,023.81 for one delivery of copper bands, another of $5,836.42, and a third of \n\n[266 U.S. 101, 105]\n\u00a0\n $2,576.09. The averment in the answer is, as to each of these claims, that the agreement upon which the bands were furnished was not executed in the manner prescribed by law, and so was embraced within the saving provisions of section 1 of the Act approved March 2, 1919, entitled 'An act to provide relief in cases of contracts connected with the prosecution of the war and for other purposes,' and known as the Dent Act (chapter 94, 40 Stat. 1272. [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 14\/15a to 3115 14\/15e]). The defendant's contention was that, as each counterclaim was for less than $10,000, subdivision 20 of section 24 of the Judicial Code of the United States (Comp. St.  991) gave the District Court jurisdiction to find and award, by way of counterclaims herein, a fair and just compensation to the defendant from the United States. The United States moved for judgment on the pleadings for the full amount claimed in the petition, without deduction of the counterclaims, and this motion was granted; the court holding it had no jurisdiction of suits against the United States under the Dent Act, like those presented as counterclaims herein, either as original actions or set-offs or counterclaims. Judgment was accordingly entered on the complaint for the United States in the sum of $15,286.72. Proceedings in error were prosecuted, and the Circuit Judge, acting as a District Judge, certified, conformably to Judicial Code,  238 ( Comp. St.  1215), that the jurisdiction of the court was in issue and that the order dismissing the set-offs or counterclaims was based solely upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to determine them.\n It was suggested at the hearing in this court that, as there was unquestioned jurisdiction of the suit by the United States under the first paragraph of section 24 of the Judicial Code, the case could not be brought directly from the District Court to this court on a certificate under section 238 of the Code as to the jurisdiction of the counterclaim. But we think that unquestioned jurisdiction over the complaint does not prevent a certificate as to jurisdiction \n\n[266 U.S. 101, 106]\n\u00a0\n of the new suit attempted in the form of a counterclaim. The question is not one as to the introduction of counterclaims as a mere matter of procedure. The objection to a suit against the United States is fundamental, whether it be in the form of an original action, or a set-off, or a counterclaim. Jurisdiction in either case does not exist, unless there is specific congressional authority for it. Nor is there doubt that the question is one which involves the jurisdiction of the District Court as a federal court under the statutes of the United States, for the jurisdiction of the District Court in this regard is wholly dependent on such statutes.\n The second question is whether such counterclaims as are averred in the answer are authorized by paragraph 26 of section 24 of the Judicial Code. That paragraph provides that the District Court of the United States shall have jurisdiction, concurrent with the Court of Claims, of all claims not exceeding $10,000 founded upon the Constitution of the United States or any law of Congress, or upon any regulation of an executive department, or upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect to which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States, either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were suable. It is argued that these counterclaims are each less than $10,000 in amount, and are founded on a law of Congress and upon a contract, express or implied, with the United States, and do not sound in tort, and therefore are within the power of the District Court to enforce them. The fatal objection to this argument is that these claims are based exclusively on the Dent Act (Act March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272, 1273). This act was passed to allow the Secretary of War to adjust and discharge any agreement entered into by any officer or agent acting under his \n\n[266 U.S. 101, 107]\n\u00a0\n authority or that of the President, during the emergency of the war, and prior to November 12, 1918, with any person, firm or corporation for the production, manufacture, or sale of equipment, materials, or supplies, or services connected with the prosecution of the war, when the agreement had been performed in whole or in part, or expenditures had been made or obligations incurred upon the faith of the same by such person, firm, or corporation prior to November 12th, and such agreement had not been executed in the manner prescribed by law. By section 2 of the act the Court of Claims is given jurisdiction on the petition of the claimant described in section 1 of the act to find and award fair and just compensation in such cases, if the claimant is not willing to accept the compensation offered by the Secretary of War. There is no other provision in the act for judicial action than this. This must be held to be an exclusive jurisdiction conferred upon the Court of Claims. This was the view of this court as shown in United States v. Pfitsch, \n256 \nU.S. 547, 553\n, 41 S. Ct. 569. In that case all the statutes which had been passed during the war giving jurisdiction to various courts of the United States for judicial settlement of controversies with the government, were considered and commented on, and among the four instances in which jurisdiction was said to be conferred only on the Court of Claims was the Dent Act. It is true that the question as to the operation of the Dent Act was not involved in the case. But the opinion, in throwing light upon the effect of section 10 of the Lever Act (Act Aug. 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 279 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8ii ]), providing for suits in the District Courts in controversies arising thereunder, made a careful comparison of all the acts of the kind and a classification of them. We see no reason to change our opinion as to the construction of the Dent Act in this regard. The defendant below placed itself squarely within the requirements of the Dent Act, and sought adjudication of its \n\n[266 U.S. 101, 108]\n\u00a0\n claims on the ground that the agreements under which recovery was sought had not been executed in the manner prescribed by law. In this way it put itself outside the field covered by paragraph 20 of section 24 of the Judicial Code, and by its own admission limited itself to the remedy possible under the Dent Act. It is unnecessary for us to consider therefore whether but for the Dent Act it might have brought suit under the general language contained in paragraph 20 of section 24. The effect of the Dent Act was to limit it to the Court of Claims. The District Court, therefore, was right in holding that it had no jurisdiction of the counterclaims and in giving judgment on the pleadings for the government.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL PAPER & TYPE CO. v.

It is engaged in New York in the business of exporting, which is defined to be the purchase of personal property within the United States, and the \n\n[266 U.S. 373, 374]\n\u00a0\n sale thereof without the United States, and has under the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227) been required to pay an income tax on its net income, part of which is derived from such foreign business.\n At the same time and times there were foreign corporations engaged in like business of buying personal property within the United States and exporting and selling it without the United States. Under sections 217 and 233 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  6336 1\/8 hh, 6336 1\/8 p) these corporations were wholly exempted from payment of the tax on the net income or profits accruing or derived from such business.\n On the 15th of March, 1922, the defendant (defendant in error here), being Collector of Internal Revenue, and acting as such, in pursuance of Sections 205 and 230 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923 ,  6336 1\/8 d, 6336 1\/8 nn) demanded of plaintiff the sum of $4,203.91, as due and payable from the plaintiff as one-fourth part of its income tax for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1921, that is, for the months of January, February, and March, 1921, and threatened to enforce payment of that sum together with penalties and interest thereon provided for by the laws of Congress.\n Plaintiff, on the 15th of March, 1922, solely to prevent distraint and sale of its property, and protesting that no tax was due, and that defendant was without authority to exact or collect the same or any part thereof, paid the tax.\n On or about the 6th of December, 1922, plaintiff, in accordance with law, made a claim in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and demanded the repayment of the tax on the ground that it was illegally assessed, that more than six months had expired since the filing of the claim for refund as provided for by section 1318 of the Revenue Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  5949, 5949a), and that no part of the claim had been remitted or repaid to plaintiff, or to any one, for its account. This action was then brought against the collector. \n\n[266 U.S. 373, 375]\n\u00a0\n Judgment was prayed for $3,999.08, the amount of the tax.\n Motion was made by the district attorney to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\n The motion was granted on the authority of and upon the reasoning of National Paper & Type Co. v. Edwards, Collector of Internal Revenue (D. C.) 292 Fed. 633. Judgment was formally entered dismissing the complaint upon the merits.\n To review this action and judgment, this writ of error is directed. The difference in treatment of domestic and foreign corporations in respect to business of sales in foreign countries, it is contended, is a 'hostile discrimination and confiscation of property.'\n To sustain the charge, plaintiff asserts that its business and that of foreign corporations is done under exactly the same circumstances and conditions and that the discrimination hence resulting offends the 'due process of law' provision of the Fifth Amendment. Cases are cited and the deduction from them is declared to be that 'our whole system of law is predicated on the general fundamental principle of equality of application of the law.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Here the discrimination, if such it can be called, is in favor of foreign corporations in respect to taxation of earnings from business done in foreign countries. Clearly as to such business Congress may adopt a policy calculated to serve the best interests of this country in dealing with citizens or subjects of another country, and may properly say that as to earnings from such business, the foreign subjects or citizens shall be left to the taxation of their own government or to that having jurisdiction of the sales. Even if we were to concede, as we cannot, that the Fifth Amendment in enjoining due process of law requires as part thereof equality of taxation, it certainly \n\n[266 U.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n could not be held to apply to a subject-matter not within this country.\n Regarding the purchase of articles of personal property within the United States and the mere fact of exportation therefrom, domestic and foreign corporations may be pronounced alike-may seem to be in the same relation to taxing legislation. But there is something else to consider, and its effect. There may be benefit in the inviting of foreign corporations into the United States-benefit in their investments and activities-and as counsel for the government points out, the domestic corporation gets the power of the United States to protect its interests and redress its wrongs in whatever part of the world its business may take it. And as the government further points out, the foreign corporation must look to the country of its origin for protection against injury and redress of losses occurring in that and other foreign countries, and not to the United States. The government, therefore, contends, and rightly contends, that domestic corporations are required to pay a tax on their incomes from all sources while foreign corporations are taxed only on their income from sources within the United States because, to repeat, only that income is earned under the protection of American laws.\n And we understand a further contention to be that the discrimination is the fact that makes the tax on plaintiff a direct burden on and impediment to its business of exporting, 'in violation of paragraph 5 of section 9 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that 'no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.\" The alleged discrimination is said in some way to emphasize and increase the violation of that paragraph of the Constitution.\n So far as the invocation of paragraph 5 depends upon discrimination, what we have said disposes of it; if it be independent of discrimination and based upon the fact \n\n[266 U.S. 373, 377]\n\u00a0\n of a tax upon exports, it is completely answered and disposed of adversely by Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, 38 S. Ct. 432, and needs no further comment.\n The difference in the legislation, we think, is constitutional and justified by the considerations which we have submitted. The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312\n, 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L.

West, of St. Louis, Mo., for New York Cent. R. Co.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Chicago, Ill., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to recover penalties prescribed by the Safety Appliance Acts. Act March 2, 1893, 27 Stat. 531, as amended April 1, 1896, 29 Stat. 85, and March 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 943 (Comp. St.  8605-8615). Judgment went in favor of the United States. The case was taken by defendant to the Circuit Court of Appeals on writ of error, and that court, under section 239 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1216), certified a question of law to this court. It is this:\n'May an interstate carrier lawfully operate a car equipped with power brakes past an available repair station to destination when its power brakes, becoming \n\n[265 U.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n out of order in transit, have been cut out of the power brake system of the train and when more than 85 per centum of the remaining1 cars of the train are equipped with power brakes controlled by the engineer of the locomotive?'\n\n On November 10, 1920, the train, which is mentioned in the first cause of action set forth in the complaint, was made up on defendant's railroad at Coalburg, Ohio. It consisted of 63 cars, all of which were equipped with air brakes and it was moved over the defendant's lines via Erie, Pa., to Buffalo, N. Y. All the air brakes and air brake appliances were in working order when the train left Coalburg, and were operated by the engineer on the locomotive. Some time after leaving Coalburg, the air brakes on three cars became defective, so that they could not be used. Because of the liability of such brakes to stick, and cause delay and damage to the train, the trainmen cut them out from their connection with the line of air hose by turning the cut-out cocks in the cross-over pipes. This made it impossible for the engineer to operate the brakes on these cars, but did not interfere with his use of the brakes on the 60 other cars. He did use and operate them independently of the defective brakes, and thereby controlled the speed of the train without requiring the brakemen to use the hand brakes for that purpose. The three cars with defective brakes were the tenth, fortieth, and forty-fourth cars in the train, counting from the head end. At Erie defendant had repair men and materials available for the repair of the defective brakes. The train was run past the repair station to Buffalo in the condition stated above. The train mentioned in the second cause of action had 80 cars, and the facts with respect to it are in substance the same as the foregoing. \n\n[265 U.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n The pertinent provisions of the acts of Congress are:\n'... It shall be unlawful for any common carrier ... to use ... any locomotive ... not equipped with a power driving-wheel brake and appliances for operating the train-brake system, or to run any train ... that has not a sufficient number of cars in it so equipped with power or train brakes that the engineer on the locomotive drawing such train can control its speed without requiring brakemen to use the common hand brake for that purpose.' Section 1, c. 196, Act March 2, 1893, 27 Stat. 531 (Comp. St.  8605).\n\n'... Whenever ... any train is operated with power or train brakes, not less than fifty per centum of the cars in such train shall have their brakes used and operated by the engineer of the locomotive drawing such train; and all power-braked cars in such train which are associated together with said fifty per centum shall have their brakes so used and operated. ...' Section 2, c. 976, Act March 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 943 (Comp. St.  8614).\n\n'... All cars must be equipped with ... efficient hand brakes . ...' Section 2, c. 160, Act April 14, 1910, 36 Stat. 298 (Comp. St.  8618).\n\n Penalties are prescribed by chapter 87, Act April 1, 1896, 29 Stat. 85 (Comp. St.  8610), and section 4, c. 160, Act April 14, 1910, 36 Stat. 298 (Comp. St.  8621).\n Pursuant to authority conferred upon it by the act of 1903, the Interstate Commerce Commission, November 15, 1905, ordered that the minimum prescribed by the act be increased to 75 per cent., and on June 6, 1910, ordered it increased to 85 per cent.\n Defendant contends that, within the meaning of section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1903, the cars having air brakes which were out of order were not 'power-braked cars' while in that condition, and that the law did not require their brakes to be operated by the engineer, as at all times power brakes on more than 85 per cent. of all the cars in the train were so operated.\n The acts of Congress and orders of the Commission above referred to should be liberally construed, to relieve \n\n[265 U.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n trainmen of the labor and danger involved in the use of hand brakes to control the speed of trains, and to promote the safety of trains and of persons and property thereon. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Voelker, 129 Fed. 522, 527, 65 C. C. A. 226, 70 L. R. A. 264; Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., \n196 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 158. It is the purpose, as soon as practicable, to require all cars to be equipped with power brakes. See In re Power or Train Brakes, 11 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 429. At the time in question, the requirements were that all cars be equipped with hand brakes, that at least 85 per cent. of all cars in any train be equipped with power brakes and operated by the engineer, and that all power-braked cars associated together with such minimum have their brakes so used and operated.\n Only two classes of cars are contemplated by the act-those equipped with hand brakes and power brakes, and those equipped with hand brakes only. When the train started from Coalburg, undeniably all were then 'power-braked cars.' The failure of the brakes to work did not take the cars out of that class.\n Hand-braked cars lawfully may be hauled in trains having the prescribed number of cars equipped with power brakes operated by the engineer. The law does not require that the brakes on all power-braked cars in the train shall be so operated. See Lyon v. Railway, 77 S. C. 328, 339, 58 S. E. 12; United States v. Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Co., 247 Fed. 49, 51, 159 C. C. A. 267; United States v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. ( D. C.) 176 Fed. 114, 119. It does not require the extra switching which would be necessary to associate together all power-braked cars in the train, and some of them may be separated from the prescribed minimum by hand-braked cars. See In re Power or Train-Brakes, supra. Hand-braked cars have no air line, and it is necessary that they be placed in the train to the rear of the power-braked cars making up the prescribed minimum. The cars having power brakes which became defective and were cut out \n\n[265 U.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n formed a part of the air line and were located at intervals in the train. The air line through each of these cars was used to operate brakes on other cars after as well as before the cut-out cocks were turned. Clearly they were associated together with the other cars equipped with power brakes. The act specifically requires that all power-braked cars so associated shall have their brakes used and operated by the engineer. Defendant's contention would permit the hauling, in association with cars having their power brakes operated by the engineer, of 15 per cent. of the cars in a train with power brakes in bad order and cut out. This would nullify the provision of section 2 of the act of 1903. It must be held that the running of the train from Erie to Buffalo in the condition above described was a violation of the law. See Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, 241 Fed. 824, 830, 154 C. C. A. 526; Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, 223 Fed. 748, 139 C. C. A. 278; United States v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 229 Fed. 927, 144 C. C. A. 209.2\n The unlawfulness of the operation resulted from the association in the air line of cars having defective brakes with cars having brakes operated by the engineer. The cutting out of the defective brakes, leaving the cars on the air line, did not terminate the association. While on the air line having their brakes cut out, such cars are to be distinguished from hand-braked cars. Because they have no power line, it is impossible, within the meaning of the act, to associate hand-braked cars with cars equipped with power brakes operated by the engineer. And, when not a part of the air line, power-braked cars whose brakes will not work are not so associated. When placed to the rear of the cars having their brakes operated by the engineer, the air line on such cars cannot be used to operate any brakes on the train. Having inoperative brakes and being so located, they are not associated with the prescribed \n\n[265 U.S. 41, 47]\n\u00a0\n minimum; and section 2 of the act of 1903 does not require that they shall have their brakes operated by the engineer. The question whether it was a violation of law to haul defective cars to Erie, the place of the first repair station, while associated in the train with the prescribed minimum, is not involved in this case, and we express no opinion upon it.\n The answer to the question certified is:\n No, unless placed in the train to the rear of all cars having their brakes operated by the engineer. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The question is considered as if the word 'remaining' were stricken out. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf.

Murphy and William L. Visscher, both of Albany, N. Y., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[265 U.S. 379, 382]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. Clarence Aiken, of Albany, N. Y., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case, which was heard with Sheehan Co. v. Shuler, \n265 U.S. 371\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 548, 68 L. Ed. --, No. 593, just decided likewise involves the question of the constitutionality of the amendment to the Workmen's Compensation Law of New York relating to the creation of a special fund for the maintenance of employees undergoing vocational rehabilitation.\n The only difference between the two cases in this respect is that the present case arose under the Laws of 1920, c. 760,  1, by which the amendment (then constituting subdivision 8 of section 15 of the Compensation Law), required the employer to pay the sum of $900 to this special fund, while the Sheehan Co. Case arose under the Laws of 1922, c. 615, by which the amendment (changed to subdivision 9) reduced the required payment to $500.1 The provisions are otherwise identical.\n In March, 1921, an employee of the New York State Railways sustained, in the course of his employment, accidental injuries resulting in his death. He left no survivors entitled to compensation. The State Industrial Board, in an appropriate proceeding awarded the State \n\n[265 U.S. 379, 383]\n\u00a0\n Treasurer against the Railways, a 'self-insurer,' the sum of $100, under subdivision 7 (now 8)2 of section 15 for the total disability fund, and the sum of $900, under subdivision 8 (now 9), for the rehabilitation fund. The Railways did not appeal from the award under subdivision 7. On successive appeals the award under subdivision 8 was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, without opinions. McNamara v. N. Y. State Railway, 202 App. Div. 768, 194 N. Y. Supp. 955; Id. 233 N. Y. 681, 135 N. E. 968. The record was remitted to the Supreme Court; to which this writ of error was directed.\n The Railways contend, as did the plaintiffs in error in the Sheehan Company Case, that subdivision 8 (now 9) of the Compensation Law and the award made thereunder, are in conflict with the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n This case is governed by the decision in the Sheehan Company Case. The difference in the amount of the required payment to the rehabilitation fund does not change the result. The amount required under the amendment of 1920 was neither unjust nor unreasonable. 'The sum fixed in the statute is not great, is not larger than could readily be awarded, had the deceased left dependents. There is no evidence ... that the sum fixed is so extravagant or arbitrary as to constitute an abuse of power.' Watkinson v. Hotel Pennsylvania, 195 App. Div. 624, 627, 187 N. Y. Supp. 278, 281. And the aggregate of the required payments to the two special funds was then the same as that subsequently required under the amendments of 1922; \n\n[265 U.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n there being merely a different apportionment between the two funds.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See the opinion in the Sheehan Company Case, note 6. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This subdivision then required the employer, under the Laws of 1916, c. 622, to pay into the total disability fund, in the specified contingency, the sum of $100; the amount being subsequently increased, under the Laws of 1922, c. 615, to $500.

Eastburn, of Wilmington, Del., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Caleb S. Layton and Reuben Satterthwaite, Jr., both of Wilmington, Del., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the collector of taxes, the defendant in error, to recover taxes due to the City of Wilmington for the years 1913 to and through 1918. The defendant Telegraph Company, the plaintiff in error, demurred to the declaration on the ground that the statute imposing the taxes deprived it of its property without due process of law and denied to it the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The demurrer was overruled and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff by the Superior Court and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 121 Atl. 18.\n The statute in question is an Act of April 7, 1913 (27 Del. Laws, c. 205,  1) amending section 80 of the charter of the City of Wilmington. It authorizes an assessment of telegraph lines in the city at not less than six thousand and six hundred dollars and not more than seven thousand three hundred dollars for each mile of the streets used. The rate of taxation on these sums is the same as that for other taxes and neither that nor the modes of determining the amount between the limits fixed is complained of. But it is argued that this is a property tax upon the company's poles and lines, and that it fixes an arbitrary valuation upon them without giving the Company a chance to be heard at any time before the tax is levied. It is argued further that the Company is denied the equal protection of the laws when it and a few others are singled \n\n[265 U.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n out and other Delaware property is valued on the actual facts.\n The State Court met this argument by holding that the tax was a license or privilege tax and therefore not open to the objections urged. The Company answers that this is characterization of the statute not construction, and that upon the issue of constitutionality this Court must determine the nature of the tax for itself and is not bound by the name given to it below. St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346, 348\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 125. The proposition is true, but when the State Court after a candid discussion that manifests no disposition to escape constitutional limits, has come to the conclusion reached here we should be slow to differ from it upon a matter having so many purely local elements even if we did not think it right, as we do. Clyde v. Gilchrist, \n262 \nU.S. 94, 97\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 501.\n The Company is a Delaware corporation and there is no doubt that the State may impose the present tax if it has not used a wrong form of words in doing it. It might impose it as a condition of the grant of the franchise enjoyed by the corporation. It might authorize Wilmington to impose it for the privilege of occupying the streets. The State Court relies mainly on the latter ground. We shall not repeat the arguments of that Court drawn from the history of the legislation concerned and the fact that the last preceding form of this section was admitted to lay a privilege tax. It is enough to refer to its further argument that the valuation expressed in the act is not a valuation of the Company's property, which the Company says is worth only about $500 a mile, but a valuation of the privilege granted. The statute does not tax by the poles, the Company's property, but by the mile, the measure of occupation of the streets. Underground wires are worth more and are taxes less. The supposed discrimination is based upon the same grounds. Telegraph \n\n[265 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n companies occupy the streets with their poles and may be required to pay for it. Therefore we have no need to decide how far the State might go in discouraging some particular activity, if so minded, by taxes as well as by penalties. Hammond Packing Co. v. Montana, \n233 U.S. 331\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 596. Neither shall we consider how far a legislature may go when it deals with specified lands. Vallev Farm Co. v. West Chester, \n261 U.S. 155\n, 43 Sup.

OF NEW YORK(1924)\nNo. 565\nArgued: Decided: May 12, 1924\n\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 78, 80]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an equitable action to enjoin the continued enforcement of chapter 125 of the Laws of New York of 1906, which fixed at 80 cents a thousand feet the price at which gas was to be furnished to private consumers in the various boroughs in the city of New York, on the ground that the rate was confiscatory and violated the rights of the company under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution.\n The main controversy was settled in favor of the company by this court in March, 1922. \n258 U.S. 165\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 264. Upon another appeal, we directed a reduction of the master's fees by $28,750. \n259 U.S. 101\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 438. When the case reached the District Court (consolidated Gas Co. of New York v. Newton, 291 Fed. 704) for further proceedings, the defendants made a motion to retax costs, objecting to half a dozen items charged. The court allowed certain exceptions, but overruled others. The only one overruled, and here insisted on, is for $76,086.50 for premiums paid by the company to surety companies for bonds securing the repayment of a large amount of money impounded with the special master.\n When the District Court found that a rate of 80 cents was confiscatory, it granted an injunction to prevent the Attorney General of the state, the district attorney of New York county, and the Public Service Commission from enforcing such a rate, but as a condition of such injunction it required the company to impound with a special master all sums charged for gas to consumers over and above the 80-cent rate until the issue could be finally settled in this court. This court, although it found error in certain other limitations of the order, held that so much of it was within the court's discretion. \n258 U.S. 165\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 264. The plaintiff, after the order of impounding \n\n[265 U.S. 78, 81]\n\u00a0\n was made, secured leave from the court to substitute the surety bonds in lieu of cash. Consolidated Gas Co. of New York v. Newton, 267 Fed. 231. In granting this leave, the District Judge said:\n'The plaintiff urges with force, I think, that to impound all the moneys over 80 cents for a period perhaps of a year will cause loss both to itself and to the consumers. It suggests that it have the right to substitute adequate securities. The best that the special master can get on the deposits is probably 3 1\/4 per cent.; the plaintiff, if required to finance its temporary requirements, must pay much more-it says 14 per cent. In any case it will sustain a loss which will profit no one but the banks, so far as appears. I see no advantage in insisting upon impounding the moneys, if adequate security can be otherwise provided.'\n\n The bonds were required to secure, not only the cash for which they were substituted, but interest at 7 per cent. to become part of the fund. The court continued:\n'I have required a substantial rate of interest, because the plaintiff will be in effect using the consumers' money. On the one hand, the consumer profits by getting more than he could from the banks; on the other, the plaintiff profits by being relieved from high rates of interest. The rate at which the plaintiff has sold its bonds is 7 per cent. and on short financing the rates are much higher. I think that 7 per cent. should be the rate, even though the plaintiff must pay a premium to get the bond; it will recover back all that the consumers are not eventually entitled to.'\n\n From the final decree of the District Court, fixing the costs, an appeal was taken to this court. To that appeal the Public Service Commission of New York, as defendant in the suit, was not made a party, and no summons and severance was issued against it. \n264 U.S. 571\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 401, 68 L. Ed. --. Accordingly the \n\n[265 U.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n appeal was dismissed in the following per curiam:\n'Dismissed for want of jurisdiction, upon authority of Masterson v.

Vela, \n216 U.S. 598\n, 601.'\n\n Upon a petition for rehearing the appellants bring to the knowledge of this court that by chapter 134 of the Laws of 1921 the Public Service Commission for the First District, which was here concerned, was abolished, and that therefore the appellants were not required by summons and severance to exclude from the future capacity to appeal, a defunct state board originally joined with them as a codefendant. Mercantile Trust Co. v. Kanawha & Ohio Ry. Co., 58 Fed. 6, 14, 7 C. C. A. 3. We think the abolition of the Public Service Commission made it unnecessary to make it a party to this appeal, and that the dismissal heretofore entered for lack of service of a summons and severance upon it should be set aside.\n The appellee insists that the appeal must be dismissed, first, because it is not from a final decree; and, second, because no appeal lies from a decree for costs alone.\n First. If the subject-matter is appealable at all, there would seem to be no doubt that the decree has all the characteristics of finality. An execution can issue at once to collect the costs as taxed, including the item here complained of. Trustees v. Greenough, \n105 U.S. 527\n; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., Petitioner, \n129 U.S. 206\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 265; In re Michigan Central R. Co., 124 Fed. 727, 731, 59 C. C. A. 643.\n Second. Is the order of the District Court for this controverted item appealable? There is no doubt that, as a general rule, an appeal does not lie from a decree solely for costs, and, if an appeal on the merits be taken and affirmed, it will not be reversed on a question of costs. Canter v. American Insurance Co., 3 Pet. 307, 319; Elastic Fabrics Co. v. Smith, \n100 U.S. 110\n, 112; Paper Bag \n\n[265 U.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n Cases, \n105 U.S. 766\n, 772; City Bank of Fort Worth v. Hunter, \n152 \nU.S. 512, 516\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 675; Stuart v. Boulware, \n133 U.S. 78\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 242; Du Bois v. Kirk, \n158 \nU.S. 58, 67\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 729; Citizens' Bank v. Cannon, \n164 \nU.S. 319, 323\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 89; Wingert v. First National Bank, \n223 \nU.S. 670, 672\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 391.\n Questions of costs in admiralty and equity are discretionary, and the action of the court is presumptively correct. United States v. Brig Malek Adhel, 2 How. 210, 237; The Scottland, \n118 \nU.S. 507, 519\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 1174. The allowance of costs in the federal courts rests, not upon express statutory enactment by Congress, but upon usage long continued and confirmed by implication from provisions in many statutes. Ex parte Peterson, \n253 \nU.S. 300, 316\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 543. And see Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & B. Bridge Co., 18 How. 460.\n The rule forbidding appeals from decrees for costs only is easily deducible from the discretion vested in the trial court in fixing them and the better opportunity of that court to exercise that discretion from its greater intimacy with details of the pleadings, hearings, and orders in the case. When the power of the court to assess costs against either party is not in dispute, or the mere amount to be fixed is in issue, appeals on such questions alone are not allowed. But the rule is not absolute, and should not be enforced when the trial court assumes the power to assess as costs against a fund or a party expenditures of a class not legally assessable as such. Where a question of this kind is made, appeals have been allowed. Thus in Trustees v. Greenough, \n105 U.S. 527\n, an appeal was allowed from a decree in equity solely for costs, when the question was whether they could be properly paid out of a fund in the control of the court. So in Re Michigan Central Railroad Co., 124 Fed. 727, 59 C. C. A. 643, an intervener was allowed to appeal from a decree of a trial court, allowing costs in favor of the clerk, when it was objected that neither by statute nor general law could such costs be \n\n[265 U.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n allowed by the court in favor of the clerk. The question is fully considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit in an opinion by Judge Lurton, afterwards Mr. Justice Lurton, of this court. The many cases cited in which appeals from decrees for costs had been denied were distinguished, as involving a question, not of positive law, but of discretion. We think the distinction made in that case a sound one, and that, as the question is here presented, the appeal is a proper one.\n The question is whether premiums for bonds, paid by a party litigant to preserve his rights and save him from loss under the orders of court pending the litigation, can be taxed as costs against the defeated party. There has been considerable difference of opinion among the District Courts and the Circuit Courts of Appeals on this subject. This court has never considered it. The South Portland (D. C.) 95 Fed. 295; Jacobsen v. Lewis Klondike Expedition Co. (C. C. A. Ninth Circuit) 112 Fed. 73, 50 C. C. A. 121; Edison v. Mutoscope Co. (C. C.) 117 Fed. 192; The John D. Dailey (D.

C.) 183 Fed. 990; The Europe (C. C. A. Ninth Circuit) 190 Fed. 475, 481, 111 C. C. A. 307-are cases in which, either by rule of court or through usage, such costs have been taxed in admiralty cases or equity causes. In Lee Injector Mfg. Co. v. Penberthy Injector Co. (C. C. A. Sixth Circuit) 109 Fed. 964, 48 C. C. A. 760; The Governor Ames (C. C. A. First Circuit) 187 Fed. 40, 48, 109 C. C. A. 94; The Texas (C. C. A. Third Circuit) 226 Fed. 897, 905, 141 C. C. A. 501; Parkerson v. Borst (C. C. A. Fifth Circuit) 256 Fed. 827, 168 C. C. A. 173; In re Hoyt (D. C.) 119 Fed. 987, and in The Willowdene ( D. C.) 97 Fed. 509, it is held that where the disbursement is not made as the result of any rule of practice, and there is no statute, rule, or usage by which it is made a part of the taxable costs of the case, it cannot be allowed. In \n\n[265 U.S. 78, 85]\n\u00a0\n The Texas, supra, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit, after expressing its approval of the view that a rule of court or a practice equivalent thereto is necessary to justify the taxation of such costs, said:\n'But we may also say that we think such a rule or practice has become so desirable that we feel confident the court below will take an early opportunity to conform its procedure in this respect to the custom prevailing in other districts.'\n\n The District Judge, in passing on the issue, said that it had been the custom in the Second circuit to allow as costs premiums on stipulations given to release vessels from arrest, citing The Volund, supra; The Hurstdale, supra; The John D. Dailey, supra; that Judge Lacombe, in Edison v. Mutoscope Co., supra, had allowed as costs premiums upon a supersedeas bond in an equity case; and that there had been a uniform usage for the 14 years during which he had sat in that district to allow such items.\n We think that, under the usage thus shown in the Second Circuit, the District Court, had power to assess these premiums as costs in this suit in equity. It is apparent from the circumstances already set forth that the order made by the District Court, under which these bonds were secured and substituted for cash, was not only in the interest of the company, but of the consumers in whose behalf the defendants below were contending. Had the state authorities prevailed in this court, they would have secured from the surety companies on these bonds, for distribution among the customers, not only the amount of money impounded, but also 7 per cent. interest thereon, to compensate them for the taking of their money and the delay in its return. As the cause went against them, it was not an abuse of discretion to hold that the defendants, who have conducted the litigation and lost, should pay the costs of an arrangement made in their interest, because of an expense with which the company \n\n[265 U.S. 78, 86]\n\u00a0\n had been unjustly burdened. It may be that, in a circuit and district where no usage or rule of court exists, such costs may not be taxed. We are not called upon to decide that. It is enough, that we may decide this appeal, to hold that it was not an abuse of discretion or a violation of law for the District Court in the Second Circuit to allow the item.\n By the Act of August 13, 1894 (chapter 282, 28 Stat. 279 [Comp. St.  3293-3300]), Congress has made elaborate provision for the safe use of surety companies as security upon bonds required in court and other proceedings, and, while it does not exclude individual sureties, it offers a most convenient and stable means of obtaining indemnity against the default of parties. This is much to be preferred to individual sureties, because a properly conducted surety company makes it its business promptly to investigate and to meet its liabilities. Acceptance of the service of such companies is, of course, upon the basis of a regular rate of compensation, and where a party litigant has, because of the claim of the opposing party, been compelled to furnish such security, and it turns out that it was wrongly required, a rule of court or usage which imposes the expense of the security on the defeated party is not unreasonable.\n The decree of the District Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORFOLK & W R. CO. v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF WEST VIRGINIA(1924)\nNo. 187\nArgued: January 21, 1924Decided: May 5, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 70, 71]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John H. Holt, of Huntington, W. Va., Theodore W. Reath, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Lucian H. Cocke, of Roanoke, Va., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Randolph Bias, of Williamson, W. Va., and F. M. Livezey, of Huntington, W. Va., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n John Followay, one of the defendants in error, a merchant at a village called Blackberry City, in Mingo county, W. Va., filed complaint with the Public Service Commission of that state, praying that the Norfolk & Western Railway Company, plaintiff in error, be required to furnish a suitable crossing and to provide reasonable facilities for the use of shippers at that place. After a hearing, at which much evidence was introduced, the commission made an order which directed the railway company to construct and maintain a roadway for vehicles across its tracks at McCarr Siding. It limited the use of the crossing to the transportation of freight consigned to the complainant and other shippers, and required that the entrance to the crossing at the north side of the track be closed by a gate to be furnished by complainant and to be by him kept locked, except when the crossing was being so used, and directed that, while the crossing was being used by complainant for the transportation of goods across the tracks in vehicles, he should provide a watchman to give notice of approaching trains.\n The company instituted proceedings in the Supreme Court of Appeals to suspend and set aside the order, and \n\n[265 U.S. 70, 72]\n\u00a0\n there contended that it was repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The contention was overruled, and the order was affirmed. Railway Co. v. Public Service Commission, 91 W. Va. 414, 113 S. E. 247. Plaintiff in error seeks to have the judgment reversed on the ground of such repugnancy.\n It is provided by statute that every railroad company may be required by the commission to establish and maintain such suitable public facilities and conveniences as may be reasonable and just. Section 4, c. 15O, Barnes' Code 1918; Railway Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, 419, 113 S. E. 247.\n The facts may be briefly stated. At McCarr Siding there are four parallel tracks-an eastbound main line, a westbound main line, a track between these, and a branch line extending across the Tug river. There is also a spur track extending southeasterly from the main line tracks to the tipple of the Allburn Coal Corporation and intersecting the approach to the proposed crossing about 200 feet therefrom.\n The railroad tracks are on the north bank of the Tug river which at this place is the boundary between West Virginia and Kentucky. The village adjoins the company's right of way on the north and is located on a bluff considerably higher than the railroad tracks. Its population is about 100. Complainant's store is on a hillside a short distance north of the tracks. The Allburn Coal Corporation owns a double-decked bridge across the river almost directly opposite the store. The upper level of the bridge is used for transportation of coal, and the lower level is used for pedestrian and vehicular travel. Though privately owned, it has been used by the public for a number of years as a part of the traveled way between the village and the territory south of the river. By reason of a sharp curve in the tracks and a deep cut, the \n\n[265 U.S. 70, 73]\n\u00a0\n view of the crossing is obstructed, so that enginemen on approaching trains can see it for only a short distance.\n McCarr Siding was established for the accommodation of the Allburn Coal Company about 10 or 12 years prior to the filing of the complaint. The tariffs of the railway company and its shipping instructions state that the siding is a carload billing point. It is also a prepay station, to which freight in carload and less than carload lots may be shipped, to be delivered at the risk of consignees. The coal company and complainant receive by far the larger part of the freight. The amount received by others is small. When the mines of the Allburn Coal Corporation are fully operated, 8 or 10 carloads of coal are loaded daily. Other outgoing shipments, consisting principally of boxes, containers, and household goods, are also made. The siding is a flag station for three passenger trains, two eastbound and one westbound daily. For that purpose it serves about 1,000 people living in the vicinity, including many on the Kentucky side of the river. From 10 to 30 people get on and off trains at McCarr daily. Mail for the village is carried by railroad and delivered at the siding.\n Complainant has been engaged in business in the village for many years. He handles merchandise in substantial volume. His freight bill amounts to about $300 a month. The goods come in less than carload and in carload lots, and are delivered by the company at the siding. Most of them are brought from the west. Less than carload lots are deposited by the company on the ground on the south side of the tracks opposite his place of business, and carloads are delivered at approximately the same place. It is necessary for him to move his freight across the four intervening tracks. No station facilities have ever been furnished at the siding, and the commission found that the company's failure to afford reasonable facilities for the removal of complainant's freight \n\n[265 U.S. 70, 74]\n\u00a0\n from its premises causes him damage, delay, and inconvenience.\n Because of the danger attending the use of the crossing, the railway company, shortly before the commencement of these proceedings, planted posts about 5 feet apart for a distance of about 50 feet along the right of way on the north side of its tracks to obstruct the crossing and prevent its use for vehicular traffic. This compelled complainant to carry the freight consigned to him by hand across the tracks at a cost greatly in excess of the expense of hauling it in vehicles.\n The state, in the exercise of its police power, directly or through an authorized commission, may require railroad carriers to provide reasonably adequate and suitable facilities for the convenience of the communities served by them. But its power to regulate is not unlimited. It may not unnecessarily or arbitrarily trammel or interfere with the operation and conduct of railroad properties and business. Mississippi Railroad Commission v. Mobile & Ohio R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 388, 390\n, 391 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 602. The validity of regulatory measures may be challenged on the ground that they transgress the Constitution, and thereupon it becomes the duty of the court, in the light of the facts in the case, to determine whether the regulation is reasonable and valid or essentially unreasonable, arbitrary and void. Wisconsin, Minnesota & Pacific Railroad v. Jacobson, \n179 \nU.S. 287, 297\n, 301 S., 21 Sup. Ct. 115; Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, \n264 U.S. 504\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 412, 68 L. Ed. --. Railroad carriers may be compelled by state legislation to establish stations at proper places for the convenience of their patrons. Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n193 \nU.S. 53, 63\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 396. Any measure promulgated by the state to require a railroad company to provide suitable facilities reasonably necessary for the removal from its premises of freight carried by it for its customers does not create a new duty or impose any unnecessary burden. \n\n[265 U.S. 70, 75]\n\u00a0\n The facts in this case clearly show the need of some facilities at McCarr Siding for the use of the patrons of the railroad. The order directing the company to construct and maintain a crossing for the use of vehicles to haul the freight across the tracks is a light burden upon the carrier and cannot be said to be unreasonable and arbitrary. It need not be considered whether the company, in the interest of the safety of those using the crossing, lawfully might have been required to furnish the gate and provide the watchman.\n To support its contention that the order is unconstitutional, the company asserts that the order takes from it and gives to complainant the control of the crossing; that it prevents the use of the crossing without the consent and participation of complainant, and compels the company to enter into an arrangement or agreement with complainant making him its agent to control the use of the crossing and to guard it while being used. These contentions are without merit. The order does not impair or interfere with the company's right to permit the crossing to be used for purposes other than those specified in the order or prevent the company from guarding the crossing by watchmen or otherwise as it sees fit. Manifestly the limitation upon the use of the crossing and the imposition of duties on the complainant in respect of the gate and the guarding of the crossing were for the benefit of the company. The effect of these provisions was to relieve the carrier of a part of the burden and expense of providing facilities deemed reasonable and necessary for the removal of freight consigned to complainant and others at the siding. We find nothing in the order that deprives the company of its property without due process of law or denies to it the equal protection of the laws.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNYANZA S S CO. v.

Montgomery, of New Orleans, La., for appellant.\n Mr. Walter Carroll, of New Orleans, La., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The owners of the steamship Nyanza filed in the federal court for Eastern Louisiana, against Jahncke Dry Dock No. 1 and the owners thereof a single libel, setting forth these four causes of action: In rem for salvage, in personam for salvage, in rem for damage from collision, and in personam for such damage. The owners appeared as claimants. Excepting to the libel, they prayed that, 'in so far as the action is either in rem or in personam for salvage and in rem for damage,' it be dismissed for want of admiralty jurisdiction. The court maintained the exception, entered a decree of dismissal precisely as prayed for, and allowed an appeal under section 238 of the Judicial \n\n[264 U.S. 439, 440]\n\u00a0\n Code (Comp. St.  1215), with a certificate that 'in this decree the question of jurisdiction alone is in issue.'\n The decree leaves the cause of action in personam for damage undisposed of. For this reason the appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court, although the objection was not taken by the appellee. This court has jurisdiction under section 238, as under others, only of writs of error or appeals from final judgments. And the judgment must be, not only in its nature final, but a complete disposition of the cause. Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 347.

Greacen, both of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Jerome S. Hess, of New York City, and George F. Snyder, of Washington, D.

Service was made by attaching tangible personal property and credits within the state alleged to belong to the defendants and summons. In the state court, the government of Mexico, appearing specially, moved seasonably that the attachment be quashed and that the suit be dismissed. Before the motion was heard, the case was removed on its petition to the federal court for southern New York. There Mexico, again appearing specially, procured a rule that the plaintiff show cause why the attachment should not be vacated and the suit dismissed, upon the ground that it is 'an independent sovereign nation, ... immune from process of the courts, except upon its consent.' \n\n[264 U.S. 440, 442]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff asserted that, at the time when the suit was begun and when the rule was returnable, Mexico had not been recognized by our government, and contended that, being a nonrecognized foreign government, it was suable as a foreign corporation under subdivision 7 of section 7 of the Civil Practice Act of New York. It was conceded that National Railways of Mexico is merely a name for the system of railroads controlled and operated by the Mexican government. After the hearing on the motion, but before entry of the judgment below, Mexico was duly recognized by the United States and diplomatic relations between the two governments were resumed. Thereupon, and solely upon this ground, the District Court held that Mexico was entitled to immunity from suit in the courts of the United States of America, unless upon its own consent, granted the motion to vacate the attachment and dismiss the suit, and issued the certificate of a jurisdictional question provided for in section 238 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1215). Here, the defendant in error moves to dismiss this writ of error for want of jurisdiction in this court, on the ground that the case below did not present the question of jurisdiction of the District Court as a federal court.\n The fact that the District Judge issued the certificate does not relieve this court from the duty of determining for itself whether the question which was certified is in truth one of the jurisdiction of the lower court as a federal court.

Bosley, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\n Mr. R. M. Searls, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 403, 405]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Since 1905 appellant has been the sole producer and general distributor of heating and illuminating gas in the San Francisco district. By three separate ordinances passed in June of 1913, 1914, and 1915, the board of supervisors directed it to supply such gas during the fiscal year commencing July 1st thereafter at not more than 75 cents per 1,000 feet. Claiming that the rate so prescribed would not yield fair return, appellant brought suits in July, 1913, 1914, and 1915, to prevent enforcement of the respective ordinances. Restraining orders issued upon condition that monthly statements should show each consumer's account, and bond should be given to secure proper repayments, with interest. The maximum rate in the schedule thereafter maintained was 85 cents per 1,000.\n December 15, 1916, the causes were consolidated and referred to a master. After taking much testimony he presented an elaborate report, March 2, 1920, which recommended dismissal of the bills and repayment of whatever had been collected above the prescribed rate. The District Court affirmed the report and directed an appropriate decree.\n The master found that not less than 7 per centum net upon the value of the property devoted to public use was necessary for a fair return; also that, if observed, the prescribed rate would have yielded more than 7 per centum-for 1913-1914, an excess of $21,402.95; for 1914-1915, $89,446. 12; and for 1915-1916, $171,464.48.\n We think the evidence supports the finding that a net return of 7 per centum was necessary in order to avoid confiscation.\n The inventory of the many items making up appellant's manufacturing and distributing plant with their reproduction \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 406]\n\u00a0\n cost new was agreed upon by the parties. In order to determine accrued depreciation and ascertain true values during the years 1913-1916, the master applied the 'modified sinking fund method.' Concerning this he said:\n It involves 'an estimate of the lives of the different structural units, and an annual allowance set aside from the rates received as a reserve for future replacement on a 5 per cent. compound interest curve, the capital basis of return to the owner being depreciated each year in an amount exactly corresponding with yearly additions to the reserve. It is assumed that loss of plant units by obsolescence and inadequacy, as well as by physical decay, can be forecast with substantial accuracy and provided for in advance of abandonment and replacement.'\n Appellant objects to the application of this method and insists that depreciation should have been ascertained upon full consideration of the definite testimony given by competent experts who examined the structural units, spoke concerning observed conditions and made estimates therefrom. As these examinations were made subsequent to the alleged depreciation for the definite purpose of ascertaining existing facts, we think the criticism is not without merit. Facts shown by reliable evidence were preferable to averages based upon assumed probabilities. When a plant has been conducted with unusual skill, the owner may justly claim the consequent benefits. The problem was to ascertain the probable result of the specified rate, if applied under well-known past conditions, not to forecast the probable outcome of a proposed rate under unknown future conditions.\n Counsel do not insist that the estimated accrued depreciation is 'grossly excessive,' if confined to the result of physical causes. But they do maintain that the master should have ascertained and stated what depreciation was due to such causes and how much followed obsolescence \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n resulting from the introduction of certain patented inventions, and we think such a finding should have been made unless some undisclosed reason prevented. The claim is that, in order to lower cost of production, it became necessary to abandon certain valuable property under conditions not reasonably susceptible of anticipation. The material and relevant facts ought to be disclosed.\n The objection to the report most seriously urged is that in his estimate of total value the master failed properly to appraise certain patent rights through which manufacturing costs had been greatly reduced; also that he failed to make proper allowances for the successful use of such rights. This objection is well taken. The following excerpts from the master's long and rather involved report disclose the contested points with the relevant facts and indicate his conclusions:\n'The company contends that its plant capital, as a basis of earnings, should suffer no deduction because of supposed depreciation due to age, but only, if at all, by the amount of 'deferred maintenance.' And where, as here, there have been abandonments of large units due to obsolescence, the loss should be reimbursed by amortization over a period of years after, rather than before, the replacement, this amortization being effected by dividing the economies resulting from new machines and processes between owner and consumer, thus allowing a partial reduction in the rate. ...\n\n'Until this case it had not occurred to me that, so far as theory is concerned, reimbursement of the owner could take place after abandonment. It would not seem fair if it involved a raise of rates. Physical depreciation, for example, if an accumulation is necessary to provide for replacement, ought to be provided beforehand from the rates of users of the service which caused the machine to wear out. But where replacement is made on account of obsolescence or inadequacy and economy is effected in \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n costs, that economy can with fairness be devoted to reimbursement for the replacement cost, the rates remaining unchanged. I know of no well-considered method to meet this reimbursement after the fact. The installments would have to include interest on the unpaid principal and capital would thus not be depreciated for purposes of return. An estimate of the period of amortization would not have to be made if all economies of the new machine were devoted to the amortization; it would work itself out. If the economies were shared with the rate payer, as plaintiff here suggests, the period should not extend beyond the estimated life of the new machine; a plan which is subject to the objection on the grounds of uncertainty common to all such estimates. ...\n\n'But where, as here, and as is generally the case, there is nothing to show what, if any, consideration has been given the question of depreciation methods by the state authorities, or anything beyond a bare schedule of rates to be charged, then the court must determine the proper methods by its own independent judgment. I have tried to make it clear that in the usual case the modified sinking fund method would seem most applicable. Notwithstanding this, in cases where it had not been the practice to accumulate a reserve, and where the cost of replacements has shown itself to be a fairly uniform amount, or a fairly uniform percentage of income or of capital, then there is no objection in sound reasoning, nor, as I believe, in the law as laid down, why the court should not adopt a replacement method in determining proper costs of production; and in such event it would rate at replacement cost new to determine the owner's reasonable return and include actual average replacement requirements in the yearly costs, without reserves. Or it might figure on a reserve for part of the plant, and a replacement method for the balance apparently adapted to it. Conceivably, also, the court might amortize the loss by obsolescence \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n after abandonment had taken place, as plaintiff urges here. But I imagine that any court will feel the same hesitation in so doing that I feel here, for it involves reimbursement as to structures no longer in the inventory of units in service, and is without precedent except where the rate-fixing body has laid it down as a proper policy. ...\n\n'Mr. E. C. Jones, chief gas engineer of plaintiff, also testified that the plant was worth cost new less only the deferred maintenance and the amount of abandonments immediately in prospect. He estimates the amount of this deduction at $828,916.41 (Exhibit 43), or 6.3 per cent. of his appraisement at $13,066,201.55 (Exhibit 3). His estimate includes no consideration of approaching obsolescence; it does include replacement reasonably in view, due to physical deterioration and to ordinary inadequacy. ...\n\n'I have referred several times to plaintiff's contention that obsolescence should be amortized after rather than before abandonment of a unit of plant. Specifically applied, it is urged that when it is seen that Martin station or other obsolete generator has been superseded by new Jones generators, using the improved Jones process for oil gas, the demonstrated economies thereby effected are justly to be devoted to reimbursing the company for the loss of capital occasioned by the obsolescence, continuing each year until the loss is made good, with interest. On this settled program the new generator would, of course, be rated for return at replacement cost new at all times. To give the consumer a part of the advantages of the improvement, the company proposes that only half of the very considerable economies of operation shall be devoted to its reimbursement. Many advantages are urged for this plan: That it throws upon the consumer, who has the benefit of the new equipment in the shape of reduced charges, the burden of the loss by supersession of equipment \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 410]\n\u00a0\n otherwise in good condition; that it avoids the defect that is inherent in a system of setting aside reserves in advance of abandonment, namely, that while the life of a depreciable unit is difficult enough to estimate when physical decay alone is considered, it is practically impossible to forecast when we consider that obsolescence and inadequacy, which usually account for abandonments in a gas manufacturing plant, follow no rules as to time of their operation; that, finally, progress in service is promoted by giving a gas company an incentive to improvement of its machinery and its processes in the shape of increased profits. It must be admitted that if replacement of an old machine has not been sufficiently provided for by reserves in advance, a company will naturally defer installing a new machine, and so progress is halted. It is, furthermore, true that the application of the usual formula, fair return on fair present value of the plant in service, gives to the consumer all the advantages of economies in operating costs, which plainly is not entire justice. The city's counsel agrees (Argument, 451) that if obsolescence had occurred suddenly, with no opportunity to create reserves for replacement, the loss should be amortized after abandonment; but he denies that the facts here conform to the hypothesis. ...\n\n'Mr. E. C. Jones, chief gas engineer of plaintiff, and his son, Mr. Leon B. Jones, assistant gas engineer, on an application filed May 23, 1912, were on March 10, 1914, granted United States Letters Patent for an improved apparatus for manufacturing oil gas; and on October 19, 1915, on an application also filed May 23, 1912, were granted letters for the process. On November 30, 1915, they granted to plaintiff the exclusive right to use the process, and to make and use, but not to sell, the apparatus, together with future improvements in either process or apparatus made during the lives of the patents; the rights granted being transferable, but restricted as to place \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 411]\n\u00a0\n to a number of named counties in Northern and Central California. Despite the late date of the grant, plaintiff's beneficial right covered the period in suit, for the prior installation of generators embodying the Jones patents at the Metropolitan and the Potrero stations, with the patentees' consent, conferred an implied license to use them during their life in the San Francisco district; but this license was not exclusive. The contract underlying the grants ( Exhibit 61) recited that the company had permitted the patentees to use its plant and facilities for experimentation and commercial demonstration of their investions; had expended in alterations in its Metropolitan plant a sum exceeding $100,000, and also had expended in erecting two new gas generators at the Potrero station embodying the inventions a sum exceeding $215,000; that continued operation of all said new or altered apparatus under the patentees' direction had demonstrated the great utility and value of the inventions and that they could be utilized 'to the great pecuniary advantage' of the plaintiff company; that the company had allowed the patentees to exhibit the apparatus to many persons interested in gas manufacture in this country and Europe as a demonstration of the utility and value of their inventions, and that the patentees regarded the privilege of future such exhibitions as of great value to them. It was then agreed that for the grants first above referred to the company would pay the patentees the sum of $46,066.67, and would allow full opportunity for future exhibition of the generators, and so forth.\n\n'The question is at what figures these rights of the company shall be taken into the rating base. It seems to be agreed that the amount actually paid in 1915 is already represented in the amount hitherto added as additions and betterments.\n\n'The presentation of plaintiff's case in the form approved by its counsel does not primarily involve the giving \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 412]\n\u00a0\n of a value to these patent rights. Counsel in argument stated in substance that the evidence as to their value seemed to involve such enormous sums that he preferred the more conservative course of giving them consideration in his conception of the proper treatment of losses by obsolescence. It will be remembered that his argument was that no new invention would be installed by a man of business unless its savings were available to him to recoup losses of capital abandoned to make way for it; that the patent monopoly would enable him to compel a price adequate for his recoupment; and that in a proceeding like this it was equitable to divide the savings with the consumer and apply the company's share to reimbursement of the loss by abandonment, meanwhile rating the new property at value new. I have said that there was strength of reason in this plan, but that in involved a matter of administrative policy that was primarily for the state's regulatory body. I have not followed this plan for this reason and for the further reason that it appeared obsolescence could have been foreseen and provided for, and apparently had been provided for. This means that the question of value of the rights must be now considered.\n\n'The evidence is not very full on the part of plaintiff. And due perhaps to plaintiff's position as to obsolescence, there was little cross-examination by the city and no contrary evidence. With oil at 68 1\/2 cents a barrel to plaintiff during the years 1912-16, Mr. Bridges estimates the savings under the Jones process at 2 1\/2 cents a thousand feet of gas manufactured. (Exhibit 62.) In Table X of his supplemental argument, Mr. Bosley estimates the savings shown by the evidence at 2+ cents for the first two years and over 4 cents for the year 1915-16, or, in sum total, $103,530.39 for 1913-14, $132,419.45 for 1914-15, and $258,557.81 for 1915-16. A just criticism of these estimates is that they give no influence to the \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 413]\n\u00a0\n economies due to larger production. Mr. Britton, general manager of plaintiff, speaking of results attained in 1916-17, testifies that the new Jones generators effected a saving of two gallons of oil per thousand feet of gas and over one cent a thousand in labor costs of manufacture. (Tr. 2248 seq.) Projecting the savings over the 16 remaining years of the letters patent, he computes the aggregate savings at $7,630,300. (Tr. 2251.) Mr. Vincent computes the present worth on June 30, 1916, of these future savings at $4,203,300. ( Exhibit 67.) While apparently the estimates are made on conservative bases, it is, of course, true that forecasts like this are full of uncertainties; for example, oil may rise to a price prohibitive for gas consumption on the present scale, or other inentions or even substitutes for gas may diminish the value of the Jones patent.\n\n'There is no doubt that these patents are property, and of great value. It is also true, I think, that justice demands that the utility company should profit in some substantial proportion by the economies brought about by its ability in management or its improvements in methods of manufacture. There is no good reason why the consumers should get all the advantages that are the fruit of the genius of these inventors. If by the terms of their employment Mr. Jones and his son had been bound to assign their patents to plaintiff without further compensation, and had done so, the city could not justly claim that the company should have no part of the savings effected. The patents would have to be valued. But in view of the fact that the company and the patentees, dealing presumably at arms' length, have reached a figure of about $46,000 as the value of exclusive rights throughout Northern California, I am as much embarrassed as was plaintiff's counsel in concluding that in San Francisco alone the rights are to be valued for purposes of return at $ 4,000,000 or any substantial \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 414]\n\u00a0\n fraction of that sum. And how are we to compare in value the full rights obtained by express grant in 1915 and the restricted rights arising by implied license in the prior years? In view of the state of the evidence, it seems to me better to pass the whole matter for future consideration in connection with the rates of later years, when the state commission can pass on it with full evidence before it. On the record before me I do not see my way clear to add any figure to the rating base on account of these patent rights. ...\n\n'Objections Nos. 8, 9 and 10 have to do with the valuation of plaintiff's rights under the Jones patents. Plaintiff is incorrect in stating that the master failed to find the present value of the patent rights. These were allowed in capital value as stated (page 85) at $46,066.67, the amount paid the grantors in 1915. If the plaintiff had paid the inventors, say $500,000, or other considerable sum, for these patent rights, there is no reason to doubt that this figure would have been accepted as the valuation for purposes of return. It is not my view that a valuation must follow cost, although it is more apt to do so where the purchase was recently made. I have stated as fully as I could the reasons why I could not find the immensely greater figure which plaintiff claims. Briefly, the evidence was entirely too speculative. There is, after all, in such a policy no particular restriction to enterprise in denying to stockholders the fruits of valuable inventions, because the stockholders do not function in the direction of enterprise. The way to reward enterprise is to pay large sums to inventors, but that is not the question here. In a supplementary argument counsel asks me to apply here the rule which prevails in patent accountings, where, when damages cannot be ascertained by reference to an established royalty, the master is permitted to determine from all the evidence what would have been a reasonable royalty. The qualification to this rule is, however, that \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 415]\n\u00a0\n the master must have some evidence upon which his mind can work and rely, and that is to a large degree lacking here, save in so far as it is given by the amount of the purchase price. The objections named are accordingly overruled.'\n\n Obviously, under the theory accepted below, appellant worsened its situation for rate-making puroses when it reduced the cost of manufacturing gas. Introduction of successful patented inventions enabled the public authorities to lower the rate base and gather all the benefits. The operating plant, made capable of producing gas at smaller cost, was declared less valuable than before. The result indicates error somewhere, either in theory or application of principle.\n Obsolescence of one or more stations and perhaps other property theretofore of great value (possibly $800,000) followed installation of the patents, but the remaining plant plus the patents gave better results. As an operating unit the new combination had greater value than the old; but the court below disregarded the demonstrated worth of the element which wrought this thange.\n The obsolescence in question did not result from ordinary use and wear. Certainly it could not have been long anticipated-the patents were of recent conception; to provide for it out of previous revenues was not imperative, if possible. Former consumers were not beneficiaries; only subsequent ones could be advantaged.\n Our concern is with confiscation. Rate making is no function of the courts; their duty is to inquire concerning results and uphold the guaranties which inhibit the taking of private property for public use without just compensation under any guise. We may not, therefore, relegate appellant's claim for past services to the future consideration of the state commission, as the master suggests. After adopting the reduced costs of manufacture for estimating net returns, the court gave no proper \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 416]\n\u00a0\n valuation to the inventions which caused the reduction, and thereby permitted property to be taken without just compensation. The amount of money actually paid to the inventors was not the proper measure of worth. Experience had demonstrated a much higher one; and to obtain the benefit of their use appellant sacrificed much.\n Installation of the inventions necessitated new outlay of money and abandonment of property theretofore valuable-both were necessary in order that the cost of manufacture might be reduced. If appellant's permissible profits depend upon the lowered costs and it is denied adequate return upon property which made the reduction possible, or recompense for the obsolescence, successful efforts to improve the service will prove extremely disadvantageous to it.\n Whether, under the peculiar circumstances here presented, the rate base should be fixed by adding to the agreed inventory some fair valuation of the patent rights, or whether prompt recoupment should be allowed for the obsolescence caused by their introduction, or whether appellant should be saved from actual ultimate loss by some other feasible method, we will not undertake to determine upon the present record. To the end that the issues may be reconsidered in view of this opinion, the decree below is reversed and the cause remanded for such further proceedings as the circumstances require, including another reference to the master if deemed advisable.\n Reversed. \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 417]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting). These cases were tried together. Each challenges as confiscatory an ordinance of the city of San Francisco fixing, for a single year, the price to be charged for gas. The rule of Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 466\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 418, was applied. The evidence, in condensed form, comes before us in a record of 943 pages. The master's original and supplemental reports occupy 131 pages. The master and the court found the rates to be compensatory. Three errors are assigned by the company which relate to depreciation. The facts applicable to the several years differ in part; but the same questions are presented in each. It will tend to clarity to discuss these with reference to the facts of No. 34, which involves the rate for the year beginning July 1, 1913\n\n\n First. The depreciation charge allowed for that year, for the plant as a whole, was $348,853. The company does not complain that this allowance is too small, if treated as an allowance for merely physical observed depreciation. Its claim is that an improved process, which had been introduced at the San Francisco works in 1912, resulted in a saving, during the year 1913-14, of $103,530 in oil and labor; that in 1913 it had become certain that this process would later render obsolete certain parts of the plant (called stations) which were in use throughout that year; and that, for the purpose of meeting this expected loss in capital through later abandonment of stations, the savings effected by the new process should have been charged against the earnings, and credited to a special depreciation reserve. If, as suggested below, the company's contention is that only one-half of the savings should be credited to this special depreciation reserve, the action of the District Court on this ground is obviously free from objection. For, in fact, there was included in the year's depreciation charge, for obsolescence of these stations, $64,962, which is more than one-half of the year's savings. But its claim here is that the whole of the savings of the year 1913-14 should have been so applied; and that, therefore, the balance thereof, namely, $38,568, should \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 418]\n\u00a0\n also have been included in this special depreciation charge. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The sum ($348,853) allowed as the depreciation charge for the year 1913-14 was nearly 3 per cent. of the then reproduction cost new of the whole plant, other than land. The master and the court found, as facts, that none of the plant was abandoned during that year; that the change in the process of manufacture was not revolutionary; that in view of the history of the art, such change or improvements, and resulting obsolescence of parts of the plants, schould have been foreseen; that, in fact, there had been accumulated, during the four years preceding 1912, as a general reserve for depreciation, the sum of $2,116,433.95; that this reserve had been charged off by the company to surplus in November, 1911; and that, but for this fact, it would have been available to meet the loss of capital which occurred later through the abandonment of stations.\n This alleged error does not present any question of law. Whether more of the savings of the year 1913-14 due to the introduction of the new process should have been allowed as a special depreciation charge for the obsolescence then known to be accruing, is clearly a question of fact. There is much conflict in the theories on which \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 419]\n\u00a0\n depreciation should be figured. \n2\n There was doubt when the obsolescence would culminate and what would be its extent. There was conflict in the evidence as to the rate to be deemed a fair return. Whether a return of 7 per cent. is the proper test of a compensatory rate must, obviously, depend in part upon whether the return includes any of the risk of obsolescence. \n3\n I cannot say that the master and the court erred in their conclusion of fact that, all things considered, the depreciation charge allowed was adequate. The same is true of the depreciation charges allowed for the years 1914 and 1915.4 \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 420]\n\u00a0\n Second. As an alternative to allowing a larger depreciation charge out of the year's savings through the improved process and apparatus, the company urges that the rate base should have been increased, by adding thereto the value of the right to use the new process at the San Francisco works. \n5\n The court apparently adopted this view of the law. It ruled that the company was entitled to a return upon the then value (as part of the rate base) of the right to use the inventions. It differed from the company only in the estimate of the value. The company's experts declared that the value of this right might be ascertained by capitalizing the average annual savings expected to be effected thereby. So calculated, the value is $4,203,300. The court found specifically that it could not accept estimated savings as a measure of value; among other reasons, because the amount of savings was dependent in large measure upon the price of crude oil, and that this price fluctuates largely from time to time. It included in the rate base for 1913-14 the value of the gas generators (at the Metropolitan plant) which had been reconstructed so as to embody the inventions, and found that there was in \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 421]\n\u00a0\n the record no evidence on which it could give to the right to use the inventions a greater value than was allowed. So far as concerns the year 1913-14, the question is, merely, whether on the evidence in the record the value of the reconstructed generators (including, of course, the right to use them) was too small. \n6\n It appeared that for the right to use the inventions nothing was paid either during the year 1913-14 or during the year 1914-15; and that for the exclusive right to use them both in San Francisco and throughout a number of counties in Northern California, the company paid to the inventors, in November, 1915, $46,066.68. I cannot say that the master and the District Court erred in the finding of fact by which they valued this item for that year, or in the value assigned to the right in fixing the rate base for either of the two following years. \n7\n This alternative contention of the company presents, obviously, no question of law.\n Third. The reproduction cost new of the manufacturing and distributing plant, other than land, was found to be $12,794,008; the accrued depreciation, $1,518,390 \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 422]\n\u00a0\n (as of June 30, 1914). Thus, the property was found to be worth 88.1 per cent. of its then reproduction cost. The company contends that the accrued depreciation should have been set at $828,916.41; so that the plant was worth 93.7 per cent. of its then reproduction cost. The master employed the 'compound interest' or 'modified sinking fund' method of estimating accrued depreciation. The plant is in part very old. The depreciation found is but a small percentage of the reproduction cost. The evidence bearing upon the amount to be deducted for accrued depreciation occupies 232 pages of the record. The discussion thereof in the master's report occupies 39 pages. There was a conflict of evidence.\n No question of law is presented by this assignment of error. \n8\n The company's objection is not to the particular method selected, but that, in applying it, the master included as depreciation what is called theoretical inadequacy and obsolescence. Whether he did is a question of fact. The city denies that the reduction in value made by the master on account of accrued depreciation includes any sum representing expected loss through future abandonment of the stations. It is clear that, if any deduction was made on account of the probable abandonment of the stations, the obsolescence thus provided for was not theoretical. The new process had been introduced 2 years before the date as of which the valuation was made. On the facts then known, it was expected that the stations would have to be abandoned in the \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 423]\n\u00a0\n near future. Because it was to be expected (and was not theoretical) the company contended that to offset it more of the year's savings should have been charged against the income of that year. I cannot say that the master and the court erred in their findings of fact as to the amount of accrued depreciation.\n This litigation has already extended over 11 years. The record discloses that the cases were presented below by competent counsel with the aid of competent experts, and that they received careful consideration by an able master and an able trial judge. Counsel, master, and court have throughout endeavored to apply the rule of Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 466\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 418. It was not shown that the rule has, in any respect, been departed from. This court harbors a doubt whether, in applying it, some injustice may not have been done to the company. Is it probable that a nearer approach to justice, as between the parties, will be attained by a continuation of the effort to apply the same rule? To me it seems that the doubt is inherent in the rule itself. It can be overcome only by substituting some other rule for that found to be unworkable. Such other lies near at hand, and it is consistent with the Constitution.\n It was settled by Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 U.S. 1\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 148, that every public utility must, at its peril, provide an adequate amount to cover depreciation. A depreciation charge resembles a life insurance premium. The depreciation reserve, to which it is credited, supplies insurance for the plant against its inevitable decadence, as the life insurance reserve supplies the fund to meet the agreed value of the lost human life. To determine what the amount of the annual life insurance premium should be is a much simpler task than to determine the proper depreciation charge. For life insurance is a co- operative undertaking. The premium to be fixed is not that required by the probable duration of the life of a \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 424]\n\u00a0\n single insured individual, but that required by the average expectancy of life of men or women of the given age. Moreover, for human lives, mortality tables have been constructed which embody the results of large experience and long study. By their use the required premium may be fixed with an approximation to accuracy. But, despite the relative simplicity of the problem, it was found that the variables leave so wide a margin for error that premiums fixed in accordance with mortality tables work serious injustice either to the insurer or to the insured. Although the purpose was to charge only the appropriate premium, the transaction resulted sometimes in bankruptcy of the insurer; sometimes in his securing profits which seemed extortionate; and, rarely, in his receiving only the intended fair compensation for the service rendered. Because every attempt to approximate more nearly the amount of required premium proved futile, justice was sought by another route. Ultimately, strictly mutual insurance was adopted. Under it, the premium charged is made clearly ample, and the part thereof which proves not to have been needed inures in some form to the benefit of him who paid it. Compare Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Lederer, \n252 \nU.S. 523, 524\n, 525 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 397.\n Legal science can solve the problem of the just depreciation charge for public utilities in a similar manner. Under the rule which fixes the rate base at the amount prudently invested, the inevitable errors incident to fixing the year's depreciation charge do not result in injustice either to the utility or to the community. If, when plant must be replaced, the amount set aside for depreciation proves to have been inadequate, and investment of new capital is required, the utility is permitted to earn the annual cost of the new capital. If, on the other hand, the amount set aside for depreciation proves to have been excessive, the income from the surplus reserve \n\n[265 U.S. 403, 425]\n\u00a0\n operates as a credit to reduce the current capital charge which the rates must earn. If a new device is adopted which involves additional investment ( to buy a new plant or a patent right) the company's investment, on which the return must be paid, is increased by that amount. If the new device does not involve new investment, but the innovation involves increased current payments (like royalties for use of a process) the additional disbursement is borne by the community as an operating expense. The cost of a scrapped plant is carried as part of the investment on which a return must be paid unless and until it has been retired, that is fully paid for, out of the depreciation reserve. Thus justice both to the owners of the utility and to the public is assured.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES. I am of opinion that the decree should be affirmed on the main point for reasons that will be stated by my Brother BRANDEIS. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In this connection, the confiscatory character of the rate rests, according to the test applied, upon the allowance or disallowance of a much smaller sum. For master and court have found that the earnings of the year 1913-14 exceeded 7 per cent. upon the rate base by more than $21,000. An additional allowance for depreciation of $17,000 would, therefore (even on the theory contended for by the company), have rendered the rate compensatory on a 7 per cent. basis. Moreover, a 6 per cent. rate was sustained in Stanislaus County v. San Joaquin & Kings River Canal & Irrigation Co., \n192 U.S. 201\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 241 (1904), Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 U.S. 1\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 148 (1909), and Cedar Rapids Gaslight Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 \nU.S. 655, 670\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 389 (1912). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The wide differences between engineers as to the proper method to be pursued is well known. See Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 294\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 544. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Gerard C. Henderson, Railway Valuation and the Courts, 33 Harv. L. Rev. 902, 916, 922, 923; John Bauer, Valuation of Public Utility Properties, 30 Pol. Sci. Q. 254, 275; R. S. Hale, Physical Valuation of Public Utilities, 45 Engineering Mag. 161, 163. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Appellant contends here that, due to the new method of manufacture, property of which the reproduction cost was $844,355.74, would become obsolete, that the total depreciation allowance covering this property for the three years was only $275,096, and that the difference-called net loss to the appellant-should be amortized by applying the savings to be effected by the new method of manufacture. But the first abandonment of stations occurred at the end of June, 1915. The estimated loss on the Martin station, then abandoned, was $237,651. No further supersession occurred during the period of litigation. There was merely the prediction made at the trial by the company's experts, that the Independent station would be abandoned in December, 1918, and the Potrero plant in December, 1920. Moreover, for the year 1914-15, the depreciation charge allowed was $ 372,680. Included in this amount is $68,198, directly attributable to loss caused by abandonments. The alleged savings from the new process for that period was $132,419. Thus, the amount allowed exceeded the one-half of the year's saving, which was suggested below as the proper measure of the appropriate charge. The increase in depreciation charge contended for here is $64,221. But the earnings for this year exceeded 7 per cent. on the rate base by more than $89,000, leaving a difference more than sufficient to cover this claim. The year 1915-16 can be similarly disposed of. The depreciation charge allowed was $380,519. The alleged savings from the new process for that year was estimated at $258,557. The increase in depreciation charge contended for here is $208,319. But one-half of the year's savings is $129,279; and the earnings for the year exceeded 7 per cent. on the rate base by $171,464. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The process and apparatus had been invented by the company's salaried engineers early in 1912. The cost of experiments were defrayed by it. The utility of the invention was proved in that year, at its expense, by reconstructing, during that year, two of its gas generators and making other changes in plant. In this way the company acquired an implied license to use the inventions. Wade v. Metcalf, \n129 U.S. 202\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 271; Dable Grain Shovel Co. v. Flint, \n137 U.S. 41\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 8. It did not acquire an express license until November 30, 1915; that is, shortly after the patent for the apparatus was granted. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The question is not one of continuing importance to the parties. Its correctness depends upon the state of the particular record. Any defect in this record can be avoided in proceedings concerning the rates for any year after June 30, 1916; and since October 29, 1917, the gas rates for San Francisco are fixed, not by city officials, but by the state railroad commission. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] The year 1914-15 presents no change in the situation from the preceding year. For 1915-16 the value of the two new Jones oil gas generators installed in the Potrero plant at a cost of $241,812.59 is included in the rate base, and as the value of the right to use the inventions the $46,066.68 paid. For this period, therefore, the question is merely whether on the evidence in the record the patents should have been valued at a sum in excess of $46,066.68. But for both years only a large undervaluation would affect the result, as the master and the court found that during the year 1914-15 the prescribed rate would yield $89,446 in excess of a seven per cent. return on the rate base, and for 1915-16, an excess of $171,464. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] We have no occasion to undertake a legal delimitation of the function of a depreciation charge, or to define its legal relations to the depreciation reserves, or to determine whether the loss through the abandonment of a station in 1915 and that expected to result from later abandonments might be set off against the depreciation reserve accumulated shortly before the invention of the new process. \n\n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPACIFIC TEL. & TEL. CO. v. KUYKENDALL(1924)\nNo. 540\nArgued: April 17, 1924Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 196, 197]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Otto B. Rupp and W. V. Tanner, both of Seattle, Wash., Frank T. Post, of Spokane, Wash., and H. D. Pillsbury, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\n Messrs. John H. Dunbar, of Olympia, Wash., T. J. L. Kennedy, of Seattle, Wash., Alexander M. Winston, of Spokane, Wash., and Raymond W. Clifford, of Olympia, Wash., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are two appeals from the District Court in the same case involving the question of the confiscatory character \n\n[265 U.S. 196, 198]\n\u00a0\n of rates for telephone service within the state of Washington and in the cities of Seattle and Tacoma, to which rates the appellant company is limited by a refusal of the Department of Public Works to permit an increase thereof. The Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company is a corporation of California authorized to do business in Washington and owning a plant covering the state. It owns all the stock of the Home Telephone Company, which owns and operates the Spokane Exchange. A similar question as to confiscatory rates has arisen in respect to that company and that exchange, but a separate bill was filed by that company and is considered on appeal in a case reported next after this.\n This bill by the Pacific Company seeks an injunction against the Department of Public Works of the state to prevent it from interfering with the maintenance and collection of the increased rates the company proposes in all parts of Washington except Spokane. A court of three judges was organized to hear the application for a temporary order. The suit depended for jurisdiction both on the diverse citizenship of the parties and upon the averment that the order of the Department of Public Works if enforced would deprive the company of its property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court set aside the temporary restraining order issued by the District Judge on the filing of the bill and denied the application for temporary injunction. Appeal was taken direct to this court under Judicial Code,  266, as amended by Act March 4, 1913 (37 Stat. 1013 [Comp. St.  1243]). After the denial of the temporary injunction, the District Judge heard the case on a motion to dismiss the bill, and granted the motion, and from this final decree a second appeal was taken.\n The bill of complaint shows that on August 8, 1919, the Public Service Commission of the state, the predecessor of the Department of Public Works, made an order \n\n[265 U.S. 196, 199]\n\u00a0\n prescribing maximum rates and charges to be charged by the Pacific Company on and after that date within the state of Washington which are made an exhibit to the bill; that on September 20, 1922, the company filed a schedule of rates with the Department of Public Works increasing rates to be charged for exchange telephone service in all the exchanges owned by the company in Washington; that the department on September 24, 1922, suspended the rates for 30 days; and that after numerous hearings as to their reasonableness, the department by a majority of two members on March 31, 1923, denied the increase. The bill further averred that the fair and reasonable value of the property of the company in Washington, not including the Spokane plant, was $35,616,896, which includes $20,852,607 for the Seattle plant, and $3,457,290, for that of Tacoma, and that this estimate includes nothing for franchises and nothing for going concern; that the fair annual return which the company was entitled to earn was 8 per cent. on this value, whereas the actual return was as follows:\n Fair Cost. Value. Year 1919, state of Washington 4.97% 3.67% Year 1919, city of Seattle 3.97% 2.66% Year 1919, city of Tacoma .98% .81% Year 1920, state of Washington 4.42% 3.33% Year 1920, city of Seattle 1.85% 1.29% Year 1920, city of Tacoma .89% .74% Year 1921, state of Washington 3.30% 2.58% Year 1921, city of Seattle .69% .52% Year 1921, city of Tacoma .58% .48% Year 1922, state of Washington 3.17% 2.58% Year 1922, city of Seattle .19% .15% Year 1922, city of Tacoma .89% .75%\n that such returns were confiscatory and a violation of the rights of the company under the Fourteenth Amendment; that therefore the order of March 31, 1923, was void; that the company had no adequate remedy at law; that if an attempt were made to enforce the rates it proposed to \n\n[265 U.S. 196, 200]\n\u00a0\n make the Department of Public Works and others in state authority, defendants, would, unless restrained by the court, institute proceedings to compel compliance with the confiscatory schedule, and that the company and its officers and employees would be subjected to a multiplicity of suits, and incur criminal penalties prescribed by the laws of the state.\n By the statutes of Washington (section 10428, Remington's Comp. St. 1922), any complainant affected by any order of the commission (now the department) may within 30 days apply to the superior court of the proper county for a writ of review 'for the purpose of having its reasonablenes and lawfulness inquired into and determined.' The commission certifies the record, upon which the court is to enter judgment affirming or setting aside the commission's order. If reversed for failing to receive proper evidence offered, the case is to be referred back to the commission to receive the evidence and enter a new order. The court may remand any case reversed by it to the commission for further action. It is clear that the function to be performed by the superior court under this section is judicial. It does not fix rates or enter a new order as to them. It does not pass on the sufficiency or weight of evidence. It only looks into the reasonableness and lawfulness of the order of the commission, and is to determine whether evidence which should have been received was rejected, and in that case is to send the case back to the commission for a new order. The court does not act legislatively.\n Instead of applying to the superior court of the state, therefore, application was made by the bill herein to the federal District Court within the 30 days to restrain the order of the department as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n By section 10424, Rem. Comp. Stat. 1922, relating to the filing of tariffs increasing rates and providing for a \n\n[265 U.S. 196, 201]\n\u00a0\n hearing on such proposed increase and the suspension of the schedule pending the hearing, it is declared that:\n'If the commission shall at the conclusion of the hearing refuse to permit such increase, either in whole or in part, no supersedeas shall be granted in any action or proceeding brought to review the order of the commission pending the final determination of such action by the superior court, or, if appealed to the Supreme Court, by such Supreme Court.'\n\n It is apparent from these provisions that after the commission finally denied the increase of rates applied for, the company had exhausted its administrative remedy to avoid the alleged confiscatory rates under which it was compelled to render the service. It had, therefore, no recourse but to a court. Both by reason of diverse citizenship and because of the federal constitutional question the federal court of equity was available to it. The state statute forbidding a stay of proceedings until a final judicial decree was rendered, of course, could not prevent a federal court of equity from affording such temporary relief by injunction as the principles of equity procedure required. The conditions set out in the bill, therefore, seem to have made a case ripe for federal relief. Bacon v. Rutland, R. R. Co., \n232 U.S. 134\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 283; Prendergast v. N. Y. Tel. Co., \n262 \nU.S. 43, 48\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 466.\n But it is urged that such relief is premature because the rates, increase of which was refused, were reasonable, and afforded an adequate return on the value of the property of the company used in the public service as fixed by the commission in accord with the statutory procedure for that purpose, and that the company still has a right to appeal from the valuation of the commission to the superior and Supreme Courts on the legislative question of that valuation.\n Section 10441 of the state of Washington (Remington, Comp. St. 1922) has elaborate provisions for the fixing \n\n[265 U.S. 196, 202]\n\u00a0\n of the value of the property and equipment of a public service company. The company is given 30 days' notice of a hearing and is entitled to adduce evidence and to have it transcribed and certified. The commission is to render findings of fact in writing concerning all matters concerning which evidence may be introduced tending to show the value of the company's property used for the public convenience. The company believing the findings to be unfair, unwarranted, or unjust, may go into the superior court and have a writ of review of such findings and their correctness, reasonableness and lawfulness inquired into and determined, and if the court finds them to be 'unjust, incorrect, unreasonable, unlawful or not supported by the evidence,' it shall make 'new and correct findings,' unless it sets them aside for refusing to receive proper evidence, and returns them for new findings thereon. The company is given the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the state which is given the same power as the superior court as to findings of the commission. The findings of the commission as corrected by the courts are made admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding except in matters of taxation, and are to be conclusive evidence of the facts found under conditions then existing and can only be controverted by showing a subsequent change of conditions. Provision is made for further hearings to ascertain betterments, improvements, extensions, and additions, and the values of the property used by the company for interstate and for intrastate business.\n It is clear that the function of the courts in fixing the valuation of the property of the public utility is not confined to a judicial review of the work of the commission. The courts are made part of the valuation tribunal, pass on the weight of the evidence, and can set aside a valuation and make a new one. Keller v. Potomac Co., \n261 U.S. 428\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 445. \n\n[265 U.S. 196, 203]\n\u00a0\n It is thus apparent that the contention of the department and the state authorities that the company has not exhausted its remedy to secure a change in the valuation of the property by the superior and Supreme Courts of the state is correct, and that resort to them to change the valuation would be no bar to a resort to a federal court of equity to enjoin the enforcement of rates based upon such valuation after it had been approved by the state courts. It was on this ground that the District Court held, both on the application for a temporary injunction before the three judges and upon the final dismissal, that the bill was premature, and could not be brought until after the final confirmation of the valuation by the state Supreme Court.\n The District Court relied on the case of Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 U.S. 210\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 67. In that case, the tribunal which fixed railroad rates that were the subject of controversy consisted not only of a commission, but of the Supreme Court of the state on appeal, and the court in reaching its conclusion acted legislatively, as the commission did. It was held that, as the complaining company had not exhausted its legislative remedy by appeal to the Supreme Court of the state, for its final action in the fixing of rates, comity, in absence of a controlling right to the contrary, required that the federal court delay remedy by injunction against the rates fixed until the company had invoked the conclusion of the state Supreme Court in respect to them. So here it is contended that, until the superior and Supreme Courts shall have finally considered the correctness of the valuation upon which the adequacy of the rates depends, comity requires that the federal court shall stay its hand.\n It is first objected to this view that the Constitution of the state of Washington does not authorize its Legislature to vest its courts with the legislative power to fix rates, and therefore that, after the commission had fixed the \n\n[265 U.S. 196, 204]\n\u00a0\n valuation, further procedure in fixing valuation was void, and there was no reason either of comity or right which should delay the remedy by a bill in a federal court. Territory ex rel. Kelly v. Stewart, 1 Wash. 98, 110, 23 Pac. 405, 8 L. R. A. 106; State ex rel. Seattle v. Public Service Commission, 76 Wash. 492, 500, 136 Pac. 850. It is our duty to avoid expressing an opinion on such an issue under the Constitution of Washington in the absence of a clear decision by its highest court, if we can do so, and we think we can.\n In the case before us, the company is shown by the averments of its bill to be suffering daily from confiscation under the rates to which it is now limited. It has done all it could to get relief and cannot get it. The rates here in question were in force for more than a year, the company advanced them, the old rates were reinstated by the Department of Public Works. In such a case then there was no chance for a stay. By section 10429, Remington's Comp. St. 1922, the pendency of any writ of review does not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the commission, but the superior court may suspend the order, but no order suspending an order of the commission relating to rates, etc., can be made unless the court finds that great or irreparable damage would be done to the petitioner, and the section contains the following proviso:\n'Provided, however, that when any rate has been in force for any length of time exceeding one year, and such rate is advanced by the public service company, and the order of the commission reinstates such prior rate, in whole or in part, no supersedeas shall be allowed in any case from such order pending the final determination of the cause in the superior court, or if appealed to the Supreme Court by such Supreme Court.'\n\n Under such circumstances comity yields to constitutional right, and the fact that the procedure on appeal in the legislative fixing of rates has not been concluded \n\n[265 U.S. 196, 205]\n\u00a0\n will not prevent a federal court of equity from suspending the daily confiscation, if it finds the case to justify it. Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 293\n, 43 S. Sup Ct. 353. In such a case the Prentis Case has no application. Love v. Atchison Railway Co., 185 Fed. 321, 324, 325, 107 C. C. A. 403.\n But it is argued that the courts of Washington have inherent power to grant a supersedeas in such a case, and that sections 10429 and 10424, supra, are invalid. As we have declined to look into the validity of the legislative functions with which the Washington state courts are vested in the valuation sections, so we decline to examine the validity of these restraints upon those courts to grant stays in cases of rates. A litigant whose constitutional rights are being invaded, and to whom a statute denies a supersedeas in the state tribunals, may properly base his application for equitable relief on the effect of the statute and the presumption of its validity and is not required to establish that the state statute is not invalid under the state Constitution. Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n255 \nU.S. 288, 296\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 272, presents an analogous case.\n Nor does the provision of section 266 of the Judicial Code (37 Stat. 1013, c. 160), that a suit in a state court to enforce the rate complained of, accompanied by a stay, shall suspend the proceedings in the federal court, prevent the filing and prosecution of this bill, first because no such suit seems to have been brought, and, even if it had been, there certainly has been no stay of proceedings in the state court as provided in that section. Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., supra.\n We think, therefore, that the District Court erred in denying a temporary injunction under section 266 on the ground that the bill was premature.\n But it is said that the appeal from the interlocutory decree in No. 540 was merged in the appeal from the final decree in No. 739, and therefore should be dismissed. A motion was made for this purpose. We think that under \n\n[265 U.S. 196, 206]\n\u00a0\n Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 44\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 221, this motion should be granted; but it does not change the ultimate result, because the final decree of the District Court dismissing the bill really turned on the same erroneous ruling of its prematurity as that upon which the temporary injunction was denied, and must be reversed for the same reason.\n After the case was reached in this court, somewhat extended argument was made in the later appeal to show that the bill was defective in stating a case for equitable relief, even if it was not premature. The argument is based on objections which seem to us to be rather makeweights or afterthoughts, and are so unsubstantial that we do not discuss them. The merits of the issue between the parties can be developed after the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.\n Decree reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPANAMA R. CO. v. JOHNSON(1924)\nNo. 369\nArgued: December 7, 1923Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 375, 376]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Richard Reid Rogers, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 375, 382]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wade H. Ellis, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action by a seaman against his employer, the owner of the ship on which he was serving, to recover damages for personal injuries suffered at sea while he was ascending a ladder from the deck to the bridge in the course of his employment-the complaint charging that the injuries resulted from negligence of the employer in providing an inadequate ladder and negligence of the ship's officers in permitting a canvas dodger to be stretched and insecurely fastened across the top of the ladder and in ordering the seaman to go up the ladder. The employer was a New York corporation. The ship was a domestic merchant vessel which at the time of the injuries was returning from an Ecuadorian port. The action was brought on the common-law side of a District Court of the United States, and the right of recovery was based expressly on section 20 of the Act of March 4, 1915, c. 153, 38 Stat. 1185, as amended by section 33 of the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250, 41 Stat. 1007 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8337a), which reads as follows \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 383]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 20. That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable. Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.'\n The defendant unsuccessfully demurred to the complaint and then answered. The issues were tried to the court and a jury; a verdict for the plaintiff was returned, and a judgment was entered thereon, which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 289 Fed. 964. The defendant prosecutes this writ of error.\n\n 1. \nApparently the action was not brought in the district of the defendant's residence or principal office as provided in the act, and on this ground the defendant objected that the District Court could not entertain it. The objection was not made at the outset on a special appearance, but after the defendant had appeared generally and demurred to the complaint. The court thought the objection went to the venue only and was waived by the general appearance; so the objection was overruled. 277 Fed. 859. Error is assigned on the ruling; but we think it was right.\n The case arose under a law of the United States and involved the requisite amount, if any was requisite;1 so \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 384]\n\u00a0\n there can be no doubt that the case was within the general jurisdiction conferred on the District Courts by section 24 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991), unless, as the defendant contends, it was excluded by the concluding provision of the act, which says:\n'Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.'\n\n Although not happily worded, the provision, taken alone, gives color to the contention. But as a general rule, where existing legislation on a particular subject has been systematically revised and restated in a comprehensive general statute, such as the Judicial Code, subsequent enactments touching that subject are to be construed and applied in harmony with the general statute, save as they clearly manifest a different purpose. An intention to depart from a course or policy thus deliberately settled is not lightly to be assumed. See United States v. Barnes, \n222 \nU.S. 513, 520\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 117; United States v. Sweet, \n245 \nU.S. 563, 572\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 193. The rule is specially pertinent here. Beginning with Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 73 ), Congress has pursued the policy of investing the federal courts-at first the Circuit Courts, and later the District Courts-with a general jurisdiction expressed in terms applicable alike to all of them and of regulating the venue by separate provisions designating the particular district in which a defendant shall be sued, such as the district of which he is an inhabitant or in which he has a place of business-the purpose of the venue provisions being to prevent defendants from being compelled to answer and defend in remote districts against their will. This policy was carried into the Judicial Code, and is shown in sections 24 and 51 (Comp. St.  991, 1033); one embodying general jurisdictional provisions applicable to rights under subsequent laws as well as laws then existing, and the other containing particular venue provisions. A reading of the provision now before us with those sections, and in the light of the policy carried into \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 385]\n\u00a0\n them, makes it reasonably certain that the provision is not intended to affect the general jurisdiction of the District Courts as defined in section 24, but only to prescribe the venue for actions brought under the new act of which it is a part. No reason why it should have a different purpose has been suggested, nor do we perceive any. Its use of the owrd 'jurisdiction' seems inapt, and therefore not of special significance. The words 'shall be' are stressed by the defendant, but as they are found also in the earlier provisions, which uniformly have been held to relate to venue only, they afford no ground for a distinction.\n By a long line of decisions, recently reaffirmed, it is settled that such a provision merely confers on the defendant a personal privilege, which he may assert, or may waive, at his election, and does waive if, when sued in some other district, he enters a general appearance before or without claiming his privilege. Interior Construction & Improvement Co. v. Gibney, \n160 U.S. 217\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 272; United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 459, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 286; General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 261, 272\n, 275 S., 43 Sup. Ct. 106; Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 653, 655\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 230.\n\n 2. \nThe defendant objects that the statute whereon the plaintiff based his right of action is in conflict with section 2 of article 3 of the Constitution, which extends the judicial power of the United States to 'all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.' Before coming to the particular grounds of the objection, it will be helpful to refer briefly to the purpose and scope of the constitutional provision as reflected in prior decisions.\n As there could be no cases of 'admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,' in the absence of some maritime law under which they could arise, the provision presupposes the existence in the United States of a law of that character. Such a law or system of law existed in colonial times and \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 386]\n\u00a0\n during the Confederation, and commonly was applied in the adjudication of admiralty and maritime cases. It embodied the principles of the general maritime law, sometimes called the law of the sea, with modifications and supplements adjusting it to conditions and needs on this side of the Atlantic. The framers of the Constitution were familiar with that system and proceeded with it in mind. Their purpose was not to strike down or abrogate the system, but to place the entire subject-its substantive as well as its procedural features-under national control, because of its intimate relation to navigation and to interstate and foreign commerce. In pursuance of that purpose the constitutional provision was framed and adopted. Although containing no express grant of legislative power over the substantive law, the provision was regarded from the beginning as implicitly investing such power in the United States. Commentators took that view. Congress acted on it, and the courts, including this court, gave effect to it. Practically therefore the situation is as if that view were written into the provision. After the Constitution went into effect, the substantive law theretofore in force was not regarded as superseded or as being only the law of the several states, but as having become the law of the United States-subject to power in Congress to alter qualify or supplement it as experience or changing conditions might require. When all is considered, therefore, there is no room to doubt that the power of Congress extends to the entire subject and permits of the exercise of a wide discretion.\n But there are limitations which have come to be well recognized. One is that there are boundaries to the maritime law and admiralty jurisdiction which inhere in those subjects and cannot be altered by legislation, as by excluding a thing falling clearly within them or including a thing falling clearly without. Another is that the spirit and purpose of the constitutional provision require that \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 387]\n\u00a0\n the enactments-when not relating to matters whose existence or influence is confined to a more restricted field, as in Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 319-shall be coextensive with and operate uniformly in the whole of the United States. Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 457; The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 574, 577; Butler v. Boston & Savannah Steamship Co., \n130 \nU.S. 527, 556\n, 557 S., 9 Sup. Ct. 612; In re Garnett, \n141 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 11 S.

(5th Ed.)  1663, 1664, 1672\n\n\n In this connection it is well to recall that the Constitution, by section 1 of article 3, declares that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court 'and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,' and, by section 8 of article 1, empowers the Congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the several powers vested in the government of the United States. Mention should also be made of the enactment by the first Congress, now embodied in sections 24 and 256 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991, 1233), whereby the District Courts are given exclusive original jurisdiction 'of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.'\n The particular grounds on which a conflict with section 2 of article 3 is asserted are that the statute enables a seaman asserting a cause of action essentially maritime to withdraw it from the reach of the maritime law and the admiralty jurisdiction, and to have it determined according to the principles of a different system applicable to a distinct and irrelevant field, and also disregards the restriction in respect of uniformity. For reasons which will be stated we think neither ground can be sustained.\n The statute is concerned with the relative rights and obligations of seamen and their employers arising out of \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 388]\n\u00a0\n personal injuries sustained by the former in the course of their employment. Without question this is a matter which falls within the recognized sphere of the maritime law, and in respect of which the maritime rules have differed materially from those of the common law applicable to injuries sustained by employees in nonmaritime service. But, as Congress is empowered by the constitutional provision to alter, qualify or supplement the maritime rules, there is no reason why it may not bring them into relative conformity to the common-law rules or some modification of the latter, if the change be country-wide and uniform in operation. Not only so, but the constitutional provision interposes no obstacle to permitting rights founded on the maritime law or an admissible modification of it to be enforced as such through appropriate actions on the common-law side of the courts-that is to say, through proceedings in personam according to the course of the common law.

This was permissible before the Constitution, and it is still permissible. Judicial Code,  24 and 256; Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 460; New Jersey Steam Navigation Co. v. Merchants' Bank, 6 How. 344, 390; Leon v. Galceran, 11 Wall. 185, 188, 191; Schoonmaker v. Gilmore, \n102 U.S. 118\n; Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey, \n177 \nU.S. 638, 646\n, 20 S. Sup.

Ed. --.\n Rightly understood, to statute neither withdraws injuries to seamen from the reach and operation of the maritime law, nor enables the seamen to do so. On the contrary, it brings into that law new rules drawn from another system and extends to injured seamen a right to invoke, at their election, either the relief accorded by the old rules or that provided by the new rules. The election is between alternatives accorded by the maritime law as \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 389]\n\u00a0\n modified, and not between that law and some nonmaritime system.\n The source from which the new rules are drawn contributes nothing to their force in the field to which they are translated. In that field their strength and operation come altogether from their inclusion in the maritime law. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n237 \nU.S. 300, 303\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 598. True, they are not in so many words made part of that law; but an express declaration is not essential to make them such. As originally enacted, section 20 was part of an act the declared purpose of which was 'to promote the welfare of American seamen.' It then provided that in suits to recover damages for personal injuries 'seamen having command shall not be held to be fellow- servants with those under their authority,' and in Chelentis v. Luckenbach Steamship Co., supra, page 384 (38 Sup. Ct. 501, 504), this court treated it as part of the maritime law, but held it did not disclose a purpose 'to impose on shipowners the same measure of liability for injuries suffered by the crew while at sea as the common law prescribes for employers in respect of their employees on shore.' After that decision the section was re-enacted in the amended form herein-before set forth as part of an act the expressed object of which was 'to provide for the promotion and maintenance of the American merchant marine.' In that form it makes applicable to personal injuries suffered by seamen in the course of their employment 'all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees.' Thus its origin, environment and subject-matter show that it is intended to, and does, bring the rules to which it refers into the maritime law.\n But it is insisted that, even if the statute brings those rules into that law, it is still invalid in that it restricts the enforcement of right founded on them to actions at law, \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 390]\n\u00a0\n and thereby encroaches on the admiralty jurisdiction intended by the Constitution. It must be conceded that the construction thus sought to be put on the statute finds support in some of its words, and also that if it be so construed a grave question will arise respecting its constitutional validity. But, as this court often has held, 'a statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score.' United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 658, 659 (60 L. Ed. 1061, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854); United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 407\n, 408 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 527; Baender v. Barnett, \n225 U.S. 224\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 271. The question arises, therefore, whether the statute is fairly open to such a construction. There may be room for diverging opinions about the answer, but we think the better view is that it should be in the affirmative.\n The course of legislation, as exemplified in section 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, sections 563 (par. 8) and 711 (par. 3) of the Revised Statutes, and sections 24 (para. 3) and 256 (par. 3) of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991 \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 3]\n\u00a0\n, 1233), always has been to recognize the admiralty jurisdiction as open to the adjudication of all maritime cases as a matter of course, and to permit a resort to common-law remedies through appropriate proceedings in personam as a matter of admissible grace. It therefore is reasonable to believe that, had Congress intended by this statute to withdraw rights of action founded on the new rules from the admiralty jurisdiction and to make them cognizable only on the common- law side of the courts, it would have expressed that intention in terms befitting such a pronounced departure-that is to say, in terms unmistakably manifesting a purpose to make the resort to common-law remedies compulsory, and not merely permissible. But this was not doen. On the contrary, the terms of the statute in this regard are not imperative but permissive. It says 'may maintain' an action at law 'with the right of trial by \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 391]\n\u00a0\n jury,' the import of which is that the injured seaman is permitted, but not required, to proceed on the common-law side of the court with a trial by jury as an incident. The words 'in such action' in the succeeding clause are all that are troublesome. But we do not regard them as meaning that the seaman may have the benefit of the new rules if he sues on the law side of the court, but not if he sues on the admiralty side. Such a distinction would be so unreasonable that we are unwilling to attribute to Congress a purpose to make it. A more reasonable view, consistent with the spirit and purpose of the statute as a whole, is that the words are used in the sense of 'an action to recover damages for such injuries,' the emphasis being on the object of the suit rather than the jurisdiction in which it is brought. So we think the reference is to all actions brought to recover compensatory damages under the new rules as distinguished from the allowances covered by the old rules, usually consisting of wages and the expense of maintenance and cure. See The Osceola, \n189 U.S. 158\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 483; The Iroquois, \n194 U.S. 240\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 640; Chelentis v. Luckenbach Steamship Co., \n247 U.S. 372\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 501. In this view the statute leaves the injured seaman free under the general law-sections 24 (par. 3) and 256 (par. 3) of the Judicial Code-to assert his right of action under the new rules on the admiralty side of the court. On that side the issues will be tried by the court, but if he sues on the common-law side there will be a right of trial by jury. So construed, the statute does not encroach on the admiralty jurisdiction intended by the Constitution, but permits that jurisdiction to be invoked and exercised as it has been from the beginning.\n Criticism is made of the statute because it does not set forth the new rules but merely adopts them by a generic reference. But the criticism is without merit. The reference, as is readily understood, is to the Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, and its \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 392]\n\u00a0\n amendments (Comp. St.  8657-8665). This is a recognized mode of incorporating one statute or system of statutes into another, and serves to bring into the latter all that is fairly covered by the reference. Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, 625; In re Heath, \n144 U.S. 92\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 615; Corry v. Baltimore, \n196 \nU.S. 466, 477\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 297; Interstate Ry. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n207 \nU.S. 79, 84\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 26, 12 Ann. Cas. 555.\n The asserted departure from the restriction respecting uniformity in operation is without any basis. The statute extends territorially as far as Congress can make it go, and there is nothing in it to cause its operation to be otherwise than uniform. The national legislation respecting injuries to railway employees engaged in interstate and foreign commerce which it adopts has a uniform operation, and neither is nor can be deflected therefrom by local statutes or local views of common-law rules. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 51\n, 55 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368, 378\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 914. Of course that legislation will have a like operation as part of this statute.\n A further objection urged against the statute is that it conflicts with the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment in that it permits injured seamen to elect between varying measures of redress and between different forms of action without according a corresponding right to their employers, and therefore is unreasonably discriminatory and purely arbitrary. The complaint is not directed against either measure of redress or either form of action but only against the right of election as given. Of course the objection must fail. There are many instances in the law where a person entitled to sue may choose between alternative measures of redress and modes of enforcement; and this has been true since before the Constitution. But it never has been held, nor thought so far as we are advised, that to permit such a choice between alternatives otherwise admissible is a violation \n\n[264 U.S. 375, 393]\n\u00a0\n of due process of law. In the nature of things, the right to choose cannot be accorded to both parties, and, if accorded to either, should rest with the one seeking redress rather than the one from whom redress is sought.\n At the trial the defendant requested a directed verdict in its favor on the ground that no actionable negligence was shown, but the request was denied. Although approved by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the ruling is complained of here. In view of the concurring action of the two courts, we deem it enough to say that the record discloses sufficient evidence of negligence to warrant its submission to the jury.\n The defendant also complains that two requests which it preferred on the subject of assumption of risk were denied. The requests were so framed that, considering the state of the evidence, they would not have conveyed a right understanding of the subject and might well have proved misleading. Their refusal was not error.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND did not hear the argument or participate in the decision. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See the first and third subdivisions of section 24 of the Judicial Code. \n\n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPANAMA R.

Upon the verdict of a jury, final judgment was rendered for plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 272 F. 649.

This court, also, after elaborate consideration, held that no such action could be maintained in the courts of the United States under the general maritime law. The Harrisburg, \n119 U.S. 199\n 7 S. Ct. 140. And the general rule of the Roman civil law seems to have been the same as that of the common law. Such was the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Louisiana in a case which was discussed with great fullness and learning at the bar and well considered by that court upon its original presentation and upon rehearing. Hubgh v. N. O. & C. R. Co., 6 La. Ann. 495, 509-511.\n But it is contended that the action is maintainable under article 2341 of the Civil Code of Panama, which became operative in the Canal Zone by executive order of May 9, 1904. That article reads:\n'He who shall have been guilty of an offense or fault, which has caused another damage, is obliged to repair it, without prejudice to the principal which the law imposes for the fault or offense committed.'\n\n The applicable passage of the Executive Order is:\n'The laws of the land, with which the inhabitants are familiar, and which were in force on February 26, 1904, will continue in force in the Canal Zone ... until altered or annulled by the said Commission . ... \n\n[266 U.S. 209, 212]\n\u00a0\n The Act of Congress of August 24, 1912, c. 390,  2, 37 Stat. 560, 561 (Comp. St.  10038),1 had the effect of confirming this article as valid and binding within the Canal Zone.\n\n The provision under consideration apparently was adopted from the Code of Chile by the several states of Colombia, the adoption by Panama being in 1860. The contention is that the provision in the Chilean Code, in substance, was taken from the Code Napoleon, and is to be found, also, in the Civil Code of Spain; that both the French and the Spanish courts had interpreted it as justifying an action such as we are here reviewing; and the familiar rule is invoked that a provision adopted by one country from the laws of another country is presumed to carry with it the meaning which it had acquired by the known and settled construction of the latter. Undoubtedly the decisions of the French courts were to the effect stated. La Bourgogne, \n210 \nU.S. 95, 138\n, 28 S. Ct. 664. It must be borne in mind, however, that the South American countries named were predominantly Spanish in race and language, and therefore it may scarcely by doubted that the statute was taken directly from the Spanish and not the French Code. It follows that the presumption that the French construction was adopted with the adoption of the statute cannot be indulged. Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Humble, \n181 \nU.S. 57, 65\n, 21 S. Ct. 526. Moreover, there is nothing in any of the circumstances called to our attention to support an inference that the statute was adopted with knowledge of the French construction. See Hunter v. Truckee Lodge, 14 Nev. 24, 38-40. The earliest decision of the Spanish courts of which we are informed was in 1894. Borrero v. Compania Anonyma de la Luz Elec trica, \n\n[266 U.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n 1 Porto Rico Fed. 144, 147, long after the adoption of the statute by either Chile, Colombia, or Panama. The presumption in respect of the adoption of the Spanish construction, therefore, has no foundation upon which to rest and must, likewise, be rejected. Stutsman County v. Wallace, \n142 \nU.S. 293, 312\n, 12 S. Ct. 227.2 We are not advised that the courts of Chile and construed the provision prior to its adoption by Panama; and it is asserted, and not denied, that prior to its adoption by the executive order and congressional act, there had been no decision on the question by either the courts of Colombia or Panama.\n It remains, then, only to inquire whether the asserted right of action exists in virtue of the language of the statute independently construed. Upon that question decisions of the various Spanish-speaking countries are of persuasive force only; and even that is overcome or greatly diminished when it is shown that the cognate statute in Porto Rico, and, for aught that appears to the contrary, in the other Spanish-speaking countries, is supported by procedural or other provisions lending aid to its construction as a death statute. In the Borrero Case (page 146) it is said:\n'Under the practice formerly existing in Porto Rico, in a proper case the law provided for, not only criminal proceedings, but for indemnification on account of the unlawful act to those entitled to it, all in the same proceeding; but those entitled to the civil indemnity could decline to proceed with the criminal action, and yet sue for civil liability. Article 16 of the Penal Code provided that one liable for a misdemeanor was also liable civilly. Both the penal and civil liability could be determined in the same proceeding; and article 123 provided: 'The action \n\n[266 U.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n to demand restitution, reparation, or indemnification is also transmitted to the heirs of the person injured.\"\n\n The Supreme Court of Louisiana in the Hubgh Case, supra, considering the similar provision in the Louisiana Code, held that it did not include a civil action for death. This conclusion was reached after submitting the language to the test of civil law as well as common law principles.\n The executive order continued in force in the Canal Zone the laws of the land 'with which the inhabitants are familiar,' and this, in effect, was ratified by the act of Congress of 1912. Immediately following, the native population disappeared and the inhabitants of the Canal Zone since, largely American, have been only employees of the Canal and of those doing business in the Zone, who it is to be presumed were familiar with the rule of the common law rather than the construction said to have been put upon the statute by the various Spanishspeaking countries. As early as 1910, the Supreme Court of the Canal Zone declared that the courts of the Zone were 'in duty bound to follow the rules of statutory construction of the courts of common law and ascertain by them the meaning and spirit of the codes.' Kung Ching Chong v. Wing Chong, 2 Canal Zone Supreme Court, 25, 30. In the later case of Fitzpatrick v. Panama Railroad Co., Id., 111, decided in 1913, the same court said (page 121):\n'... If there is doubt or uncertainty as to the construction and interpretation of the laws here existing prior to February 26, 1904, the courts of the Canal Zone should accept and adopt that construction which more clearly harmonizes with the recognized principles of jurisprudence prevailing in the United States.'\n\n Under all the circumstances, we conclude that the reach of the statute is to be determined by the application of commonlaw principles ( Panama R. Co. v. Bosse, \n249 \nU.S. 41, 45\n, 39 S. Ct. 211), and, applying these principles, it is clear that the general language of article 2341 does not include the \n\n[266 U.S. 209, 215]\n\u00a0\n right of action here asserted. It would not be difficult to find generalizations of the common law quite as comprehensive in terms as the provision now under review, as, for example, 'There is no wrong without a remedy.' \n3\n But nevertheless, under the principles of the common law, it has required specific statutes to fix civil liability for death by wrongful act; and it is this requirement, rather than the construction put upon the statute in civil law countries, that the inhabitants of the Canal Zone are presumed to be familiar with, and which affords the rule by which the meaning and scope of the statute in question are to be determined.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES (dissenting).\n There is no dispute that the language of the Civil Code of Panama,  2341, which has been quoted, is broad enough on its face to give an action for negligently causing the death of the plaintiff's wife. Taken literally it gives such an action in terms. The article of the Code Napoleon from which it is said to have been copied is construed by the French Courts in accord with its literal meaning. La Bourgogne, \n210 \nU.S. 95, 138\n, 139 S., 28 S. Ct. 664. It would seem natural and proper to accept the interpretation given to the article at its source, and by the more authoritative jurists who have had occasion to deal with it, irrespective of whether that local interpretation was before or after its adoption by Spanish States, so long as nothing seriously to the contrary is shown. The only thing that I know of to the contrary is the tradition of the later common law. The common law view of the responsibility of a master for his servant was allowed to help in the interpretation of an ambiguous statute in \n\n[266 U.S. 209, 216]\n\u00a0\n Panama R. Co. v. Bosse, \n249 \nU.S. 41, 45\n, 39 S. Ct. 211, for reasons there stated. But those reasons have far less application here, even if we refer to the common law apart from statute, and in any case are not enough to override the plain meaning of statutory words.\n The common law as to master and servant, whatever may be thought of it, embodied a policy that has not disappeared from life But it seems to me that courts in dealing with statutes sometimes have been too slow to recognize that statutes even when in terms covering only particular cases may imply a policy different from that of the common law, and therefore may exclude a reference to the common law for the purpose of limiting their scope. Johnson v. United States, 163 F. 30, 32, 89 C. C. A. 508, 18 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1194. Without going into the reasons for the notion that an action (other than an appeal) does not lie for causing the death of a human being, it is enough to say that they have disappeared. The policy that forbade such an action, if it was more profound than the absence of a remedy when a man's body was hanged and his goods confiscated for the felony, has been shown not to be the policy of present law by statutes of the United States and of most if not all of the states. In such circumstances it seems to me that we should not be astute to deprive the words of the Panama Code of their natural effect.\n The decision in the Hubgh Case, 6 La. Ann. 495, stands on nothing better than the classic tradition that the life of a free human being, (it was otherwise with regard to slaves,) did not admit of valuation, which no longer is true sentimentally, as is shown by the statutes, and which economically is false.\n I think that the judgment should be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McKENNA, and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'That all laws, orders, regulations, and ordinances adopted and promulgated in the Canal Zone by order of the President for the government and sanitation of the Canal Zone and the construction of the Panama Canal are hereby ratified and confirmed as valid and binding until Congress shall otherwise provide.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] We have the authority of the Hubgh Case for the statement that the earlier Spanish law was to the contrary effect. 6 La.

On December 22, 1920, a petition was filed against the Ajax Dress Company a manufacturing or mercantile corporation of the State of New York and it was adjudicated a bankrupt. The State filed a claim for a tax for the year between November 1, 1920, and October 31, 1921, and for 'penal interest,' under sections 209 \n\n[263 U.S. 493, 495]\n\u00a0\n and 219-c of the Tax Law of New York (Consol.

By section 219-c of the same tax law the tax is to be paid on or before January 1 of each year and if it is not paid the corporation liable shall pay 'in addition to the amount of such tax ... ten per centum of such amount, plus one per centum for each month the tax ... remains unpaid.' The Courts below held that this latter liability was a penalty and therefore not to be allowed, but allowed six per cent. upon the tax as apportioned, to the date of payment. The State says that it is entitled to the statutory interest or none.\n On the main question the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly recognized that the construction of the state law by the State Courts should control, but found nothing nearer than People ex rel. Mutual Trust Co. v. Miller, 177 N. Y. 51, 69 N. E. 124, where a different statute was held to tax the privilege of carrying on the business as actually exercised and therefore to create an apportionable liability. If the State Court should decide that the present act was to be construed in the same way we should bow, but until it does so we must regard the meaning as tolerably plain. The amount to be paid is not determined by the business done during the period taxed but by the net income of the year before. It is made a legal duty, by what the Courts below rightly held to be \n\n[263 U.S. 493, 496]\n\u00a0\n a penalty, to pay the tax in advance. When the law discussed in the Mutual Trust Company's Case, supra, was amended so as to provide that the tax should be payable in advance, the Court of Appeals said that the amendment changed the character of the tax and that the grounds of the former decision were no longer applicable. People ex rel. New York Central & Hudson River R. R. Co. v. Gaus, 200 N. Y. 328, 93 N. E. 988. It hardly can be supposed that if the tax had been paid the State would recognize a claim for a proportionate return. We are of opinion that the tax is a tax upon the right conferred, not upon the actual exercise of it, that it was due when the petition in bankruptcy was filed, New Jersey v. Anderson, \n203 U.S. 483\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 137, 494, and that the claim of the State for the whole sum should have been allowed.\n There can be no doubt that the additional ten per centum charged for failure to pay by January 1 is a penalty, disallowed by the Bankruptcy Act ,  57j (Comp. St.  9641), but it is urged that the one per centum for each month of default is statutory interest and that the State is entitled to that and otherwise would be entitled to none. As the one per centum is more than the value of the use of the money and is added by the statute to the ten to make a single sum it must be treated as part of one corpus and must fall with that. We presume that in this event the State does not object to receiving the simple interest allowed. That part of the order will stand.\n Order reversed. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEORIA & P. U. RY. CO. v. U S(1924)\nNo. 318\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. R. V. Fletcher, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Messrs. Blackburn Esterline, of Chicago, Ill., and P. J. Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[263 U.S. 528, 529]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. Granville Curry, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 528, 530]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Donald Evans, of Des Moinse, Iowa, for Minneapolis 3 St. L. R. Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Transportation Act 1920 confers upon the Interstate Commerce Commission authority to issue, in certain classes of cases, orders 'with or without notice, hearing, or the making or filing of a report,' if it finds that an emergency exists. Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91,  402, 41 Stat. 456, 476, 477, 486 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563).\n Purporting to act under this power, the Commission ordered, without notice or hearing, that the Peoria & \n\n[263 U.S. 528, 531]\n\u00a0\n Pekin Union Railway Company 'continue to interchange freight traffic between the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad Company and connecting carriers at the regularly established interchange points at and in the vicinity of Peoria, Ill.' This order required the terminal company to switch, by its own engines and over its own tracks, freight cars tendered to it by, or for, the Minneapolis & St. Louis, a service which it had threatened to discontinue because the payment demanded therefor had been refused. \n1\n The Peoria Company insisted that the Commission was without authority under its emergency power to require one carrier to switch cars for another, and brought this suit against the United States in the federal court for Southern Illnois to enjoin the enforcement of the order. The Commission and the Minneapolis & St. Louis intervened as defendants. The case was heard upon application for a temporary injunction, the injunction was denied, and the Peoria Company took a direct appeal to this court under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (Comp. St.  998).\n It is conceded that the Commission could, under its general powers and upon appropriate procedure, order a terminal company to perform a service of this character. But under the general powers of the Commission this could be done only after full hearing, and such an order would ordinarily not take effect under the law until 30 days after service. \n2\n It is also conceded that the existing \n\n[263 U.S. 528, 532]\n\u00a0\n conditions were such as to justify entry of the order under the emergency powers, if these include the requiring of switching. The objection urged is that the emergency power conferred is limited to orders which direct the manner in which transportation service shall be rendered or which prescribe the use to be made of railroad property, and that no such authority is granted to require performance of a transportation service. The substantive question presented is one of statutory construction-the scope of the emergency power.\n The Commission possessed no emergency power prior to the so-called Esch Car Service Act, May 29, 1917, c. 23, 40 Stat. 101 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  8563).3 Its provisions were amended by Transportation Act 1920, and in the amended form are introduced as paragraphs 15 and 16 of section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce and as paragraph 4 of section 15. 41 Stat. 476, 477, 486 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563, 8583). Paragraph 15 deals in subparagraphs (a) and (b) with car service; in subparagraph (c) with the common use of terminals; in subparagraph (d) with preferences in transportation, embargoes, and movement of traffic under permits. Paragraph 16 and the amendment to section 15 confer emergency power to reroute traffic and 'to establish temporarily, such through routes as in its [the Commission's] opinion are necessary or desirable in the public interest.' None of these provisions grants in terms power to require the performance of a transportation service. The specific grant in paragraph 16 of emergency power to 'make such just and reasonable directions with respect to the handling, routing, and movement of the traffic of such carrier and its distribution over other lines of roads,' and the omission of any reference to switching, tend to rebut an intention to grant the power here asserted. The order cannot be justified \n\n[263 U.S. 528, 533]\n\u00a0\n as dealing with preferences in transportation or embargoes under subparagraph (d). Nor does the order provide for the joint use of terminals under subparagraph (c),4 since it does not purport to authorize the Minneapolis & St. Louis to use the tracks and terminals of the Peoria Company. The contentions mainly urged are that the order is one concerning car service under subparagraph (b),5 or that power to require switching should be held to have been granted by implication.\n The argument that the authority of the Commission over car service should be construed to include the requiring of switching rests upon paragraph 10 of amended section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce. \n6\n But 'car service' connotes the use to which the vehicles of transportation are put; not the transportation service rendered by means of them. \n7\n Cars and locomotives, like tracks and terminals, are the instrumentalities. To make these instru mentalities \n\n[263 U.S. 528, 534]\n\u00a0\n available in emergencies to a carrier other than the owner was the sole purpose of subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c). It is to this end only, that provision is made by paragraph 10 for the 'movement, distribution, exchange, interchange, and return of locomotives, cars, and other vehicles used in the transportation of property.' This is substantially the same expression as was used in the Esch Car Service Act. The 1920 act merely adds locomotives and other vehicles.\n Transportation Act 1920 evinces, in many provisions, the intention of Congress to place upon the Commission the administrative duty of preventing interruptions in traffic. But there is no general grant of emergency power \n\n[263 U.S. 528, 535]\n\u00a0\n to that end, and the detail in which the subjects of such power have been specified precludes its extension to other subjects by implication. Moreover, switching service differs in character from those as to which such power is expressly granted. These involve either the use by one carrier of property of another or the direction of the manner and the means by which the service of transportation shall be performed. The switching order here in question compels performance of the primary duty to receive and transport cars of a connecting carrier. That courts may enforce such duties by a mandatory injunction, including a preliminary restraining order, has long been recognized. \n8\n It may be that Congress refrained, for this reason, from conferring emergency power of this character upon the Commission.\n The United States contends, also, that the decree dismissing the bill should be affirmed, because under the Act of Cotober 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 220, the proper venue was the district of Iowa, that being the residence of the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad. Compare Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 504\n, 505 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 170; Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 563\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 375. The provision that suit shall be brought in the district of the residence of the party on whose petition the order was made is obviously one inserted for his benefit. \n9\n If there \n\n[263 U.S. 528, 536]\n\u00a0\n were a lack of jurisdiction in the District Court over the subjectmatter, we should be obliged to take notice of the defect, even if not urged below by the appellee. Mattingly v. Northwestern Virginia R. Co., \n158 \nU.S. 53, 57\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 725. But the challenge is merely of the jurisdiction of the court for the particular district. The objection is to the venue. See Camp v. Gress, \n250 \nU.S. 308, 311\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 478. This privilege not to be sued elsewhere can be waived, and it was waived both by the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad and the Commission. The United States was, nevertheless, entitled to insist upon compliance with the venue provision, and its objection was properly taken below. But, by failure to enter a cross-appeal from the court's action in overruling its objection, the right to insist upon it here was lost. The appellees can be heard before this court only in support of the decree which was rendered. The Maria Martin, 12 Wall. 31, 40; Bolles v. Outing Co., \n175 \nU.S. 262, 268\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 94.

As amended the term is made to include the use, control, supply, movement, distribution, etc., not only of cars, but of locomotives and other vehicles. It is further extended to include, 'the supply, movement, and operation of trains by any carrier by railroad subject to this act' and so requires every carrier by railroad 'to furnish safe and adequate car service.\" House Report 456, 66th Congress, 1st Session, p. 17.

You know we have had emergent conditions throughout the country many times in recent years. We want the Commission to act, promptly on the spur of the moment in case of emergency in order to prevent congestion at terminals; in order to route traffic around a congested terminal so that it may reach its destination at the earliest possible date; in order to ship foods over the most direct route regardless of instructions contained in the bills of lading.

Swiger, both of New York City, for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. George Ross Hull, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Perkins-Campbell Company filed its petition asking the reformation of an award made it under the provisions of the Dent Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 14\/45 a-3115 14\/15 e) of compensation for expenses incurred in the partial performance of a war contract for the manufacture of ambulance harness; and the allowance of additional \n\n[264 U.S. 213, 214]\n\u00a0\n compensation. This petition was dismissed on demurrer, without an opinion. 57 Ct. Cl. 623.\n The material facts set forth in the petition and appearing from the exhibits are On August 10, 1917, the Company entered in to a contract with the War Department, designated as No. 2788, for the manufacture of 35,000 sets of ambulance harness. This contract was not executed in the manner prescribed by law. After the Company had delivered 3,000 sets of harness and incurred expenses for the manufacture of the full number, negotiations were had for a reduction of the contract to 20,000 sets. This resulted in a written offer by the Company to 'allow 15,000 sets of this harness without expense to the Government with the understanding that we are to be allotted 10,000 dump cart harness,' at a specified higher price. On October 22, 1918, the Quartermaster General's Office wrote the Company that 15,000 sets of ambulance harness had been cancelled from its contract, and that in lieu of this cancellation an award had been made it for 10,000 sets of cart harness at the higher price, 'on Contract L-357-J,' which was being prepared and would shortly be forwarded for signature. The next day the Quartermaster General's Office telegraphed:\n'Telegram referring to 10,000 dump cart harness received. Cancellation and award of 10,000 sets approved. Contract now before Review Board but has not been approved by them. Use your own judgment in cutting harness. Will notify you when contract is approved.'\n\n The Company, expecting that the duly executed contract would follow shortly, but without intending, the petition avers, to surrender otherwise its right to deliver the 35,000 sets of ambulance harness, suspended the production of more than 20,000 sets of ambulance harness and proceeded to prepare for the manufacture of the cart harness 'in so far as it might do so without risk of serious loss if the contract were not executed.' In so doing it incurred expenses of more than \n\n[264 U.S. 213, 215]\n\u00a0\n $70,000. Shortly after the Armistice, and before the new contract had been executed, the Company, at the request of the Quartermaster General's Office, suspended the further manufacture of both the ambulance and the cart harness.\n After the passage of the Dent Act, 40 Stat. 1272, c. 94-which authorized the Secretary of War to adjust claims for expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution of the war under 'an agreement, express or implied,' entered into in good faith but not executed as prescribed by law- the Company presented to the War Department Claims Board, the designated agent of the Secretary, two claims for compensation: One for all expenses incurred in the performance of Contract 2788 for 35,000 sets of ambulance harness; and the other for expenses incurred under the 'proposed contract L-357-J' for cart harness. Each was in the form prescribed for claims based on 'agreements' reduced to contract form or otherwise established by written evidence. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The Claims Board, in accordance with its rules of procedure,2 made a certificate setting forth that an agreement had been entered into as shown by Contract 2788, and, after this had been approved by the Company, forwarded the claim under this contract to a Zone Board for detailed examination. A certificate as to the agreement entered into under 'Contract L-357-J,' was made a week later. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Zone Board, deciding that the Company had surrendered its right to deliver 15,000 sets of the ambulance \n\n[264 U.S. 213, 216]\n\u00a0\n harness, rejected the claim on the basis of 35,000 sets, and 'instructed' the Company to submit it on the basis of 20,000 sets only. The Company, in obedience to these 'instructions,' revised its claim so as to exclude all expenses incurred as to more than 20,000 sets. And, the petition avers, a captain and a lieutenant attached to the Zone Board, 'believed' by the Company to be acting under its direction, 'instructed' the Company that it might accept an award based on its expenses for 20,000 sets without waiving its claim for those incurred for the additional 15,000 sets. The Zone Board, upon proof submitted as to 20,000 sets only, found the amount of compensation to which the Company was entitled and recommended payment. Pursuant to such recommendation, the Claims Board, in December, 1919, made an award to the Company under 'Contract 2788.' This award, after reciting that an agreement had been entered into on August 10, 1917, as set out in the certificate of the Board, awarded the Company, in addition to the payments for the ambulance harness that had been delivered,4 and as remuneration for the expenses incurred in preparing to perform said agreement, the further sum of $80,385.15 'in full adjustment, payment and discharge of said agreement.' This award was accepted by the Company by written endorsement; and was duly paid. The petition avers, however, that although this award purported to be a settlement of all obligations of the Government under Contract 2788, it 'was not the intention of the claimant nor of the officers with whom the settlement covered by the award was negotiated to settle thereunder any claim of the claimant beyond 20,000 sets.'\n On the same day the Claims Board made the Company an award under 'Contract L-357-J.' This award after reciting that an agreement had been entered into on or \n\n[264 U.S. 213, 217]\n\u00a0\n about October 22, 1918, the terms of which had been set out in a certificate of the Board, awarded the Company as remuneration for the expenses incurred in preparing to perform 'said agreement,' the sum of $71, 705.76, in full adjustment and discharge of 'said agreement.' This award was also accepted by the Company by written endorsement; and was duly paid.\n Meanwhile the Company had filed, in June, 1919, pursuant, as the petition avers, to 'instructions' of the Zone Board, a claim with the Board of Contract Adjustment for the expenses incurred in the performance of the ambulance harness contract not included in the 20,000 sets. In March, 1920, the Board of Contract Adjustment decided that the United States, having paid the awards as to 20,000 sets of ambulance harness and the 10,000 sets of cart harness, was under no obligation to reimburse the Company for expenses as to the 15,000 sets of ambulance harness 'which were eliminated' from the original contract. 4 Dec. War Dept., Bd. Cont. Adjust., 529, 531. This decision was affirmed by the Secretary of War, who found that the original order for 15,000 sets of ambulance harness 'was cancelled with the consent of claimant without cost to the Government.'\n The petition prays that the court adjudge that the award made and accepted under Contract 2788 did not express the intention of the parties and reform it so as to express their intention that it should constitute a settlement of that part only of the contract covering 20,000 sets of ambulance harness; and that the Company be awarded the further sum of $21, 868.89 for expenses incurred in preparing to manufacture the 15,000 additional sets covered by the contract.\n The demurrer to the petition is based upon the ground, among others, that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the United States or entitle the Company to the relief prayed for. \n\n[264 U.S. 213, 218]\n\u00a0\n Aside from any other question, it is clear that, under the averments of the petition, the Company is not entitled to the reformation of the award accepted by it in full discharge of the obligations of the United States under the original contract for the ambulance harness. The reformation of this award is clearly a prerequisite to any recovery for expenses incurred in reference to the 15,000 sets. The petition, however, shows no facts sufficient to require such a reformation.\n The fact that the Company had been advised by a captain and a lieutenant 'believed' to be acting under the directions of the Zone Board, that it might accept an award on the basis of 20,000 sets without waiving its claim as to the 15,000 additional sets, is, obviously, not a sufficient ground for reformation of the award which it subsequently accepted, deliberately, in 'full discharge' of the contract. And the general allegation that neither the Company nor the officers with whom the settlement was negotiated intended to settle under the award any claim beyond 20,000 sets, is a mere conclusion of the pleader, at least in so far as the intention of the Government is concerned. The petition does not designate the officers referred to or show their authority to bind the United States in any respect whatever. And it does not aver that the award was in fact the result of any negotiation for settlement. On the contrary the award appears to have been an adjudication made by the Claims Board upon the facts, when it had before it the claim under the agreement as to the cart harness as well as that under the original contract for the ambulance harness. There is no averment that the Claims Board in making the award intended it as only a partial settlement of the claims under the contract for the ambulance harness, or that it was paid by the authorized agents of the United States with any such understanding.\n Manifestly the averments of fact contained in the petition show no 'mutual mistake of the parties which upon \n\n[264 U.S. 213, 219]\n\u00a0\n well-established principles of equity jurisprudence requires the reformation of the contract, and certainly no such special circumstances ... of fraud, duress, or oppression, as would necessarily require relief against a mistake of law.'

Hammock, of Little Rock, Ark., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Arkansas provides that one who sells gasoline to be used by the purchaser in motor vehicles on highways of the state 'shall collect from such purchaser in addition to the usual charge therefor, the sum of one cent (1) per gallon for each gallon so sold'; that the dealer shall register with the county clerk in every county in which he does business, shall file each month a report of the sales made within the county during the preceding month, and shall personally pay over each month the amount of the taxes accrued thereon; and that failure to file the report or to pay such amount is a misdemeanor which subjects the dealer to a fine. Act No. 606, approved March 29, 1921, Acts of Arkansas 1921, p. 685. To enjoin the enforcement of the law the Pierce Oil Corporation brought, in the federal court for Western Arkansas, this suit against taxing officials. The trial court dismissed the bill, without opinion. Its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 282 Fed. 253. The case is here under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218). Whether the statute is valid is the sole question for decision. The claims are that the statute violates the due process clause of the federal Constitution, and that it is void for uncertainty. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[264 U.S. 137, 139]\n\u00a0\n The claim that the act violates the due process clause rests upon the argument that the tax levied is a privilege tax for the use of the highways by the purchasers; that the seller is required to pay the tax laid on the purchasers; that, unlike those cases where a bank is required to pay taxes assessed against stockholders or depositors (Citizens' National Bank v. Kentucky, \n217 U.S. 443\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 532; Clement National Bank v. Vermont, \n231 U.S. 120\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 31), the seller is not afforded the means of reimbursing himself; and that, moreover, the mere process of collecting the tax from the purchaser, and making monthly reports and payments, subjects the seller to an appreciable expense. A short answer to this argument is that the seller is directed to collect the tax from the purchaser when he makes the sale, and that a state which has, under its Constitution, power to regulate the business of selling gasoline (and doubtless, also, the power to tax the privilege of carrying on that business) is not prevented by the due process clause from imposing the incidental burden.\n The claim that the law is void for uncertainty is not urged as a violation of the due process clause. Compare International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 216\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 853; Fox v. Washington, \n236 U.S. 273\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 383. The argument that there inheres in the statute such uncertainty as to render it a nullity is answered by the fact that, since the judgment was entered in the trial court, all uncertainty has been removed by the decision of the highest court of the state in Standard Oil Co. v. Brodie, 153 Ark. 114, 239 S. W. 753. There the act was construed as requiring sellers to collect and pay the tax only on such gasoline as they have reason to believe purchasers from them will use in motors on highways.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the District Court the plaintiff challenged the validity of the law also under the state Constitution. But after the appeal was taken the statute was upheld by the highest court of the state in Standard Oil Co. v. Brodie, 153 Ark. 114, 239 S. W. 753. So that question is not before us. In this court it was argued that statute violates the equal protection clause. As the contention was not made below, it is not considered. That the remedy at law was not adequate is conceded. \n\n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPRESTONETTES, INC. v. COTY(1924)\nNo. 197\nArgued: Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles H. Tuttle and Louis Marshall, both of New York City, and Wm. J. Hughes, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.[ Prestonettes, Inc. v. Coty \n264 U.S. 359\n (1924) ]\n\n\n[264 U.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Asher Blum, of New York City, Lindley M. Garrison, of Jersey City N. J., F. D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., and Hugo Mock, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[264 U.S. 359, 366]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by the respondent, Coty, a citizen of France, against Prestonettes, a New York corporation, having its principal place of business in the Southern District of New York. It seeks to restrain alleged unlawful uses of the Plaintiff's registered trade- marks, 'Coty' and 'L'Origan' upon toilet powders and perfumes. The defendant purchases the genuine powder, subjects it to pressure, adds a binder to give it coherence and sells the compact in a metal case. It buys \n\n[264 U.S. 359, 367]\n\u00a0\n the genuine perfume in bottles and sells it in smaller bottles. We need not mention what labels it used before this suit as the defendant is content to abide by the decree of the District Court. That decree allowed the defendant to put upon the rebottled perfume 'Prestonettes, Inc., not connected with Coty, states that the contents are Coty's [giving the name of the article] independently rebottled in New York.' every word to be in letters of the same size, color, type and general distinctiveness. It allowed the defendant to make compacts from the genuine loose powder of the plaintiff and to sell them with this label on the container, 'Prestonettes, Inc., not connected with Coty, states that the compact of face powder herein was independently compounded by it from Coty's [giving the name] loose powder and its own binder. Loose powder-per cent., Binder- per cent.,' every word to be in letters of the same size, color, type and general distinctiveness. The Circuit Court of Appeals, considering the very delicate and volatile nature of the perfume, its easy deterioration, and the opportunities for adulteration, issued an absolute preliminary injunction against the use of the above marks except on the original packages as marked and sold by the plaintiff, thinking that the defendant could not put upon the plaintiff the burden of keeping a constant watch. 285 Fed. 501, certiorari granted, \n260 U.S. 720\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 250.\n The bill does not charge the defendant with adulterating or otherwise deteriorating the plaintiff's product except that it intimates rather than alleges metal containers to be bad, and the Circuit Court of Appeals stated that there were no controverted questions of fact but that the issue was simply one of law. It seemingly assumed that the defendant handled the plaintiff's product without in any way injuring its qualities and made its decree upon that assumption. The decree seems to us to have gone too far. \n\n[264 U.S. 359, 368]\n\u00a0\n The defendant of course by virtue of its ownership had a right to compound or change what it bought, to divide either the original or the modified product, and to sell it so divided. The plaintiff could not prevent or complain of its stating the nature of the component parts and the source from which they were derived if it did not use the trade-mark in doing so. For instance, the defendant could state that a certain percentage of its compound was made at a certain place in Paris, however well known as the plaintiff's factory that place might be. If the compound was worse than the constituent, it might be a misfortune to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff would have no cause of action, as the defendant was exercising the rights of ownership and only telling the truth. The existence of a trademark would have no bearing on the question. Then what new rights does the trade-mark confer? It does not confer a right to prohibit the use of the word or words. It is not a copyright. The argument drawn from the language of the Trade-Mark Act does not seem to us to need discussion. A trade-mark only gives the right to prohibit the use of it so far as to protect the owner's good will against the sale of another's product as his. United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., \n248 \nU.S. 90, 97\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 48. There is nothing to the contrary in A. Bourjois & Co. v. Katzel, \n260 U.S. 689\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 244, 26 A. L. R. 567. There the trade-mark protected indicated that the goods came from the plaintiff in the United States, although not made by it, and therefore could not be put upon other goods of the same make coming from abroad. When the mark is used in a way that does not deceive the public we see no such sanctity in the word as to prevent its being used to tell the truth. It is not taboo. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 327.\n If the name Coty were allowed to be printed in different letters from the rest of the inscription dictated by the District Court a casual purchaser might look no \n\n[264 U.S. 359, 369]\n\u00a0\n further and might be deceived. But when it in no way stands out from the statements of facts that unquestionably the defendant has a right to communicate in some form, we see no reason why it should not be used collaterally, not to indicate the goods, but to say that the trade-marked product is a constituent in the article now offered as new and changed. As a general proposition there can be no doubt that the word might be so used. If a man bought a barrel of a certain flour, or a demijohn of Old Crow whisky, he certainly could sell the flour in smaller packages or in former days could have sold the whisky in bottles, and tell what it was, if he stated that he did the dividing up or the bottling. And this would not be because of a license implied from the special facts but on the general ground that we have stated. It seems to us that no new right can be evoked from the fact that the perfume or powder is delicate and likely to be spoiled, or from the omnipresent possibility of fraud. If the defendant's rebottling the plaintiff's perfume deteriorates it and the public is adequately informed who does the rebottling, the public, with or without the plaintiff's assistance, is likely to find it out. And so of the powder in its new form.\n This is not a suit for unfair competition. It stands upon the plaintiff's rights as owner of a trade-mark registered under the Act of Congress. The question therefore is not how far the court would go in aid of a plaintiff who showed ground for suspecting the defendant of making a dishonest use of his opportunities, but is whether the plaintiff has the naked right alleged to prohibit the defendant from making even a collateral reference to the plaintiff's mark. We are of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and that that of the District Court must stand.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUGET SOUND POWER & LIGHT CO. v.

Hanson and Malcolm Douglas, both of Seattle, Wash., for defendants in error, in support of the motion.\n Messrs. James B. Howe, of Seattle, Wash., Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., and Thomas J. L. Kennedy, Walter B. Beals and Walter F. Meier, all of Seattle, Wash., for plaintiffs in error, in opposition to the motion.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Puget Sound Power & Light Company owned a street railway part of which was in Seattle. This part it sold to the city in 1919. In the contract of purchase it was agreed that if when the deed was delivered any lien should have attached to the property for the taxes of 1919, it should not constitute a breach of warranty, and the tax should be paid in amounts proportioned to the parts of the year during which the parties were respectively in possession. The deed was delivered March 31, 1919, and possession then taken. On March 15, 1919, an assessment had been made by the tax commissioner of the state on the operating property of the street railway, including that part then contracted to be sold to the city. The power company brought this suit in the superior court of King county, Wash ., against the county and its taxing authorities, the state tax commissioner, and the city of Seattle to restrain the collection of taxes under the assessment as illegal. The superior court dismissed the complaint. Its action was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, and this is a writ of error to that court. The case comes before us on a motion to dismiss or affirm.\n The first ground for the motion is that the writ of error was not taken within the time allowed by law. By the \n\n[264 U.S. 22, 24]\n\u00a0\n Act of September 6, 1916 (chapter 448,  6, 39 Stat. 727 [Comp St.  1228a ]), it is provided that no writ of error intended to bring any cause for review to this court shall be allowed or entertained unless duly applied for within three months after entry of the judgment or decree complained of. The Washington Supreme Court sits in two departments and en banc. The Second Department filed its opinion October 15, 1921. The case was reargued before the court en banc, which in a per curiam opinion filed June 12, 1922, approved the decision of the Second Department and affirmed the judgment. On July 10th there was entered on the minutes of the court the following:\n'Judgment.\n\n'This cause having been heretofore submitted to the court, upon the transcript of the record of the superior court of King county, ... and the court having fully considered the same, and being fully advised in the premises, it is now, on this 10th day of July, A. D. 1922, ... considered, adjudged, and decreed that the judgment of the said superior court be, and the same is, hereby affirmed, with costs.'\n\n The contention is that the per curiam opinion filed June 12th was under the Constitution and laws of Washington the judgment from which the time for allowance of the writ of error from this court began to run, and that the period thus expired on September 12, 1922, whereas the writ of error herein was not applied for until September 22d. Under the law of Washington (sections 10 and 11 of Remington's Compiled Statutes of Washington of 1922) a decision of a department of the Supreme Court does not become final until 30 days after it is filed, during which a petition for rehearing may be filed. If no rehearing is asked for, or no order entered for a hearing en banc, in the 30 days, the decision becomes final. If a hearing en banc is ordered and had, as here, the decision is \n\n[264 U.S. 22, 25]\n\u00a0\n final when filed; but in all cases where the decision is final there is a specific provision that a judgment shall issue thereon. It is apparent that, however final the decision may be, it is not the judgment. It is said that the latter is a mere formal ministerial entry of a clerical character, whereas the real judgment is the final decision. Whatever the effect of the distinction in the procedure of the state, which counsel seek to make, we are in no doubt that that which the Washington statute calls the judgment is the judgment referred to in the Act of Congress of September 6, 1916, supra, fixing the time in which writs of error must be applied for and allowed. The motion to dismiss the writ granted the power company must be denied.\n A separate motion to dismiss is directed against the city of Seattle which appears as a plaintiff in error with the street railway company. It was made a defendant in the superior court by the company. It filed an answer supporting the averments of the complaint and a cross-complaint against its co-defendants, asking the same relief as that asked in the complaint. It took a separate appeal to the Supreme Court of the state. No evidence appears in the record that it raised an objection based on the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution, or any other federal question, in the superior court or Supreme Court. It is too late for the city to raise it in the assignment of errors in this court, even though it joins in the assignment with the street railway company, which did raise such an objection in all the courts. Sully v. American National Bank, \n178 \nU.S. 289, 297\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 935. It is difficult to see how, under Trenton v. New Jersey, \n262 U.S. 182\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 534, and like cases, the city could have been heard as against the state to complain of state taxes on the ground that they violated the Fourteenth Amendment; but it is not necessary to decide this. The motion to dismiss the writ of the city must be granted for the reason first stated. \n\n[264 U.S. 22, 26]\n\u00a0\n We come now to the motion to affirm the judgment against the power company. By objections seasonably taken before both state courts and in the assignment of errors, the power company questioned the validity of the Act of February 21, 1911, of the Legislature of Washington (Laws of Washington 1911, p. 62) amending an act of the same body of March 6, 1907 ( section 12, chapter 78, Session Laws of 1907) under which the taxes complained of were assessed. Before 1911, the laws of Washington provided for a separate assessment of the real estate and of the personalty of a street railway. By the act of that year, this was changed and it was provided 'that all of the operating property of street railroads shall be assessed and taxed as personal property.' The effect of this act so far as the real estate of the street railway used in its operation was concerned was, first, to fix the day of payment of the taxes as on March 15th in each year, in accord with the law as to taxes on personalty, instead of May 31st, the day fixed for the payment of real estate taxes, with an option in the real estate taxpayer to postpone payment of one-half of his tax until November 30th; second, to impose 15 per centum as interest after delinquency, instead of 12 per centum interest as on real estate tax delinquency; and, third, to authorize a sale of the property taxed on 10 days' notice after delinquency without any right of redemption while the sale of real estate for delinquency is longer delayed and a period of redemption is reserved.\n It is insisted that to make these differences between the taxation of real estate of a street railway and that of other railroads, other corporations and individuals, is to deny owners of street railway property equal protection of the laws.\n The act of 1911 treated the operating street railway property as a business unit, as a machine consisting of cars, tracks, street easements, wires, power houses and \n\n[264 U.S. 22, 27]\n\u00a0\n all the parts of one system. More than half of this total is probably personalty. Much of the realty is mere easements in the streets. The assets of a street railway differ widely from those of the steam commercial railways that own the land upon which their tracks are laid, that have most extensive terminals and whose business is of a radically different character. A separate treatment of these two classes of railroads for taxation has been sustained by this court because of these manifest differences. Savannah Railroad Co. v. Mayor, \n198 U.S. 392\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 690; People v. Board of Tax Commissioners, \n199 U.S. 1\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 705, 4 Ann. Cas. 381. A street railway is sui generis. It is not necessarily to be regarded as real estate. Its value is made of uncertain factors. When its franchise to do business expires, its easement in the streets usually terminates, and its rails become but scrap steel. We do not think, considering the very wide discretion a Legislature has in such a case, that it was arbitrary to tax the whole street railway unit as personalty. That such a change in this case entailed no real hardship or arbitrary discrimination is shown by the fact that, before the new method of treating street railway property was enforced, the tax agent of the street railway company for several years requested that realty and personalty be taxed in solido.\n We are considering this case only from the standpoint of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. The objections based on the state Constitution of Washington have been settled adversely and conclusively for us by the decision herein of the state Supreme Court. Counsel cite us cases which have little relation to the federal question before us. Johnson v. Wells Fargo & Co., \n239 U.S. 234\n, 36 Sup Ct. 62; Ewert v. Taylor, 38 S. D. 124, 160 N. W. 797; State ex rel. Owen, Attorney General, v. Donald, Secretary of State, 161 Wis. 188, 153 N. W. 238, and like cases involved the application of somewhat stringent provisions of state Constitutions as to equality of taxation on \n\n[264 U.S. 22, 28]\n\u00a0\n all kinds of property which left but little room for classification. Such restrictions have much embarrassed state Legislatures because actual equality of taxation is unattainable. The theoretical operation of a tax is often very different from its practical incidence due to the weakness of human nature and anxiety to escape tax burdens. This justifies the Legislature where the Constitution does not forbid in adopting variant provisions as to the rate, the assessment, and the collection for different kinds of property. The reports of this court are full of cases which demonstrate that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended and is not to be construed as having any such object as these stiff and unyielding requirements of equality in state Constitutions. No better statement of the unvarying attitude of this court on this subject can be found than in the often quoted language of Mr. Justice Bradley in speaking for the court in Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 533, 535 (33 L. Ed. 892):\n'The provision in the Fourteenth Amendment, that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, was not intended to prevent a state from adjusting its system of taxation in all proper and reasonable ways. It may, if it chooses, exempt certain classes of property from any taxation at all, such as churches, libraries, and the property of charitable institutions. It may impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions, and may vary the rates of excise upon various products; it may tax real estate and personal property in a different manner; it may tax visible property only, and not tax securities for payment of money; it may allow deductions for indebtedness, or not allow them. All such regulations, and those of like character, so long as they proceed within reasonable limits and general usage, are within the discretion of the state Legislature, or the people of the state in framing their Constitution. But clear and hostile discriminations \n\n[264 U.S. 22, 29]\n\u00a0\n against particular persons and classes, especially such as are of an unusual character, unknown to the practice of our governments, might be obnoxious to the constitutional prohibition. It would, however, be impracticable and unwise to attempt to lay down any general rule or definition on the subject, that would include all cases. They must be decided as they arise. We think that we are safe in saying that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to compel the state to adopt an iron rule of equal taxation.'\n\n Clearly there is nothing of an unusual character in the method adopted in this case for the assessment and collection of taxes upon street railways. The general practice of providing special methods of estimating the burden of taxation which this peculiar kind of property should bear is well known and proves that it justifies a separate classification.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nQUEEN INS.

Roger Englar, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 487, 490]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Van Vechten Veeder, of New york City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel in admiralty upon a New York policy insuring cargo on the Italian steamship Napoli lost by collision in the Mediterranean, in or near the Gulf of Lyons, on July 4, 1918. The libellant also in New York had insured the cargo concerned against marine risks and the libellee had insured it against war risks. Each company by agreement paid half the loss subject to adjustment and took an assignment of the claim of the assured against the other. The main question in the case is whether the loss was covered by the libellee's policy as the libellant contends. We were asked to assume that the exception of 'all consequences ... of hostilities or warlike operations' in the marine policy and the liability for 'acts of kings, princes and people authorized by and in prosecution of hostilities between belligerent nations' assumed by the libellee were coextensive. For the purpose of argument we shall do so. The courts below in deference to the English decisions held that the loss could not be attributed to warlike operations. There was a difference of opinion as to whether the collision was due to faulty navigation, but all the judges agreed that it was expedient to follow the English law. (D. C.) 278 Fed. 770; (C. C. A.) 282 Fed. 976. \n\n[263 U.S. 487, 491]\n\u00a0\n It will not be necessary to state the facts in detail. They are fully set forth in the decisions below but those that are material to our conclusion need but a few words. The Napoli sailed from New York for Genoa with a cargo of which a part was intended for the Italian Government and a small part was munitions of war. All of it was contraband. At Gibraltar she joined a convoy, as it was practically necessary to do although not ordered by the military powers. The convoy sailed with screened lights, protected by British, Italian and American war vessels, and navigated by an Italian commander on the Napoli, subject to the command of a British captain as the senior naval officer present. The route to be followed was ordered beforehand up to a point where instructions from Genoa were to be received but were not, as the convey was ahead of the scheduled time. At about midnight July 4 another convoy similarly commanded met this one head on. It was seen only a very few minutes before the meeting, there was much confusion, and one of its vessels, the Lamington, a British steamship, struck the Napoli and sank her. As our judgment is based on broader grounds we do not describe the movements bearing upon the nice question whether the navigation of the Napolior or the Lamington was in fault.\n To show that the loss is to be attributed to warlike operations the petitioner points to sailing under convoy and without lights, both made necessary by the war, as enough. To this it adds that the cargo of the Napoli was an aid in carrying on the struggle, a matter of special importance in the late war, where the issue depended so largely on supplies, where, as it was put by Hough, J., below 'commerce existed only as an adjunct to war'; that the routes and particulars of navigation were determined by naval command; and that the naval authorities were responsible for the meeting of the two convoys without previous notice. It urges with plausibilty that the \n\n[263 U.S. 487, 492]\n\u00a0\n collision would not have happened but for the proceedings thus prescribed as an essential part of the conduct of the war. As corroborating its large interpretation of 'consequences of hostilities or warlike operations' it states that while the premiums upon war risk insurance were greatly increased those upon marine risks underwent but little change.\n On the other hand the common understanding is that in construing these policies we are not to take broad views but generally are to stop our inquiries with the cause nearest to the loss. This is a settled rule of construction, and if it is understood, does not deserve much criticism, since theoretically at least the parties can shape their contract as they like. Morgan v. United States, 14 Wall. 531, applied this rule beyond the limits of insurance to a charter party made during the Civil War, by which the United States assumed the war risks and the owners were to bear to the marine risks. The boat carrying troops and stores was compelled to put to sea by the orders of a quartermaster given to meet what he thought the exigency of the service although the danger was obvious and the master and pilot advised against it. This Court recognized the hardship of the owners' case in view of the peremptory order to proceed to sea but declined to look beyond the wind and waves that were the immediate cause of the loss. A similar decision was reached by the House of Lords after the late war in a case where the chartered vessel, The Petersham, was sailing without lights because of Admiralty regulations and collided with a Spanish vessel also without lights, and it was found that because of the absence of lights the collision could not have been avoided by reasonable care. Britain Steamship Co. v. The King, \n\n[263 U.S. 487, 1921]\n\u00a0\n 1 A. C. 99, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, \n\n[263 U.S. 487, 1919]\n\u00a0\n 2 K. B. 670. See Morgan v. United States, 5 Ct. Cl. 182, 194; Reybold v. United States, 5 Ct. Cl. 277, 283, 284. \n\n[263 U.S. 487, 493]\n\u00a0\n The same principle was applied to insurance, the special field of this narrow construction, in the case of The Matiana heard and decided with the Petersham, where a vessel was sailing under convoy and struck a reef without negligence on the part of the master or the naval officer in command of the escort. The discussion turned largely on the question whether the remoter causes of the collision and stranding were warlike operations and from the tenor of the arguments on the one side and the other it may be doubted whether Morgan v. United States would not have been thought to go too far. But The Matiana certainly goes as far as the decision below in this case. There are special reasons for keeping in harmony with the marine insurance laws of England, the great field of this business, and as we could not reverse the decision below without overruling Morgan v. United States, we are of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be affirmed. We repeat that we are dealing not with general principles but only with the construction of an ancient form of words which always have been taken in a narrow sense, and in Morgan v.

SHULER(1924)\nNo. 593\nArgued: January 9, 1924Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 371, 372]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William H. Foster, of Syracuse, N. Y., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. E. Clarence Aiken, of Albany, N. Y., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the question of the constitutionality of two recent amendments to the Workmen's Compensation Law of New York, enacted Laws 1913, c. 816; reenacted Laws 1914, c. 41.\n This is a compulsory law establishing in certain employments classed as hazardous an exclusive system governing compensation for injuries to employees resulting in disability or death, irrespective of negligence, and requiring compensation to be paid to injured employees or, in case of death, to designated beneficiaries,1 according to prescribed scales gauged by the previous wages and the extent of the disabilities or dependency of the beneficiaries. The employer is required to insure the payment of such compensation in a State insurance fund or with an authorized stock association or mutual association, unless, upon proof of his financial ability, he is permitted to become a 'self-insurer.' The constitutionality of this law was sustained in New York Central Railroad v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629. \n\n[265 U.S. 371, 373]\n\u00a0\n The Compensation Law was amended by the Laws of 1922, c. 615 (Consol. Laws, c. 67), so as to include, as subdivisions 8 and 9 of section 15, the two provisions involved in this case, which read:\n'8. Permanent Total Disability after Permanent Partial Disability. If an employee who has previously incurred permanent partial disability through the loss of one hand,' arm, foot, leg, or eye, 'incurs permanent total disability through the loss of another member or organ, he shall be paid, in addition to the compensation for permanent partial disability'2 and after the cessation thereof, 'special additional compensation for the remainder of his life to the amount of sixty-six and twothirds per centum of the average weekly wage earned by him at the time the total permanent disability was incurred. Such additional compensation shall be paid out of a special fund created for such purpose in the following manner: The insurance carrier3 shall pay to the state treasurer for every case of injury causing death in which there are no persons entitled to compensation the sum of five hundred dollars. The state treasurer shall be the custodian of this special fund, and the [industrial] commissioner shall direct the distribution thereof.4\n\n'9. Maintenance for Employees Undergoing Vocational Rehabilitation. An employee, who as a result of injury is \n\n[265 U.S. 371, 374]\n\u00a0\n or may be expected to be totally or partially incapacitated for a remunerative occupation and who, under the direction of the state board of vocational education is being rendered fit to engage in a remunerative occupation,5 shall \n\n[265 U.S. 371, 375]\n\u00a0\n receive additional compensation necessary for his maintenance,' but not exceeding ten dollars a week. 'The expense shall be paid out of a special fund created in the following manner: The insurance carrier shall pay to the state treasurer for every case of injury causing death, in which there are no persons entitled to compensation, the sum of $500. The state treasurer shall be the custodian of this special fund and the industrial commissioner shall direct the distribution thereof.'6\n\n In February, 1923, an employee of the Sheehan Company in one of the hazardous occupations, sustained, in the course of his employment, accidental injuries resulting in his death. He left no survivors entitled to compensation. The State Industrial Board, in an appropriate proceeding under the Compensation Law, awarded the State Treasurer against the Sheehan Company, as employer, and the AEtna Life Insurance Company, as insurance carrier, two sums of $500 each, pursuant to subdivisions 8 and 9, respectively, of section 15. On successive appeals these awards were affirmed, without opinions, by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and by the Court of Appeals. State Treasurer v. Sheehan, 206 App. Div. 726, 199 N. Y. Supp. 951; 236 N. Y. 579, 142 N. E. 291. The record was remitted to the Supreme Court, to which this writ of error was directed. Hodges v. Snyder, \n261 U.S. 600\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 435.\n The companies contend that these subdivisions are in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment and that the awards made thereunder deprive them of their property without due process and deny them the equal protection of the laws. \n\n[265 U.S. 371, 376]\n\u00a0\n The substance of these two provisions is that when an injury causes the death of an employee leaving no beneficiaries, the employer or other insurance carrier shall pay the State Treasurer the sum of $500 for each of two special funds: one to be used in paying additional compensation to employees incurring permanent total disability after permanent partial disabilities; and the other, in the vocational education of employees so injured as to need rehabilitation. The use of such special funds for such purposes is an additional compensation to the employees thus injured, over and above that prescribed as the payments to be made by their immediate employers. Such additional compensation is neither unjust nor unreasonable. Thus, an employee who, having lost one hand in a previous accident, thereafter loses the second hand, is, obviously, not adequately compensated by the provision requiring his employer to make payment for the loss of the second hand, independently considered;7 the total incapacity finally resulting from the loss of both hands working much more than double the injury resulting from the loss of each separate hand considered by itself. In such a case, however, as in the case of an injury requiring vocational rehabilitation, it is the theory of the law that such additional compensation to the injured employee should not be required of the particular employer in whose service the injury occurred, but should be provided out of general funds created by payments required of all employers when injuries resulting in the death of their own employees leaving no beneficiaries, do not otherwise create any liability under the Compensation Law.\n We do not think that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that such additional compensation to injured employees of the specified classes, \n\n[265 U.S. 371, 377]\n\u00a0\n should be paid by their immediate employers, or prevents the legislature from providing for its payment out of general funds so created. In Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 244\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 260, 267, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642, it was held that a Workmen's Compensation Act did not deprive the employers of due process, because the compensation to the injured employees and their surviving dependents was not made by their immediate employers, but out of state funds to which the employers were required to make stated contributions, based upon definite percentages of their payrolls, in different groups of industries classified according to hazard. On this question the court said:\n'To the criticism that carefully managed plants are in effect required to contribute to make good the losses arising through the negligence of their competitors, it is sufficient to say that the act recognizes that no management, however careful, can afford immunity from personal injuries to employees in the hazardous occupations, and prescribes that negligence is not to be determinative of the question of the responsibility of the employer or the industry. Taking the fact that accidental injuries are inevitable, in connection with the impossibility of foreseeing when, or in what particular plant or industry they will occur, we deem that the state acted within its power in declaring that no employer should conduct such an industry without making stated and fairly apportioned contributions adequate to maintain a public fund for indemnifying injured employees and the dependents of those killed, irrespective of the particular plant in which the accident might happen to occur. In short, it cannot be deemed arbitrary or unreasonable for the state, instead of imposing upon the particular employer entire responsibility for losses occurring in his own plant or work, to impose the burden upon the industry through a system of occupation taxes limited to the actual losses occurring in the respective classes of occupation.' \n\n[265 U.S. 371, 378]\n\u00a0\n So in the present case the State acted within its power, and neither arbitrarily nor unreasonably, in providing that a portion of the compensation to injured employees in cases coming within the provisions of subdivisions 8 and 9, should not be required in the form of direct payments by their particular employers but should be made from public funds established for that purpose by payments from employers whose own employees leave no beneficiaries.\n\n The payments thus required are not unfair and unreasonable in amount. The aggregate for the two funds is $1,000. This is much less than the maximum payment which may be required according to the scales in case the employee leaves survivors entitled to death benefits, and seems not to exceed, if it equals, the average amount of the payments required in such cases.\n Nor are these provisions in conflict with the equal protection clause. The contention of the companies is that the prescribed awards are in the nature of a tax imposed upon the happening of a contingency, and are of unequal application; that is, that they are imposed only upon such employers as happen to have employees who are killed without leaving survivors entitled to compensation. However, this is not a discrimination between different employers, but merely a contingency on the happening of which all employers alike become subject to the requirements of the law. All are required to contribute, under identical conditions, to these special funds. State Indust. Comm. v. Newman, supra, page 368 (118 N. E. 794).\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A widow (or dependent husband), children under eighteen years of age, or other dependent relatives. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Subdivision 7 of section 15 provides that 'an employee who is suffering from a previous disability shall not receive compensation for a later injury in excess of the compensation allowed for such injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with the previous disability.' See, note 4, infra. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] That is, the state fund, or corporation or association with which an employer has insured, or an employer permitted to become a 'self- insurer.' Section 2. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] This subdivision, which was formerly subdivision 7 of section 15, was incorporated into the Compensation Law by the Laws of 1916, c. 622; the amount of the payment originally prescribed being $100. Awards made to the state treasurer under this provision, in its original form, were sustained in State Indust. Comm. v. Newman, 222 N. Y. 363, 118 N. E. 794, and State Indust. Comm. v. Edsall, 222 N. Y. 651, 119 N. E. 1079 ( affirming 179 App. Div. 431, 165 N. Y. Supp. 967).\n The history and purpose of this provision is thus stated in State Indust. Comm. v. Newman, supra, page 366 (118 N. E. 795): 'In March, 1914, the present Workmen's Compensation Law was finally enacted. ... It did not then contain the provisions ... of subdivision 7 of section 15. In November, 1915, we decided that a claimant, who became an employee under the act, having theretofore lost a hand, became entitled, upon the loss of the remaining hand while such employee, to the compensation for permanent total disability and not to the lesser compensation for permanent partial disability. ... Manifestly, the law was a hinderance to those who, having lost a hand or other member, sought to become employees under the act, because the loss of the remaining member subjected the employer to the payment of a compensation \n substantially greater than it would in case the employee had had the two members. After the decision ... the legislature by an amendment to subdivision 6 [now 7] of section 15 enacted that 'an employee who is suffering from a previous disability shall not receive compensation for a later injury in excess of the compensation allowed for such injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with the previous disability.' ... The provisions of section 15 were supplemented in 1916 by the addition of subdivision 7. ... The evident and clear purpose of the subdivision was to remove a condition, as between employers and partially disabled employees, inconsonant with the spirit of the act and, perhaps, unjust, through the creation of a state fund contributed to by the insurance carriers and, as the permanent total disability arose, accessible to any member of the entire prescribed class of employees so disabled.' \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Laws of 1920, c. 760,  2, added to the Education Law (Consol. Laws, c. 16) as article 47, a 'Rehabilitation Law,' by which the State accepted the provisions of the Federal appropriation for vocational training of disabled persons, made an additional appropriation therefor to the state department of education, and required the industrial commission to report to that department all cases of injuries received by employees which might result in need of rehabilitation. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This provision, which was formerly subdivision 8 of section 15, was incorporated into the Compensation Law by the Laws of 1920, c 760,  1; the amount of the payment originally prescribed being $900. The constitutionality of this subdivision, in its original form, was sustained in Watkinson v. Hotel Pennsylvania, 231 N. Y. 562, 132 N. E. 889 ( affirming, without opinion, 195 App. Div. 624, 187 N. Y. Supp. 278). \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Note 2, supra. \n\n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRADICE v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK(1924)\nNo. 176\nArgued: Decided: March 10, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Henry W. Hill, of Buffalo, N. Y. (Mr. Dean R. Hill, of Buffalo, N. Y., of counsel), for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Walter F. Hofheims, of Buffalo, N. Y., and Irving I. Goldsmith, of Saratoga Springs, N. Y., for the People of the State of New York. \n\n[264 U.S. 292, 293]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error was convicted in the City Court of Buffalo upon the charge of having violated the provisions of a statute of the state of New York, prohibiting the employment of women in restaurants in cities of the first and second class, between the hours of 10 o'clock at night and 6 o'clock in the morning. Laws of New York, 1917, c. 535, p. 1564.1\n An appeal was prosecuted through intermediate appellate courts to the Court of Appeals, where the judgment was affirmed without an opinion. The record having been remitted to the City Court, the writ of error was allowed to that court. Aldrich v. AEtna Co., 8 Wall. 491, 495; Hodges v. Snyder, \n261 \nU.S. 600, 601\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 435.\n The validity of the statute is challenged upon the ground that it contravenes the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it violates (1) the due process clause, by depriving the employer and employee of their liberty of contract; and (2) the equal protection, clause, by an unreasonable and arbitrary classification.\n\n 1. \nThe basis of the first contention is that the statute unduly and arbitrarily interferes with the liberty of two \n\n[264 U.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n adult persons to make a contract of employment for themselves. The answer of the state is that night work of the kind prohibited so injuriously affects the physical condition of women, and so threatens to impair their peculiar and natural functions, and so exposes them to the dangers and menaces incident to night life in large cities, that a statute prohibiting such work falls within the police power of the state to preserve and promote the public health and welfare.\n The Legislature had before it a mass of information from which it concluded that night work is substantially and especially detrimental to the health of women. We cannot say that the conclusion is without warrant. The loss of restful night's sleep cannot be fully made up by sleep in the daytime, especially in busy cities, subject to the disturbances incident to modern life. The injurious consequences were thought by the Legislature to bear more heavily against women than men, and, considering their more delicate organism, there would seem to be good reason for so thinking. The fact, assuming it to be such, properly may be made the basis of legislation applicable only to women. Testimony was given upon the trial to the effect that the night work in question was not harmful; but we do not find it convincing. Where the constitutional validity of a statute depends upon the existence of facts, courts must be cautious about reaching a conclusion respecting them contrary to that reached by the Legislature; and if the question of what the facts establish be a fairly debatable one, it is not permissible for the judge to set up his opinion in respect of it against the opinion of the lawmaker. The state Legislature here determined that night employment of the character specified was sufficiently detrimental to the health and welfare of women engaging in it to justify its suppression, and, since we are unable to say that the finding is clearly unfounded, we are precluded from reviewing the legislative \n\n[264 U.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n determination. Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366, 395\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 383. The language used by this court in Muller v. Oregon, \n208 \nU.S. 412, 422\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 324, 327 (52 L. Ed. 551, 13 Ann. Cas. 957), in respect of the physical limitations of women, is applicable and controlling:\n'The limitations which this statute places upon her contractual powers, upon her right to agree with her employer as to the time she shall labor, are not imposed solely for her benefit, but also largely for the benefit of all. Many words cannot make this plainer. The two sexes differ in structure of body, in the functions to be performed by each, in the amount of physical strength, in the capacity for long- dontinued labor, particularly when done standing, the influence of vigorous health upon the future well-being of the race, the self- reliance which enables one to assert full rights, and in the capacity to maintain the struggle for subsistence. This difference justifies a difference in legislation and upholds that which is designed to compensate for some of the burdens which rest upon her.'\n\n Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 U.S. 525\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 394, 24 A. L. R. 1238, is cited and relied upon; but that case presented a question entirely different from that now being considered. The statute in the Adkins Case was a wage-fixing law, pure and simple. It had nothing to do with the hours or conditions of labor. We held that it exacted from the employer 'an arbitrary payment for a purpose and upon a basis having no causal connection with the business, or the contract or the work' of the employee; but, referring to the Muller Case we said (page 553) that 'the physical differences [between men and women] must be recognized in appropriate cases, and legislation fixing hours or conditions of work may properly take them into account.'

A. 1915C, 960. \n\n[264 U.S. 292, 296]\n\u00a0\n 2. Nor is the statute vulnerable to the objection that it constitutes a denial of the equal protection of the laws. The points urged under this head are (a) that the act discriminates between cities of the first and second class and other cities and communities; and (b) excludes from its operation women employed in restaurants as singers and performers, attendants in ladies' cloak rooms and parlors, as well as those employed in dining rooms and kitchens of hotels and in lunch rooms or restaurants conducted by employers solely for the benefit of their employees.\n The limitation of the legislative prohibition to cities of the first and second class does not bring about an unreasonable and arbitrary classification. Packard v. Banton, \n264 U.S. 140\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 257, 68 L. Ed. --, decided February 18, 1924; Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 U.S. 68\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 350. Nor is there substance in the contention that the exclusion of restaurant employees of a special kind, and of hotels and employees' lunchrooms, renders the statute obnoxious to the Constitution. The statute does not present a case where some persons of a class are selected for special restraint, from which others of the same class are left free (Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 \nU.S. 540, 564\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 431); but a case where all in the same class of work are included in the restraint. Of course, the mere fact of classification is not enough to put a statute beyond the reach of the equality provision of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such classification must not be 'purely arbitrary, oppressive or capricious.' American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89, 92\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 43. But the mere production of inequality is not enough. Every selection of persons for regulation so results, in some degree. The inequality produced, in order to encounter the challenge of the Constitution, must be 'actually and palpably unreasonable and arbitrary.' Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n261 \nU.S. 379, 384\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 387, and cases cited. Thus classifications have been sustained which are based upon differences between fire insurance and other kinds of insurance, Orient Insurance \n\n[264 U.S. 292, 297]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Daggs, \n172 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 281; between railroads and other corporations, Tullis v. Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co., \n175 \nU.S. 348, 351\n, 20 S. Sup.

Fears, \n179 \nU.S. 270, 275\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 128; between sugar refiners who produce the sugar and those who purchase it, American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, supra. More directly applicable are recent decisions of this court sustaining hours of labor for women in hotels, but omitting women employees of boarding houses, lodging houses, etc., Miller v. Wilson, supra, at page 382 (35 Sup. Ct. 342), and limiting the hours of labor of women pharmacists and student nurses in hospitals but excepting graduate nurses. Bosley v. McLaughlin, supra, at pages 394-396 (35 Sup. Ct. 345). The opinion in the first of these cases was delivered by Mr. Justice Hughes, who, after pointing out that in hotels women employees are for the most part chambermaids and waitresses, that it cannot be said that the conditions of work are the same as those which obtain in the other establishments, and that it is not beyond the power of the Legislature to recognize the differences, said (\n236 \nU.S. 383, 384\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 344 [59 L. Ed. 632]):\n'The contention as to the various omissions which are noted in the objections here urged ignores the well-established principle that the Legislature is not bound, in order to support the constitutional validity of its regulation, to extend it to all cases which it might possibly reach. Dealing with practical exigencies, the Legislature may be guided by experience. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 U.S. 138\n, 144. It is free to recognize degrees of harm, and it may confine its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is deemed to be clearest. As has been said, it may 'proceed cautiously, step by step,' and 'if an evil is \n\n[264 U.S. 292, 298]\n\u00a0\n specially experienced in a particular branch of business' if is not necessary that the prohibition 'should be couched in all-embracing terms.' Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance Co., \n199 U.S. 401\n, 411. If the law presumably hits the evil where it is most felt, it is not to be overthrown because there are other instances to which it might have been applied. Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 U.S. 224\n, 227. Upon this principle, which has had abundant illustration in the decisions cited below, it cannot be concluded that the failure to extend the act to other and distinct lines of business, having their own circumstances and conditions, or to domestic service, created an arbitrary discrimination as against the proprietors of hotels.'\n\n The judgment below is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '3. In cities of the first and second class no female over the age of sixteen years shall be employed, permitted or suffered to work in or in connection with any restaurant more than six days or fifty-four hours in any one week, or more than nine hours in any one day, or before six o'clock in the morning or after ten o'clock in the evening of any day. This subdivision shall, however, not apply to females employed in restaurants as singers and performers of any kind, or as attendants in ladies' cloak rooms and parlors, nor shall it apply to females employed in or in connection with the dining rooms and kitchens of hotels, or in or in connection with lunch rooms or restaurants conducted by employers solely for the benefit of their own employees.' \n\n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAILROAD COMMISSION OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA v.

C., for respondents. \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 338]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether the state Railroad Commission of California has power to require the Southern Pacific Company, the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, and the Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad Company to build an interstate union depot in the city of Los Angeles.\n The proceedings were begun in 1916 before the Railroad Commission by complaints of civic associations and others against the railway companies. Before the hearing and the decision were had, the Transportation Act of Congress of 1920 was enacted (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 a et seq.). In December, 1921, after two hearings, an amended order against the railways was made, by which they were required to remove certain grade crossings and to build a union terminal within a certain defined area in the city.\n The railway companies sought review of this order in the Supreme Court of the state, and their three writs were heard and disposed of as one case. The Supreme Court of the state held that the order was beyond the power of the state Railroad Commission, because the subject-matter was committed to the Interstate Commerce Cmmission by the Transportation Act of 1920. The court further held that, if the order had effected the elimination of grade crossings alone, it would have been valid, but that, associated as it was with the establishment of the union station, it must be annulled. We have brought the case of the Commission against each of the railways here by certiorari.\n Lines of the three railways approach Los Angeles from the north and come together in the city near the North Broadway viaduct, as it crosses the Los Angeles river. Thence the Salt Lake and Santa Fe lines follow the bed of the Los Angeles river, one on its east and the other on its west bank. The Salt Lake passenger station is at First \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 339]\n\u00a0\n street. Its main line from Pasadena and Glendale comes from the north, but its line from Salt Lake comes in from the south. From north to south in Los Angeles, its line hugs the east bank of the river for three miles. The Santa Fe station is opposite that of the Salt Lake Railway on the west bank. The Santa Fe hugs the west bank for three miles in the city. One of its lines leaves Los Angeles by the north for Chicago. Another leaves the city by the south, through Riverside, for Chicago. The Southern Pacific does not follow the river bed after passing under the Broadway viaduct, but extends in a southwesterly direction until it reaches the north end of Alameda street. From that point it runs south through the city at grade on that street. Its station is at Fifth street and lies southwesterly from the Salt Lake and Santa Fe stations and a quarter of a mile distant from them. The eastern main line of the Southern Pacific crosses the river at Alhambra avenue, joins the San Francisco main line, and reaches the station from there by the same tracks on Alameda street. The Southern Pacific occupies Alameda street on grade and longitudinally in both directions from its station for three miles. Its lines toward the south go to San Pedro and Santa Ana.\n The order of the Railroad Commission requires the abandonment of the passenger stations of the three railways. The Southern Pacific station is a comparatively modern depot and would be adequate for many years. Those of the other two companies are not adequate, but they have ample ground upon which to construct suitable stations. The order required the removal from Alameda street of the main line of the Southern Pacific for three miles, permitting the use of its tracks in that street for switching during a few hours at night. The order also required that, by viaducts over the river and over the Salt Lake and Santa Fe tracks on the river banks, grade crossings should be eliminated. The order further required \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 340]\n\u00a0\n that the three railways should purchase jointly land enough in an area reaching from Alameda street to the river and from Aliso street to Alhambra street to erect a suitable union station, to be situated somewhere near a square called the Plaza. The railways are directed to make such additions to, extensions of, improvements and changes in, the existing railroad facilities of said companies as may be reasonably necessary and incidental to the use of said union passenger station. This would require the removal of the present station of the Southern Pacific from Fifth street toward the Plaza, at least half a mile, and the stations of the Santa Fe and the Salt Lake from First street on the river to the Plaza, more than a quarter of a mile. The changes to be effected under the order will require, in the abandonment of the Southern Pacific main track on Alameda street for three miles, a joint use by the Southern Pacific of main tracks on the river bank with either the Salt Lake or the Santa Fe, or the construction of its own main tracks on one side or the other along the river bank. The main tracks of the Salt Lake must be extended across the Los Angeles river on a viaduct to the area selected for the union station. The main track of the Santa Fe runs along the river side of the selected area, but an extension of its main tracks will have to be made to bring it into the new station.\n The order requires the joint use of land, tracks, and terminal facilities valued at $28,050,691, the abandonment of three existing passenger stations of the railways as such, and the ultimate capital expenditure for all recommendations of from $25,000,000 to $45,000,000.\n The Railroad Commission, in the Supreme Court of the state pressed the argument that, in view of its finding that the union station was an indispensable element in getting rid of the grade crossings, it had the incidental right to order its building. The court rejected the argument. It said: \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 341]\n\u00a0\n 'That notwithstanding the views expressed by the Railroad Commission in its findings and conclusions in the proceeding herein presented for review, we can perceive no indispensable relation between the elimination of grade crossings and the establishment of union depot facilities, nor can we see an unsurmountable difficulty why jurisdiction over the matter of eliminating grade crossings may not be exercised in a proper case consistently, and it may be concurrently, with the exercise of the authority which is vested by the act of Congress of 1920 in the Interstate Commerce Commission over the subject of union terminal depot facilities.'\n The state Supreme Court thus modifies the findings of the Railroad Commission, in so far as they sought to tie the validity of its order establishing a union station to its unquestioned police power to regulate grade crossings in the interest of the public safety. We avoid any inquiry how far, if at all, the principle laid down in Erie R. Co. v. Board of Public Utility, \n254 U.S. 394\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 169, is qualified by the provisions of the Transportation Act. Our only question here is whether the power to direct a new union station with its essential incidents is committed exclusively to the Interstate Commerce Commission under the act of 1920\n\n\n In Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. Co. v. United States et al. (decided January 7, 1924) \n263 U.S. 456\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 169, 68 L. Ed. --, this court said of the Transportation Act:\n'The new act seeks affirmatively to build up a system of railways prepared to handle promptly all the interstate traffic of the country. It aims to give the owners of the railways an opportunity to earn enough to maintain their properties and equipment in such a state of efficiency that they can carry well this burden. To achieve this great purpose, it puts the railroad systems of the country more completely than ever under the fostering guardianship and control of the [Interstate Commerce] Commission which is to supervise their issue of \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 342]\n\u00a0\n securities, their car supply and distribution, their joint use of terminals, their construction of new lines, their abandonment of old lines, and by a proper division of joint rates, and by fixing adequate rates for interstate commerce, and in case of discrimination, for intrastate commerce, to secure a fair return upon the properties of the carriers engaged.' New England land Divisions Case, \n261 U.S. 184\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 270; Railroad Commission v. C., B. & Q. Ry., \n257 U.S. 563\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086.\n\n On the one hand, it is urged that, with the purposes thus declared, the act commits to the supervision and control of the Interstate Commerce Commission such an undertaking as is here in question, involving a new capital investment of from $25,000,000 to $45,000,000 in the terminals of three great interstate railway systems in the largest city of our western coast. On the other hand, it is earnestly contended that, since no specific provision is made for the supervision of interstate union stations by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the whole subject remains in the control of the state Railroad Commissions. We must examine the sections of the act in some detail to determine the force of these counter contentions.\n The term 'railroad' is defined in the act (paragraph 3,  1, as amended by section 400, Transportation Act [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563]) to include all switches, spurs, tracks, terminals and terminal facilities of every kind used or necessary in the transportation of persons or property including freight depots, yards and grounds used therein. Section 402, after defining the term 'car service' under the act, as including use, control, distribution, and exchange of locomotives, cars and other vehicles used in interstate transportation, provides for just regulation of it by the Commission, and gives that body power in case of shortage of equipment or other emergency, to suspend the regulations, to give just directions, without regard to ownership, to promote the service and to adjust proper compensation \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 343]\n\u00a0\n for its use, and 'to require such joint or common use of terminals including main track or tracks for a reasonable distance outside of such terminals, as in the opinion of the Commission will meet the emergency and the public interest and upon hearing determine just compensation for use of same. Paragraph 16 authorizes the Commission to provide transportation by other carriers if one carrier is unable to handle its traffic upon terms fixed by the Commission.\n By section 405, amended section 3 of the Interstate Commerce Act ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8565) provides in its third paragraph that all carriers shall afford all reasonable facilities for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines and for forwarding and delivering passengers. Paragraph 4 provides that the Commission may, in the public interest and without impairment of a carrier's power to handle its own business with its terminal facilities, require the use of its terminal facilities, including its main line track or tracks for a reasonable distance outside of its terminal for another carrier or carriers, upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the parties, fixed by the Commission or determined by suit as in condemnation proceedings.\n It is obvious from the foregoing that Congress intended to place under the superintending and fostering direction of the Interstate Commerce Commission all increased facilities in the matter of distribution of cars and equipment and in joint terminals, in the exchange of interstate traffic and passengers between railways so as to make it prompt and continuous. It not only provides for the temporary expropriation of terminals and main track of one railway to the common use of one or more other railways in an emergency, but it also contemplates the compulsory sharing of one company's terminals with one or more companies as a permanent arrangement. This is a drastic limitation of a carrier's control and use of its own property, in order to secure convenience and dispatch \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 344]\n\u00a0\n for the whole shipping and traveling public in interstate commerce. It gives to the Interstate Commerce Commission the power and duty, where the public interest requires, to make out of what is the passenger and freight station of one interstate carrier a union station or depot.\n But it is insisted that the supervisory power thus conferred does not include the installation of an interstate union station, where its terminals and main tracks are newly built, and the interstate carriers are compelled to expropriate, not the terminal property of another interstate carrier, but property of others than carriers not theretofore used for terminals. This would be giving power to the Interstate Commerce Commission to provide for a small and contracted union station of interstate carriers, limited to the terminals of one carrier, and would leave the larger and more important union stations of interstate carriers to the control of state commissions. We think, however, that means of control over installation of such new union stations for interstate carriers is given to the Interstate Commerce Commission in amended paragraphs (18 to 21) of section 402. They provide that no interstate carrier shall undertake the extension of its line of railroad or the construction of a new line of railroad, or shall acquire or operate any line of railroad, or extension thereof, or shall engage in transportation over such additional or extended line of railroad unless and until the Commission shall certify that public convenience present or future requires it, and that no carrier shall abandon all or any portion of its line or the operation of it without a similar certificate of approval. Such a certificate is, we think, necessary in the construction of a new interstate union station, which involves a substantial and expensive extension of the main tracks or lines of interstate carriers who theretofore have maintained separate terminals.\n It is argued that paragraphs 18 to 21 of section 402 refer only to extensions of a line of railroad having the \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 345]\n\u00a0\n purpose to include new territory to be served by the interstate carrier and do not refer to an extension of new main track for the mere purpose of rearranging terminals within the same city. We do not think the language of paragraphs 18 to 21 can be properly so limited. We are confirmed in this by paragraph No. 22, which immediately follows:\n'The authority of the Commission conferred by paragraphs 18 to 21, both inclusive, shall not extend to the construction or abandonment of spur, industrial, team, switching or side tracks, located or to be located wholly within one state, or of street, suburban, or interurban electric railways, which are not operated as a part or parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation.'\n\n This is a palpable distinction between the main tracks of an interstate carrier, and its spur, industrial, switching or side tracks, and shows the legislative intention to retain any substantial change in the main tracks within the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It may well be that a mere relocation of a main track of an interstate carrier which does not involve a real addition to, or abandonment of, main tracks and terminals, or a substantial change in destination, does not come within the paragraphs 18 to 21. One might, too, readily conceive of railroad crossings, or connections of interstate carriers in which the exercise by a state commission of the power to direct the construction of merely local union stations or terminals without extensions of main tracks and substantial capital outlay should be regarded as an ordinary exercise of the police power of the state for the public convenience and would not trench upon the power and supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in securing proper regulation of an interchange of interstate traffic or passengers. Only a lawful order of the Interstate Commerce Commission would raise a question of the power of \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 346]\n\u00a0\n a state commission the such cases, as the proviso of paragraph 17, section 402, of the Transportation Act shows:\n'That nothing in this act shall impair or affect the right of a state, in the exercise of its police power, to require just and reasonable freight and passenger service for intrastate business, except in so far as such requirement is inconsistent with any lawful order of the Commission made under the provisions of this act.'\n\n But there is a great difference between such relocation of tracks or local union stations and what is proposed here. The differences are more than that of mere degree, they and their consequences are so marked as to constitute a change in kind. They come within paragraphs 18 to 21 of section 402 and require a certiflcate of the Interstate Commerce Commission as a condition precedent to the validity of any action by the carriers or of any order by the state commission.\n The proviso of paragraph 21 of section 402 is significant of the distinction we are pointing out. It forbids the Commission to authorize or order the extension of its lines 'unless the Commission finds, as to such extension, that it is reasonably required in the interest of public convenience and necessity, or as to such extension ... that the expense involved therein will not impair the ability of the carrier to perform its duty to the public.'\n The extensions of the lines and main tracks of these railways under the plan which the state commission has ordered are not great in distance, but they involve a new intramural destination for each railway with important changes in the handling of interstate traffic and passengers. Great expense attends such changes of the main tracks in a crowded city, and they here carry with them as necessarily incident thereto, the abandonment of available sites and of valuable existing passenger and freight stations and the construction of a new union station elsewhere, imposing on the three railways a cost in making \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 347]\n\u00a0\n the changes of from $25,000,000 to $45,000,000. We think it clear that in such an extension of main lines with their terminals the Interstate Commerce Commission is required by the act to make a finding that the expense involved will not impair the ability of the carriers concerned to perform their duty to the public.\n The purpose of Congress to prevent interstate carriers from incurring expense which will lessen their ability to perform well their interstate functions is further shown in section 439 of the Transportation Act Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8592a) whereby the Interstate Commerce Act is amended by insertion of section 20a. This new section subjects to the approval or rejection of the Interstate Commerce Commission the issue by an interstate carrier of all future shares of stock, bonds, or other evidence of indebtedness, and forbids approval unless the Commission shall find that their issue is for a lawful purpose, is compatible with the public interest, is appropriate and necessary to the discharge of its public duty as a common carrier and will not impair its ability to perform that service. This is of course in parimateria with the restriction of paragraph 21 of section 402 to prevent a possible impairment of the financial ability of interstate carriers to discharge their interstate commerce duties. Such a heavy burden as that involved in this new union station and the main track changes and extensions and other accessories would in all probability require the three railways to issue new capital securities, and this could not be done without the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. To be sure this provision only becomes operative when securities have to be issued, and would not, of itself, prevent action by a state commission until such securities are seen to be necessary; but the provision indicates the general congressional plan.\n We were advised by statements at the bar that, after the California Supreme Court handed down its decision in this case, the city of Los Angeles filed a petition with \n\n[264 U.S. 331, 348]\n\u00a0\n the Interstate Commerce Commission, asking for an order to provide, maintain, and use a union station, that a hearing followed, and that, pending the decision in this court, the matter is held under consideration.\n For the reasons given, we think the course taken by the city of Los Angeles was the correct one. Until the Interstate Commerce Commission shall have acted under paragraphs 18 to 21 of section 402 of the Transportation Act. the respondent railways cannot be required to provide a new interstate union station and to extend their main tracks thereto as ordered by the state Railroad Commission.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAILROAD COMMISSION OF STATE OF TEXAS v. EASTERN TEXAS R. CO.(1924)\nNo. 145\nArgued: March 8, 1923Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 79, 80]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. A. Keeling, of Mexia, Tex., and T. W. Gregory, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 79, 82]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John R. Turney and Daniel Upthegrove, both of St. Louis, Mo., and E. B. Perkins, of Dallas, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two suits involve the right of the Eastern Texas Railroad Company, a Texas corporation having a railroad in that state, to dismantle and abandon its road. One was brought by the company to prevent threatened interference by the state's officers; the other by the state to prevent intended dismantling and abandonment by the company. The former was begun in the District Court; the latter was removed into that court from a state court. The company prevailed (283 Fed. 584), and the state and its officers prosecute these direct appeals. \n\n[264 U.S. 79, 83]\n\u00a0\n The road is 30.3 miles long and all in Texas. The company constructed it in 1902, operated it continuously until April 30, 1921, and then discontinued its operation because it had proved a losing venture. The traffic over it during the period of operation was in greater part interstate and foreign commerce and in lesser part intrastate commerce. The withdrawal from interstate and foreign commerce had the sanction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, given under a law of Congress, and was sustained by this court in Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R. Co., \n258 U.S. 204\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 281. The present controversy relates to the withdrawal from intrastate commence and the intended dismantling and abandonment of the road.\n The road was constructed primarily to carry traffic to and from large lumbering industries in that territory; but in the course of time those industries exhausted the adjacent supply of timber, and in 1917 they were permanently closed and the people who had been employed in them moved away. The traffic over the road then fell off so much that the revenue became pronouncedly less than the cost of operation. But the operation was continued until the company had exhausted its surplus accumulated in prior years, had come to be without cash or credit, and was unable to go on. Its only remaining property consisted of the road and some meager equipment; and these had shrunken in value from $450,000 to $50,000-the latter being the estimated salvage value less the cost of dismantling. The property was offered for sale at $50,000 to any one who would operate the road, and the offer was widely advertised, but without eliciting any acceptance or bid. Essential repairs would cost $185,000. The operating cost would be as much as $84,000 per year; the possible revenue from all traffic would not exceed $50,000, and that from intrastate traffic would not be more than $ 20,000. The adjacent country was sparsely populated; the soil had proved to be usually unproductive; there were \n\n[264 U.S. 79, 84]\n\u00a0\n no local industries, and the general situation precluded any reasonable expectation that the road would become self-sustaining in the future. In these circumstances the company concluded to cease all operation and to dismantle and abandon the road.\n The company was incorporated under a general law of the state in 1900 for a term of 25 years, and when it ceased operating the road 4 1\/2 years of that term remained. It had not received any state land grant or other public aid; nor had it acquired any property through an exercise of the power of eminent domain, although that power was available under the law of the state.\n In the District Court, the state and its officers took the position that under the state statutes the company was prohibited from dismantling or abandoning its road, and was in duty bound, and could be compelled, to operate the same in intrastate commerce for the remainder of the 25-year term. In this court they have adhered to that position, with the qualification that, in the circumstances shown, the company may not be compelled to operate the road, but may be made to respond in damages to the state for a failure to operate it. The company, on the other hand, has contended throughout that the state statutes neither prohibit the dismantling and abandonment of the road nor lay on the company a duty to operate it when that can be done only at a loss, and that, if the statutes be as insisted on the other side, they deprive the company of property without due process of law and in that respect are in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n The appellants rely on two statutory provisions, which they insist were in force when the company was incorporated and became a part of the charter contract. Before examining these provisions, it is well to advert to principles which would govern in their absence, and also to considerations bearing on their office and effect. \n\n[264 U.S. 79, 85]\n\u00a0\n The usual permissive charter of a railroad company does not give rise to any obligation on the part of the company to operate its road at a loss. No contract that it will do so can be elicited from the acceptance of the charter or from putting the road in operation. The company, although devoting its property to the use of the public, does not do so irrevocably or absolutely, but on condition that the public shall supply sufficient traffic on a resonable rate basis to yield a fair return. And if at any time it develops with reasonable certainty that future operation must be at a loss, the company may discontinue operation and get what it can out of the property by dismantling the road. To compel it to go on at a loss or to give up the salvage value would be to take its property without the just compensation which is a part of due process of law. The controlling principle is the same that is applied in the many cases in which the constitutionality of a rate is held to depend upon whether it yields a fair return. Brooks-Scanlon Co. v.

A. 564.\n So long as the railroad company 'continues to exercise' the privileges conferred by its charter, the state has power to regulate its operations in the interest of the public, and to that end may require it to provide reasonably safe and adequate facilities for serving the public, even though compliance be attended by some pecuniary disadvantage. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. North Carolina Railroad Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 1, 26\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 585, 11 Ann. Cas. 398; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 262, 279\n, 30 S.

But this rule in no wise militates against the principle that the company may withdraw its property from use by the public 'when that use can be kept up only at a loss.' Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission of Louisiana, supra.\n A state often has many laws relating to railroads on its statute books which do not become a part of the charter contract-which are of such a nature that it is apparent the state could not have intended to make or exact a continuing and binding stipulation embodying their terms. Among such laws are those containing specific regulations respecting the safety of employees and travelers, liability for injuries, facilities for handling and moving traffic and redress for failure to provide the facilities prescribed. The occasion for keeping such matters where the Legislature may deal with them as changing conditions may require forbids that they be regarded as part of the charter contract unless a purpose to make them such be plainly disclosed. In short, the fact that a particular provision is found in the statutes of the state relating to railroads, or even in a special act incorporating a railroad company, does not in itself suffice to show that the provision is a part of the charter contract.

Davis, Director General of Railroads, v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22, 24\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 13, 14 (68 L. Ed. --).\n By way of distinguishing the cases in hand from some which are cited by the appellants it is enough to observe that here the company has ceased to exercise the privilege, conferred by its charter, of maintaining and operating the road as a common carrier, and this because the available traffic has diminished to a point where further operation is economically impossible.\n One of the statutory provisions relied on is found in article 6676 of the Revised Civil Statutes of 1911, and requires that on all railroads 'carrying passengers for hire' there shall be at least one passenger train a day, Sundays excepted; that these trains shall stop at stations a sufficient time to discharge and receive passengers; and that, 'if so many are run,' four of these trains going each way shall stop daily, Sundays excepted, at county seats. This is nothing more than a regulation of passenger service on roads which are in operation and engaged in that service. It does not purport to impose an unconditional duty to operate, or to carry passengers, but requires that where and while a passenger service is maintained it shall conform to the standards stated. Such a provision falls far short of subjecting a railroad company, through charter contract or otherwise, to an absolute duty to operate its road for the full charter period, even after it becomes reasonably that the operation will be at a pronounced loss.\n The other provision on which the appellants rely was enacted as part of an Act of March 29, 1889, c. 24, and was re-enacted as article 4550 of the Revised Civil \n\n[264 U.S. 79, 88]\n\u00a0\n Statutes of 1895, and as article 6625 of the like Statutes of 1911. The original enactment is described in its caption as relating 'to rights of purchasers of roadbeds, etc., sold for debt,' and in the captions of both re-enactments as relating to 'new corporations in case of sale.' It provides that the purchasers of any railroad sold under judicial decree, etc., and their associates shall be entitled to form a corporation to take over, maintain and operate the road with power to 'construct and extend.' This is followed by provisos of a restrictive nature, the last of which reads:\n'Provided, that by such purchase and organization no rights shall be acquired under any former charter or law in conflict with the provisions of the present constitution in any respect, nor shall the main track of any railroad once constructed and operated be abandoned or removed.'\n\n A second section provides that any corporation so formed which shall 'claim to be under the jurisdiction of the federal courts' shall thereby forfeit its organization, etc., and a third section declares the existence of an emergency requiring that the act take effect immediately on its passage, because of the absence of any sufficient law providing for the formation of a corporation 'for the purpose of acquiring, owning, and extending such sold out property.' A reading of the enactment, including its caption and emergency section, shows that every part of it relates to the organization, rights and duties of corporations formed to take over, maintain and operate railroads sold under judicial decree, etc., unless the concluding part of the proviso just quoted is to be taken as having a broader scope. The appellants contend that it should be so taken. Read by itself it gives strong support to the contention. But can it be rightly separated from the context and read alone? Does it when so read reflect the legislative intent? In our opinion the answers must be in the negative. The provision evidently is intended to have the \n\n[264 U.S. 79, 89]\n\u00a0\n same scope as the other parts of the act, and to be limited to the same railroads that they are. The captions used to describe the subject of the enactment give some support for this view, and the terms of the emergency section give it further support, for they make it fairly certain that only railroads sold for debt were in mind. The fact that the provision is included in a proviso strongly suggests that it is intended to qualify or restrict what precedes it rather than to reach into a larger field, and the suggestion is emphasized by the first part of the proviso, 'that by such purchase and organization no rights shall be,' etc. A single word, supplied by fair implication, will bring the provision into full accord with all that is in the proviso, and with all other parts of the act. With that word included, the provision will read 'nor shall the main track of any [such] railroad once constructed and operated be abandoned or removed.' To us it appears very plain that this is what is intended.\n There was no decision on the question in the courts of the state when the company was incorporated or when it made its investment in the road. Two decisions made several years later have a bearing but seem to leave the matter more or less open even in those tribunals. One by the Supreme Court, given in 1917, treats the provision as applicable to all railroads. But the question was not discussed, possibly because the road there involved had been sold under a judicial decree. State v. Enid, Ochiltree & Western Ry. Co., 108 Tex. 239, 191 S. W. 560. The other by the Court of Civil Appeals at Galveston, given in 1922, appears to treat the provision as applicable only to railroads sold for debt. Wexler v. State, 241 S. W. 231.\n As already indicated, we are of opinion that the provision, like other portions of the enactment of which it is a part, applies only to railroads sold under judicial decree, etc. This road never was so sold. The company did not acquire it through such a sale, but constructed it as an original undertaking. \n\n[264 U.S. 79, 90]\n\u00a0\n Our conclusion is that the appellants' reliance on the two statutes is not well grounded. They are all that are claimed to make the company's charter other than one of the usual permissive type. It follows that the District Court rightly held the company was entitled to withdraw the road from intrastate commerce and to dismantle and abandon it.\n Decrees affirmed. \n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRED CROSS LINE v.

Crandall, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[264 U.S. 109, 118]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Arbitration Law of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 72), enacted April 19, 1920 (Laws 1920, c. 275), and amended March 1, 1921 (Laws 1921, c. 14), declares that a provision in a written contract to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising between the parties 'shall be valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.' Section 1. It authorizes the Supreme Court, or a judge thereof, to direct, upon the application of a party to such an agreement, that the arbitration proceed in the manner so provided; to appoint an arbitrator for the other party, in case he fails to avail himself of the method prescribed by the contract; and to stay trial of the action, if suit has been begun. The law applies to contracts made before its enactment, if the controversy arose thereafter. Matter of Berkovitz v. Arbib & Houlberg, 230 N. Y. 261, 270, 271, 130 N. E. 288. Prior to this statute an agreement to arbitrate was legal in New York and damages were recoverable for a breach thereof. Haggart v. Morgan, 5 N. Y. 422, 427, 55 Am. Dec. 350. But specific performance of the promise would not be enforced, the promise could not be pleaded in bar of an action, and it would not support a motion to stay. Finucane Co. v. Board of Education 190 N. Y. 76, 83, 82 N. E. 737. These limitations upon the enforcement of a promise to arbitrate had been held to be part of the law of remedies. Meacham v. James \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 119]\n\u00a0\n town, etc., R. R. Co., 211 N. Y. 346, 352, 105 N. E. 653, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 851. The purpose of the statute was to make specific performance compellable. 230 N. Y. 261, 269, 130 N. E. 288. Whether agreements for arbitration of disputes arising under maritime contracts are within the scope of the statute, and whether, if so construed and applied, the state law conflicts with the federal Constitution, are the questions for decision.\n Proceeding under the Arbitration Law, the Red Cross Line applied to the Supreme Court of the state, on April 12, 1921, for an order directing the Atlantic Fruit Company to join with it in the arbitration of a dispute arising out of the charter of the steamship Runa. The substantive claim was that the master had not prosecuted the voyage with the utmost dispatch, and hence that certain amounts paid by the charterer should be returned. The charter party, which had been executed in New York on November 28, 1919, contained the following provision:\n'That should any dispute arise between owners and charterers the matters in dispute shall be referred to three persons in New York, one to be appointed by each of the parties hereto, and the third by the two so chosen; their decision, or that of any two of them, shall be final and for the purpose of enforcing any award, this agreement may be made a rule of court. ...'\n\n Before instituting this proceeding the Red Cross Line had duly appointed its arbitrator; but the Atlantic Fruit Company had refused to appoint the one to be named by it. The court ordered the latter company to proceed to arbitration as provided in the contract, and to appoint its arbitrator by a day fixed. This order was affirmed by the Appellate Division without opinion. Its judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which stated that the controversy between the parties is one of admiralty; that under article 3,  2, of the federal Constitution, and section 256, cl. 3, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1233), \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 120]\n\u00a0\n such controversies are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the admiralty courts; and that the state had no power to compel the charter owner to proceed to arbitration. Matter of Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 233 N. Y. 373, 135 N. E. 821. The case is here on writ of certiorari under section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended (Comp. St.  1214); \n260 U.S. 716\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 95.\n Respondent contends that the petition should be dismissed for lack of a federal question. The argument is that the Court of Appeals held, as a matter of statutory construction, that the Arbitration Law does not extend to controversies which are within the admiralty jurisdiction, and that the substantive claim sought to be enforced is so cognizable. The claim to recover an amount paid under a charter party as charter hire is within the admiralty jurisdiction. Morewood v. Enequist, 23 How. 491. If that court had construed the Arbitration Law as excluding from its scope controversies which are within the admiralty jurisdiction, the construction given to the state statute would bind us, and there would be no occasion to consider the constitutional question presented. Quong Ham Wah Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n255 U.S. 445\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 373; Ward & Gow v. Krinsky, \n259 \nU.S. 503, 510\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 529. An expression used by the Court of Appeals lends some color to respondent's contention. 233 N. Y. 373, 381, 135 N. E. 821. But a reading of the whole opinion shows that the state court excluded maritime contracts from the operation of the law, not as a matter of statutory construction, but because it thought the federal Constitution required such action. Compare State Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Corporation, \n259 U.S. 263\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 473, 25 A. L. R. 1013. We proceed, therefore, to the consideration of the constitutional question.\n The federal courts-like those of the states and of England-have, both in equity and at law, denied, in large measure, the aid of their processes to those seeking to en force \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 121]\n\u00a0\n executory agreements to arbitrate disputes. They have declined to compel specific performance, Tobey v. County of Bristol, 3 Story, 800, 819-826, Fed. Cas. No. 14,065;1 or to stay proceedings on the original cause of action. Story, Equity Jurisprudence,  670. They have not given effect to the executory agreement as a plea in bar, except in those cases where the agreement, leaving the general question of liability to judicial decision, confines the arbitration to determining the amount payable or to furnishing essential evidence of specific facts, and makes it a condition precedent to the cause of action. Hamilton v. Liverpool, London & Globe Insurance Co., \n136 \nU.S. 242, 255\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 945; Martinsburg & Potomac R. R. Co. v. March, \n114 U.S. 549\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1035. But an agreement for arbitration is valid, even if it provides for the determination of liability. If executory, a breach will support an action for damages. Hamilton v. Home Insurance Co., \n137 U.S. 370\n, 385-386, 11 Sup. Ct. 133. If executed-that is, if the award has been made-effect will be given to the award in any appropriate proceeding at law, or in equity. Karthaus v. Ferrer, 1 Pet. 222; Burchell v. Marsh, 17 How. 344; Bayne v. Morris, 1 Wall. 97. And, although there is no federal legislation on the subject, an executory agreement, however comprehensive, will, if made a rule of court, be \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 122]\n\u00a0\n enforced in courts of the United States by any appropriate process. Heckers v. Fowler, 2 Wall. 123.2\n In admiralty, also, agreements to submit controversies to arbitration are valid. Reference of maritime controversies to arbitration has long been common practice. \n3\n Houseman v. Schooner North Carolina, 15 Pet. 40, 45. The insertion in a charter party of a provision for such settlement of disputes arising thereunder was practiced, at least, as early as the eighteenth century. Thompson v. Charnock, 2 Durnford & East, 139. For breach of an executory agreement a libel for damages will lie. \n4\n An executory agreement may be made a rule of court. United States v. Farragut, 22 Wall. 406, 419; Kleine v. Catara, 2 Gall, 61, Fed. Cas. No. 7,869. \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 123]\n\u00a0\n AN AWARD WILL BE GIVEN FULL EFFECT. \n5\n the agreement whether executory or executed, cannot be enforced in admiralty by specific performance; merely because that court lacks the power to grant equitable relief. The Eclipse, \n135 \nU.S. 599, 608\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 873.6 The executory agreement (perhaps in deference to the rule prevailing at law and in equity) will not be given effect as a bar to a libel on the original cause of action. The reluctance of the admiralty court to lend full aid goes, however, merely to the remedy. The substantive right created by an agreement to submit it disputes to arbitration is recognized as a perfect obligation. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n By reason of the saving clause, state courts have jurisdiction in personam, concurrent with the admiralty courts, of all causes of action maritime in their nature arising under charter parties. Judiciary Act Sept. 24, 1789, c. 20,  9, 1 Stat. 73, 77; Judicial Code,  24, par. 3 (Comp. St.  991); Leon v. Galceran, 11 Wall. 185; Schoonmaker v. Gilmore, \n102 U.S. 118\n; Chappell v. Bradshaw, \n128 U.S. 132\n; 9 Sup. Ct. 40; De Lovio v. Boit, 2 Gall. 398, 475, Fed. Cas. No. 3,776. The 'right of a common-law remedy,' so saved to suitors, does not, as has been held in cases which presently will be mentioned, include \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 124]\n\u00a0\n attempted changes by the states in the substantive admiralty law, but it does include all means other than proceedings in admiralty which may be employed to enforce the right or to redress the injury involved. It includes remedies in pais, as well as proceedings in court; judicial remedies conferred by statute, as well as those existing at the common law; remedies in equity, as well as those enforceable in a court of law. Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey, \n177 U.S. 638\n, 644, et seq., 20 Sup. Ct. 824; Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry & Machine Co., \n237 U.S. 303\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 596. A state may not provide a remedy in rem for any cause of action within the admiralty jurisdiction. The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555; The Glide, \n167 U.S. 606\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 930. But otherwise the state, having concurrent jurisdiction, is free to adopt such remedies, and to attach to them such incidents, as it sees fit. New York, therefore, had the power to confer upon its courts the authority to compel parties within its jurisdiction to specifically perform an agreement for arbitration which is valid by the general maritime law, as well as by the law of the state, which is contained in a contract made in New York and which, by its terms, is to be performed there.\n This state statute is wholly unlike those which have recently been held invalid by this court. The Arbitration Law deals merely with the remedy in the state courts in respect of obligations voluntarily and lawfully incurred. It does not attempt either to modify the substantive maritime law or to deal with the remedy in courts of admiralty. The Workmen's Compensation Laws involved in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, Clyde Steamship Co. v. Walker, \n244 U.S. 255\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 545, Peters v. Veasey, \n251 U.S. 121\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 65, and Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 U.S. 149\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 438, 11A. L. R. 1145, were declared invalid, because their provisions were held to modify or displace essential features of the substantive maritime law. In Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, \n248 U.S. 308\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 112, the state statute did not deal with the substantive maritime law. It was held invalid, because, as construed \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 125]\n\u00a0\n and applied, it attempted to modify the remedial law of the admiralty courts. The state statutes involved in all the other cases were declared valid. Those giving the substantive right to recover for negligence resulting in death were upheld, because they merely supplemented the substantive maritime law and did not conflict with any essential feature of it. Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 U.S. 233\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 89; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, \n261 U.S. 479\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 418. See, also, Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522; Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 U.S. 99\n, 104; The Hamilton, \n207 U.S. 398\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 133. La Bourgogne, \n210 \nU.S. 95, 138\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 664. The Workmen's Compensation Laws involved in other cases were upheld, because their provisions, as applied, were found not to be in conflict with any essential feature of the general maritime law. Grant Smith-Porter Co. v. Rohde, \n257 U.S. 469\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008; Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Co., \n259 U.S. 263\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 473, 25 A. L. R. 1013. No state statute was involved in Chelentis v. Luckenbach, \n247 U.S. 372\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 501. The court held there that under the general maritime law the seaman had no substantive right to recover; that this rule of substantive maritime law applied whether he sued in the state courts or in the court of admiralty; and that the Seaman's Act of 1915 (38 Stat. 1164) did not change this rule of substantive law. In no case has this court held void a state statute which neither modified the substantive maritime law, nor dealt with the remedies enforceable in admiralty.\n As the constitutionality of the remedy provided by New York for use in its own courts is not dependent upon the practice or procedure which may prevail in admiralty, we have no occasion to consider whether the unwillingness of the federal courts to give full effect to executory agreements for arbitration can be justified. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Reversed. \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 126]\n\u00a0\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n This controversy arose out of a charter party dated November 28, 1919, a maritime contract, which contains a clause providing for the settlement of disputes by arbitration. 233 N. Y. 373, 135 N. E. 821.\n Parties to such agreements contract with reference to the maritime law; consequent rights and liabilities depend upon its rules and are the same in all courts, admiralty or state. This general doctrine, definitely stated in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, has been reaffirmed and applied again and again. Clyde S. S. Co. v. Walker, \n244 U.S. 255\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 545; Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., \n247 U.S. 372\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 501; Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, 248 U. 308, 39 Sup. Ct. 112; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 U.S. 149\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145; Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 U.S. 233\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 89; Grant Smith-Porter Co. v. Rohde, \n257 U.S. 469\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, \n259 U.S. 255\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 475; Industrial Comm. v. Nordenholt Co., \n259 U.S. 263\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 473, 25 A. L. R. 1013; Osaka Shosen Kaisha v. Lumber Co., \n260 U.S. 490\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 172; Great Lakes Co. v. Kierejewski, \n261 U.S. 479\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 418.\n No admiralty court would enforce the arbitration clause of the charter party before us; their accepted policy forbids. Accordingly it was not obligatory upon the parties. The law of the sea became part of their agreement.\n But it is said under the local law a state court may enforce arbitration and thus effectuate the provision, although unenforceable in admiralty, since the statute relates to the remedy and not to substantive rights. In Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, an admiralty cause, we refused to give effect to the state statute of frauds, holding that the parties had contracted with reference to maritime law, not the local enactment. Here, also, the effort is to modify an agreement made with reference to the general rules of maritime law by applying the local law. Certainly this could not be done in an admiralty court; \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 127]\n\u00a0\n no more should it be possible under state practice. If Union Fish Co. v. Erickson had been before a state tribunal the applicable rule would have been the same and would have required enforcement of the contract notwithstanding the local statute. Obligations under maritime contracts do not vary with the tribunal.\n Fifty years ago this court pointed out the essential relationship between rights and remedies. Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 552. 'Nothing can be more material to the obligation than the means of enforcement. Without the remedy the contract may, indeed, in the sense of the law, be said not to exist, and its obligation to fall within the class of those moral and social duties which depend for their fulfilment wholly upon the will of the individual. The ideas of validity and remedy are inseparable, and both are parts of the obligation, which is guaranteed by the Constitution against invasion. The obligation of a contract 'is the law which binds the parties to perform their agreement.\"\n Under the guise of providing remedies no state state statute may add to or take from the obligations imposed by the contract within the admiralty jurisdiction. The doctrine concerning the general maritime law announced here over and over again forbids. If state courts can enforce provisions for compulsory arbitration contrary to the policy of the admiralty courts, what will become of the uniformity of maritime rules which the Constitution undertook to establish?\n Judicial Code,  256 (Comp. St.  1233), endows the District Court with exclusive jurisdiction 'of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.' The remedy saved must relate to some right or liability given or imposed by maritime law- certainly not one which that law does \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 128]\n\u00a0\n not recognize. Furthermore, common-law remedy is the thing excepted from the exclusive jurisdiction, not a remedy wholly unknown to that law. The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411, 430, 431, distinctly announced this construction:\n'The cognizance of civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, vested in the District Courts by the ninth section of the Judiciary Act, may be supported upon like considerations. It has been made exclusive by Congress, and that is sufficient, even if we should admit that in the absence of its legislation the state courts might have taken cognizance of these causes. But there are many weighty reasons why it was so declared. 'The admiralty jurisdiction,' says Mr. Justice Story, 'naturally connects itself, on the one hand, with our diplomatic relations and the duties to foreign nations and their subjects, and, on the other hand, with the great interests of navigation and commerce, foreign and domestic. There is, then, a peculiar wisdom in giving to the national government a jurisdiction of this sort which cannot be yielded, except for the general good, and which multiplies the securities for the public peace abroad, and gives to commerce and navigation the most encouraging support at home.'\n\n'The case before us is not within the saving clause of the ninth section. That clause only saves to suitors 'the right of a common-law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it.' It is not a remedy in the common-law courts which is saved, but a common-law remedy. A proceeding in rem, as used in the admiralty courts, is not a remedy afforded by the common law; it is a proceeding under the civil law. When used in the common-law courts, it is given by statute.'\n\n The same view is approved by The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555, 571; The Glide, \n167 \nU.S. 606, 616\n, 617 S., 17 Sup. Ct. 930; and Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey, \n177 \nU.S. 638, 644\n, 648 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 824. \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 129]\n\u00a0\n The latter cause 'was clearly one in personam to enforce a common-law remedy.' The opinion carefully points out that the state court enforced such a remedy and, further (\n177 U.S. 640\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 825), that not until 1866, The Moses Taylor, was the exclusive character of admiralty jurisdiction brought to this court's attention. Earlier opinions must be read accordingly, with Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen and the uniformity of maritime rules in mind. Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry & Machine Co., \n237 \nU.S. 303, 308\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 596, follows Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey.\n Even where permitted by local law, state courts cannot entertain proceedings in rem for the reason stated by the Moses Taylor:\n'A proceeding in rem, as used in the admiralty courts, is not a remedy afforded by the common law; it is a proceeding under the civil law. When used in the common-law courts, it is given by statute.'\n\n The same reason inhibits state courts from enforcing any remedy not recognized at common law when the controversy is within the admiralty cognizance. Common-law remedies are within the saving clause, and no others. It is not enough that one has been provided by statute.\n The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 571, declares:\n'But it could not have been the intention of Congress, by the exception in that section, to give the suitor all such remedies as might afterwards be enacted by state statutes, for this would have enabled the states to make the jurisdiction of their courts concurrent in all cases, by simply providing a statutory remedy for all cases. Thus the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts would be defeated.'\n\n This negatives the suggestion that the remedy of the saving clause includes any means other than proceedings in rem which may be provided for the enforcement of rights or to redress injuries.\n Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey, \n177 U.S. 648\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 829, clearly affirms that the thing saved to suitors is the right of a common-law remedy:\n'The true distinction between \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 130]\n\u00a0\n such proceedings as are and such as are not invasions of the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction is this: If the cause of action be one cognizable in admiralty, and the suit be in rem against the thing itself, though a monition be also issued to the owner, the proceeding is essentially one in admiralty. If, upon the other hand, the cause of action be not one of which a court of admiralty has jurisdiction, or if the suit be in personam against an individual defendant, with an auxiliary attachment against a particular thing, or against the property of the defendant in general, it is essentially a proceeding according to the course of the common law, and within the saving clause of the statute (section 563) of a common-law remedy. The suit in this case being one in equity to enforce a common-law remedy, the state courts were correct in assuming jurisdiction.'\n\n I can find no authority for the broad claim that the 'right of a common-law remedy' extends to any and all means other than proceedings in rem which may be employed to enforce rights or redress injuries, including remedies in pais as well as proceedings in court, those conferred by statute as well as those existing at common law. Neither Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey nor Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry supports it. It conflicts with The Hine v. Trevor, and is clearly opposed by the reason advanced in The Moses Taylor for excluding proceedings in rem from state courts.\n The court below has held9 that the New York Arbitration Law (chapter 275, Laws N. Y. 1920)10 provides 'a statutory \n\n[264 U.S. 109, 131]\n\u00a0\n legal remedy of a character unknown to the common-law ... declares a new public policy and abrogates an ancient rule.' This statutory remedy is not of the common law nor were the proceedings under review instituted to enforce such a remedy, as was Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen.\n If petitioner is right why may not a state require the parties to any maritime contract to submit their controversies to varying methods of arbitration and thus introduce the very discord which framers of the Constitution intended to prevent by adopting general maritime rules as laws of the United States. Also why may it not apply other than common-law remedies to controversies within admiralty jurisdiction contrary to plain congressional enactment and repeated decisions of this court?\n To announce principles is not enough; they should be followed. I think opinions of this court led the conclusion of the court below and require affirmation of its judgment. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mr. Justice Story said (page 821): 'Courts of equity do not refuse to interfere to compel a party specifically to perform an agreement to refer to arbitration, because they wish to discourage arbitrations, as against public policy. On the contrary, they have and can have no just objection to these domestic forums, and will enforce, and promptly interfere to enforce their awards when fairly and lawfully made, without hesitation or question. But when they are asked to proceed farther and to compel the parties to appoint arbitrators whose award shall be final, they necessarily pause to consider whether such tribunals possess adequate means of giving redress, and whether they have a right to compel a reluctant party to submit to such a tribunal, and to close against him the doors of the common courts of justice, provided by the government to protect rights and to redress wrongs.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, also, Thornton v. Carson, 7 Cranch, 596; Carnochan v. Christie, 11 Wheat. 446; Lutz v. Linthicum, 8 Pet. 165; The Alexandria Canal Co. v. Swann, 5 How. 83; New York & Cumberland R. R. Co. v. Myers, 18 How. 246; Newcomb v. Wood, \n97 U.S. 581\n, 583. The practice of making the agreement for arbitration a rule of court was introduced by Stat. 9 & 10 William III, c. 15. See Russell on Arbitrators (5th Ed.) 52. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] In England maritime controversies were settled by arbitration as early as 1320. Selden Society, Select Pleas in the Court of Admiralty, vol. 1, pp. xxii, xxiii. After the establishment of that court (about 1340, Id. xiv.) arbitration became a common mode of settling disputes in shipping cases. 'The parties appear to have usually executed a bond or entered into recognizance in the admiralty court to execute the award; there are several suits to enforce such a bond or to compel performance of the award.'

C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Louis Marshall, of New York City, and Davis G. Arnold, of Providence, R. I., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent Pothier and another were duly indicted-October 13, 1922- for the murder of Alexander P. Cronkhite, on October 25, 1918, 'within and on lands theretofore acquired for the exclusive use of the United States, and under the exclusive jurisdiction thereof, and within the Southern division of the Western district of Washington, to wit, within and on the Camp Lawis Military Reservation.' Pothier was arrested in the state of Rhode Island and, after hearings before the commissioner and the District Court, a warrant for his removal was directed as provided by section 1014, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St.  1674). By this habeas corpus proceeding the validity of the warrant is questioned and respondent's release sought. His contention is that the United States had not acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the place of the crime as alleged by the indictment, because they had not then received a deed to the land. \n\n[264 U.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n The District Court said and held (In re Pothier, 285 Fed. 632):\n'The argument of the defense is that by the terms of the statute the passing of the deed is a prerequisite to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and that, as the deed postdates the time of the alleged murder, the United States did not than have exclusive jurisdiction over the lands conveyed by said deed. But the evidence shows also that before the passage of the deeds, and before the date of the alleged murder, Pierce county, acting as the arm and agent of the state, had acquired by condemnation, and had turned over to the United States military authorities, many tracts of land comprised within the Camp Lewis Military Reservation, which had been selected by a representative of the Secretary of War, and which, when donated to the United States, the Secretary of War had been authorized to accept. Buildings had been erected and the camp permanently occupied before January 29, 1918, and before July, 1918, there were 50,000 men in camp. There is much evidence tending to show that as to a number of the tracts of land comprised in the camp there was, before the date of the alleged crime, a practical consummation of the donation, and that the agents of the county and of the United States had done all that it was necessary to do in order to vest title and exclusive jurisdiction in the United States, save the execution and recording of the deeds whereby the title of the United States should be evidenced. The contention of the United States that the evidence of de facto exercise of exclusive jurisdiction is sufficient in itself to show probable cause cannot be disregarded, in view of the quaere in Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245, 252\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 2, 6 (54 L. Ed. 1021, 20 Ann. Cas. 1138): 'The documents referred to are not before us, but they properly were introduced, and so far as we can see justified the finding of the jury, even if the evidence of the de facto exercise of exclusive jurisdiction was not enough, or if the United States was called \n\n[264 U.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n on to try title in a murder case.' ... I am of the opinion that the defendant has failed to overcome the prima facie case made by the indictment, and that the evidence fails to show the want of probable cause.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals (Pothier v. Rodman, 291 Fed. 311) was--\n'of the opinion that no other conclusion can be drawn from the evidence than that, at the time the crime charged in the indictment was committed, the United States had acquired no title in the land embraced within Camp Lewis Military Reservation; that the sovereignty of the state over the tract had not then been yielded up, and was not until the deed, map, etc., were filed in the office of the county auditor of Pierce county for record, which was not until November 15, 1919, more than a year after the alleged murder. This being so, there is an absolute want of probable cause for the removal of the appellant to answer to the crime charged. Greene v. Henkel, \n183 \nU.S. 249, 261\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 218.'\n\n It accordingly reversed the judgment of the District Court and directed Pothier's discharge.\n We think there was enough to show probable cause and that the judgment of the District Court is correct. Whether the locus of the alleged crime was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States demands consideration of many facts and seriously controverted questions of law. As heretofore often pointed out, these matters must be determined by the court where the indictment was found. The regular course may not be anticipated by alleging want of jurisdiction and demanding a ruling thereon in a habeas corpus proceeding. Barring certain exceptional cases ( unlike the present one), this court--\n'has uniformly held that the hearing on habeas corpus is not in the nature of a writ of error, nor is it intended as a substitute for the functions of the trial court. Manifestly, this is true as to disputed questions of fact, and it is equally so as to disputed matters of law, whether they relate to the sufficiency of the indictment or \n\n[264 U.S. 399, 403]\n\u00a0\n the validity of the statute on which the charge is based. These and all other controverted matters of law and fact are for the determination of the trial court.' Henry v. Henkel, \n235 \nU.S. 219, 229\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 54, 57 (59 L. Ed. 203); Louie v.

MANUFACTURERS' FINANCE CO.(1924)\nNo. 74\nArgued: October 14, 1923Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Alexander Whiteside, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.[ Salem Trust Co. v. Manufacturers' Finance Co. \n264 U.S. 182\n (1924) ]\n\n\n[264 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert G. Dodge, of Boston, Mass., for respondents.\n\n\n[264 U.S. 182, 187]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On May 16, 1919, the Nelson Blower & Furnace Company, a Massachusetts corporation, assigned to the petitioner for a valuable consideration indebtedness to the amount of $45,000 due or to become due to the Nelson Company from the Murray & Tregurtha Corporation, under a contract whereby the Nelson Company was to construct certain engines for the latter. July 15, 1919, \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n the Nelson Company for a valid consideration assigned to the respondent Manufacturers' Finance Company the same indebtedness to the amount of $40, 000, and on September 20 made another assignment to the Finance Company of the same indebtedness to the amount of $10,000. Later, about the lastmentioned date, the Finance Company notified the debtor of its assignment. Up to that time it had made no inquiry of the debtor as to its indebtedness to the Nelson Company, and neither it nor the debtor had any knowledge of the prior assignment to the petitioner. September 26, 1919, the United States District Court in a suit in equity appointed a receiver of the Nelson Company. About that time each assignee learned of the assignment to the other. October 6, 1919, petitioner and respondent Finance Company agreed that the Nelson Company, acting by its receiver, should finish the work being done for the debtor, and that the net proceeds, which amounted to $7,963.36, a sum less than the amount of the claim of either assignee, should be deposited with the respondent International Trust Company, a Massachusetts corporation, in a special account in the name of the Finance Company as trustee for the one or the other of such assignees thereafter to be agreed by them, or found by some court of competent jurisdiction to be entitled thereto. They failed to agree, and petitioner brought a bill in equity in the state court against the respondents to establish its right to the amount so on deposit, and to have the same paid to it. For the removal of the suit to the District Court of the United States, the Finance Company filed its petition, stating that the International Trust Company is not a necessary party to the suit, but is a mere nominal party, being only a stakeholder and without any interest whatever in the result, and that the controversy in the suit is entirely between citizens of different states, Salem Trust Company, a Massachusetts corporation, and the Manufacturers' Finance \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 189]\n\u00a0\n Company, a Delaware corporation. Other proper steps were taken, and the case was removed from the state to the federal court. Petitioner moved to remand, asserting that the International Trust Company is a necessary party to the suit, and that the case was improperly removed, because the plaintiff and one of the defendants are citizens of the same state. The motion was denied. The case was tried in the District Court, and dismissed on final decree, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n There are two questions for decision: Did the District Court have jurisdiction? Which of the parties is entitled to the fund?\n The District Courts have original jurisdiction of controversies between citizens of different states (Constitution, art. 3,  2; Judicial Code,  24 [Comp. St.  991]); and when in any suit brought in a state court, there is a controversy, which is wholly between citizens of different states, and which can be fully determined as between them, a defendant interested in such controversy may remove the suit to the proper District Court of the United States. (Judicial Code,  28 [Comp. St.  1010]). District Courts have jurisdiction if all the parties on the one side are of citizenship diverse to those on the other side. \n1\n Jurisdiction cannot be defeated by joining formal or unnecessary parties. \n2\n The right of removal depends upon the case disclosed by the pleadings when the petition therefore is filed (Barney v. Latham, \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 190]\n\u00a0\n \n103 U.S. 205\n, 215; Ex parte Nebraska, \n209 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 581), and is not affected by the fact that one of the defendants is a citizen of the same state as the plaintiff, if that defendant is not an indispensable party to the controversy between plaintiff and defendant who are citizens of different states (Barney v. Latham, supra, 213). The facts set forth in the present bill are substantially those already stated. This suit involves a controversy between the petitioner, a citizen of Massachusetts, and the respondent the Finance Company, a citizen of Delaware, which can be determined without affecting any interest of the other respondent, the International Trust Company, a citizen of Massachusetts. The latter is not an indispensable party. See Niles-Bement Co. v. Iron Moulders Union, \n254 \nU.S. 77, 80\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 39. It has no interest in the controversy between the petitioner and the other respondent. Its only obligation is to pay over the amount deposited with it when it is ascertained which of the other parties is entitled to it. On the question of jurisdiction, an unnecessary and dispensable party, will not be considered. Walden v. Skinner, \n101 U.S. 577\n, 589; Bacon v. Rives, \n106 \nU.S. 99, 104\n, 1 S. Sup. Ct. 3; Ex parte Nebraska, supra. The cases of Wilson v. Oswego Township, \n151 U.S. 56\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 259, and Construction Co. v. Cane Creek, \n155 U.S. 283\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 91, do not support the contention that this case was not properly removed to the federal court. These cases hold that where the object of the suit is to recover possession of personal property the one in possession is a necessary and indispensable, and not a formal, party. Here no cause of action exists against the International Trust Company, because it has not been determined which of the other parties is entitled to payment. The District Court had jurisdiction. The motion to remand was rightly denied.\n As between successive assignees of the same account receivable, does prior notice to the debtor of the later assignment, without more, subordinate the rights of the earlier to those of the later assignee? \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 191]\n\u00a0\n There is a conflict of authority on the question. Under decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which are in harmony with the decisions of the highest courts in a number of the states,3 the earlier assignee would prevail. The court below held the question to be one of general jurisprudence, declined to be bound by the Massachusetts chusetts decisions, and followed what they understood the rule to be, as applied by this and other federal courts,4 and in a number of the states,5 and decided that the later assignee, the first to give notice to the debtor, is entitled to the money.\n The question is one of general law, not based on any legislation of the state or local law or usage, and the \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 192]\n\u00a0\n lower court rightly decided that it was not bound by the rule applied in the decisions of the highest court of Massachusetts.

A. 327.\n The precise question now before us was not involved, and therefore was not decided, in any of the decisions of this court cited by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n In Judson v. Corcoran, 17 How. 612, one Williams had a claim against Mexico for the illegal confiscation of a cargo. Under a treaty with Mexico (9 Stat. 922) such claims were to be adjusted by the United States upon allowance by a board of commissioners created by an act of Congress. 9 Stat. 393. Judson obtained from Williams an assignment of an interest in the claim. Later Corcoran obtained assignments covering the whole claim. The board found that Corcoran owned the whole claim and made an award in his favor. Judson set up no pretensions to the claim until after the award, some six years from the time he obtained the assignment. This court (17 How. 614) pointed out that the assignor, having parted with his interest by the first assignment, the second assignee could take nothing by the later assignment; that the purchaser is entitled only to the remedies of the seller, and hence has arisen the maxim that 'he who is first in time is best in right.' The second assignee had drawn to his equity a legal title to the fund (the award of the board of commissioners), and it was said that-assuming that no negligence could be imputed to the earlier assignee and that the case was one where an equity in the same chose in action was successively assigned to two innocent persons whose equities are equal-there must be applied the rule that 'the equities being equal the law must prevail.' \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 193]\n\u00a0\n The court said (17 How. 615):\n'There may be cases in which a purchaser, by sustaining the character of a bona fide assignee, will be in a better situation than the person was of whom he bought; as, for instance, where the purchaser, who alone had made inquiry and given notice to the debtor, or to a trustee holding the fund, (as in this instance,) would be preferred over the prior purchaser, who neglected to give notice of his assignment, and warn others not to buy.'\n\n Judson took his assignment in 1845 and first produced it in 1851. In the meantime, Corcoran got his assignment, gave notice, and prosecuted it to final award. It was held that he was entitled to the fund. Clearly that case does not hold that mere priority of notice by a later assignee will subordinate the rights of the first purchaser.\n In Spain v. Hamilton's Administrator, 1 Wall. 604, the fund was onetenth of the amount to be received from the United States on account of bonds of the Republic of Texas, after payment of a debt owed by a bank to one Wetmore, which the bonds were pledged to secure. Wetmore was trustee to make collection. The bank gave Hamilton an order on him for the fund. Hamilton made the following assignments: February 12, 1850, to Spain in general terms, without limit as to amount and not identifying the fund; August 30, 1850, to Wetmore for $2,500; September 21, 1850, to Corcoran & Riggs for $30,000, which was presented to and accepted by Wetmore; April 30, 1851, to Robb, the whole fund, subject to Wetmore's claim and that of Corcoran & Riggs. Robb gave notice immediately and later obtained judgment and made seizure of the residuary fund. Hill succeeded to the rights of Robb. The one-tenth covered by the order of the bank in favor of Hamilton was left in the treasury, subject to the assignments. May 10, 1856, Spain brought suit, claiming the fund under the document of February 12, 1850. Up to this time, neither Wetmore nor any of \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 194]\n\u00a0\n the other assignees had heard of Spain's claim against the fund.\n In its decision, this court referred to Spain's negligence and delay. It adverted to the rule that the assignee is entitled to the remedies of the assignor and is subject to all the equities between him and his debtor, and said (1 Wall. 624):\n'But in order to perfect his title against the debtor it is indispensable that the assignee, should immediately give notice of the assignment to the debtor, for otherwise a priority of right may be obtained by a subsequent assignee, or the debt may be discharged by a payment to the assignee [assignor] before such notice.'\n\n If a debtor pays, or becomes bound to pay, a later assignee, he is not liable to an earlier assignee who failed to give him notice of his assignment. And if, without notice of any assignment, he pays the assignor he cannot be held by the assignee. To safeguard against such things, it is necessary for an assignee to give the debtor notice of his assignment. But it does not follow that mere priority of notice of the later assignee, who took nothing by his assignment, will subordinate the rights of an earlier assignee. That case does not establish or apply the rule contended for by respondent.\n In Laclede Bank v. Schuler, \n120 U.S. 511\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 644, it was held that a bank is not liable to a holder of a check which was not presented for payment until after the drawer had made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, and directed the bank to hold the fund subject to the order of the assignee. This case does not support the rule applied by the Circuit Court of Appeals. A check in usual form does not constitute an assignment. It is an order which may be countermanded at any time before it is cashed. Fourth Street Bank v. Yardley, \n165 \nU.S. 635, 643\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 439; Florence Mining Co. v. Brown, \n124 \nU.S. 385, 391\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 531.\n The doctrine that mere priority of notice to trustee or debtor gives priority of right to a later assignee over an \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 195]\n\u00a0\n earlier assignee of a chose in action is generally referred to Dearle v. Hall and Loveridge v. Cooper, 3 Russell, 1, decided at the same time and upon the same principle. The leading case is Dearle v. Hall. In that case, there was much more in favor of the second assignee than mere priority of notice. Brown, cestui que trust under his father's will, made three assignments of income payable to him during his life by the executors. The two earlier assignments were made to Dearle and Sherring, respectively. Each was for a part of the annual income. By the terms of the assignments the assignor was permitted to continue to collect, and for years he did collect the income assigned. No notice of the earlier assignments was given to the executors Before he purchased, Hall, the latest assignee, diligently inquired of the trustees as to Brown's title and the amount of income paid him. The trustees knew of no assignments, and without any suspicion of prior incumbrance, Hall in good faith purchased the entire claim. He gave immediate notice of his assignment to the trustees and received assurance that the income would be paid to him. When it became due, an instalment was paid to him. Thereafter, the earlier assignees gave notice and demanded payment under their respective assignments. The trustees withheld all payments. Suit was brought by Dearle and Sherring against Hall to establish priority of their assignments over his. In the lower court, Sir Thomas Plumer, M. R., gave judgment in favor of Hall, and it was affirmed by Lord Lyndhurst, L. C. Two grounds of the decision may be gathered from the opinions: (1) That the negligence of the prior assignees in failing to give notice to the trustees resulted in Hall being induced to purchase without knowledge of the prior assignments. (2) That notice to the trustees was necessary to perfect title-as, 'the act of giving the trustee notice is in a certain degree taking possession of the fund.' See Ward v. Duncombe, L. R. 3 A. C. (1893) 369, 387. These cases \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 196]\n\u00a0\n did not decide that notice by a subsequent assignee after his purchase, without any inquiry in advance of his purchase, will subordinate the title of the prior assignor to that of the later. No such questions were involved. But later, in the case of Foster v. Cockerell, in the House of Lords, 3 Cl. & F. 456, that question was decided in favor of the subsequent assignee, and it appears to have become the settled rule in England. However, it has been the subject of much discussion and explanation by the English courts. See Wilmot v. Pike, 5 Hare, 14; Ward v. Duncombe, supra. It appears that in 1814 in Cooper v. Fynmore, 3 Russell, 60 Sir Thomas Plumer, v. C., himself decided that mere neglect of notice was not sufficient to postpone the first assignee, and held (page 64): 'In order to deprive him of his priority, it was necessary that there should be such laches, as in a court of equity amounted to fraud.' In 1827, Dearle v. Hall and Loveridge v. Cooper were decided. In 1833, Lord Lyndhurst, then Chief Baron, in Smyth v. Smith, 2 Cr. & M. 231, in the Court of Exchequer, held that the second assignee in order to obtain priority must show that he exercised proper caution in taking the assignment, and that he had applied to the trustees to know if any previous assignment had been made, and that, unless he so applied to each of the trustees, he would not have exercised due caution or done all that he ought to have done. Lord Herschell, in Ward v. Duncombe, supra, said ( page 380):\n'The language thus used by the Chief Baron is somewhat remarkable. It would see, if correctly reported, to indicate the view that a second incumbrancer would only obtain priority over an earlier one if he had used due caution, and had, in fact, made such inquiry as a prudent man would of each of the trustees. This view is in direct conflict with the decision of this House two years later in Foster v. Cockerell, in which Lord Lyndhurst himself delivered the leading opinion.'\n\n Undoubtedly the first application of \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 197]\n\u00a0\n the rule that mere priority of notice gives priority of right was in Foster v. Cockerell, but it is always referred to Dearle v. Hall and Loveridge v. Cooper. In Ward v. Duncombe, the earlier decisions by which the rule was established were discussed by Lord Herschell and Lord McNaghton. The opinions leave the impression that the rule itself was not deemed to be wholly satisfactory, and that it is not very clear upon what principle it rests. Ward v. Duncombe, supra, 391.\n There is no decision of this court which sustains the contention that, as between sucessive assignees of the same chose in action, mere priority of notice gives priority of right. It seems to us that the better reasons are against such a rule. By the first assignment, the rights of the assignor pass to the assignee. The creditor has a right to dispose of his own property as he chooses and to require the debt to be paid as he directs without the assent of the debtor. See Story, Equity Jurisprudence ( 11th Ed.)  1057. Notice of the assignment to the debtor adds nothing to the right or title transferred. A subsequent assignee takes nothing by his assignment, because the assignor has nothing to give. See Judson v. Corcoran, supra, 17 How. 614. If, after assignment, the assignor receives payment from the debtor, he is liable to the assignee. Failure of the first assignee to give notice does not divest him of any title or right or vest any claim in a subsequent purchaser. It cannot injuriously affect an intending purchaser who makes no inquiry of the debtor concerning the assignor's title. The debtor is not bound to answer inquiries concerning the assignor's title, and there can be no assurance that an intending purchaser can ascertain the incumbrance by inquiry of the debtor having notice of the earlier assignment. Low v. Bouverie, \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 1891]\n\u00a0\n L. R. 3 Ch. 82, 99. Compare Ward v. Duncombe, supra, 393. It is impossible to eliminate all risk from such a transaction. If the second assignee elects to rely on the \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 198]\n\u00a0\n representations of the vendor as to his title, and is deceived, he cannot shift his loss to the first assignee, unless some act or omission of the latter was proximate to the deception.\n Facts and circumstances may create an equitable estoppel against the first assignee. Herman v. Mutual Life Insurance Co., 218 Mass. 181, 105 N. E. 450, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 822; Rabinowitz v. People's National Bank, 235 Mass. 102, 126 N. E. 289.6 It would be unconscionable to permit him to prevail over a later assignee whom he had misled or deceived in respect of the assignor's title at the time of purchase by the latter. But, assuming a duty on the first purchaser to protect a subsequent assignee against deception and fraud by the assignor, there is no ground for subordinating his claim, unless his failure was an element in or contributed to the deception. In the absence of inquiry by the subsequent purchaser, the failure of the first to give notice is immaterial.\n In a case where, as here, the later assignee has made no inquiry of the debtor in advance of taking his assignment, there is no analogy between the giving of notice by the \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 199]\n\u00a0\n first assignee to the debtor and the taking of possession of tangible personal property by a purchaser. It is impossible in any real sense to transfer possession of accounts receivable or the like, and, as to them, an assignee does not become clothed with the indicia of ownership as does one taking possession of tangible things. It is not accurate to say that notice is necessary to perfect title in the assignee of a chose in action. While failure to give notice may become an important element in a situation from which equitable estoppel may arise against the first assignee, it cannot be said to be necessary to or an element in acquisition of title.\n The result will be the same if it be assumed that each bona fide purchaser takes merely an equity in the chose in action assigned. If equities are equal, the first in time is best in right. Otherwise the stronger equity will prevail. While there are contingencies which entitle the second to prevail over the first assignee,7 we hold that mere priority of notice to the debtor by a second assignee, who lent his money to the assignor without making any inquiry of the \n\n[264 U.S. 182, 200]\n\u00a0\n debtor, is not sufficient to subordinate the first assignment to the second. The petitioner is entitled to the fund.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur on the ground that the rights of the parties are governed by the law of Massachusetts. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Raphael v.

Duncombe, Lord McNaghton said (page 391):\n'The general principle applicable to all equitable titles is, I think, well expressed by Lord Cairns in Shropshire Union Railways & Canal Company v. The Queen, L. R. 7 E. & I. at page 506: 'A preexisting equitable title,' said Lord Cairns, 'may be defeated by a supervening legal title obtained by transfer.' He was there speaking of an equitable title to shares. Then he goes on: 'And I agree with what has been contended, that it may also be defeated by conduct, by representations, by misstatements of a character which would operate and enure to forfeit and to take away the pre-existing equitable title. But I conceive it to be clear and undoubted law, and law the enforcement of which is required for the safety of mankind, that in order to take away any pre-existing admitted equitable title, that which is relied upon for such a purpose must be shewn and proved by those upon whom the burden to shew and prove it lies, and that it must amount to something tangible and distinct, something which can have the grave and strong effect to accomplish the purpose for which it is said to have been produced.\" \n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In Professor James Barr Ames' Cases on Trusts (2d Ed.), in a note on Dearle v. Hall, it is said (page 328): 'Whatever view may be entertained as to the English doctrine which prefers the assignee who first gives notice, the second assignee is in several contingencies clearly entitled to supplant the first assignee. E. g.: (1) If, acting in good faith, he obtains payment of the claim assigned; Judson v. Corcoran, 17 How. 612; Bridge v. Conn. Company, 152 Mass. 343; Bentley v. Root, 5 Paige, 632, 640; or (2) if he reduces his claim to a judgment in his own name; Judson v. Corcoran, 17 How. 612; Mercantile Company v. Corcoran, 1 Gray, 75; or (3) if he effects a novation with the obligor, whereby the obligation in favor of the assignor is superseded by a new one running to himself, N. Y. Company v. Schuyler, 34 N. Y. 30, 80; Strange v. Houston Company, 53 Tex. 162; or (4) if he obtains the document, containing the obligation, when the latter is in the form of a specialty. In re Gillespie, 15 Fed. 734; Bridge v. Conn. Company, 152 Mass. 343; Fisher v. Knox, 13 Pa. 622. In all these cases, having obtained a legal right in good faith and for value, the prior assignee cannot properly deprive him of this legal right.' \n\n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSALINGER v. LOISEL(1924)\nNo. 341\nArgued: Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 224, 225]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. B. I. Salinger, of Carroll, Iowa, and St. Clair Adams, of New Orleans, La., for Salinger.\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for Loisel.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These three cases involve certain phases of a protracted resistance by B. I. Salinger, Jr., to an effort by the United \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 226]\n\u00a0\n States to have him removed to the district of South Dakota to answer an indictment for a violation there of section 215 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10385), which makes it a punishable offense to use the mail for the purpose of executing a scheme or artifice to defraud.\n The indictment was returned in the District Court for the District of South Dakota when sitting in the Western division, and the offense was charged as committed in the Southern division; but the grand jury which returned the indictment had been impaneled from the body of the district, regardless of the divisions, and instructed to inquire into and make due presentment of offenses committed in any part of the district. After receiving the indictment, the court, at the suggestion of the United States attorney, remitted it to the Southern division for trial and other proceedings. A bench warrant was issued for Salinger's arrest, and he appeared before a commissioner in Iowa and gave bond for his appearance in the Southern division on the first day of the next term. But he failed to appear, and the bond was declared forfeited.\n Later, Salinger being in New York City, a proceeding was begun before a commissioner there for his arrest and removal to South Dakota under section 1014 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1674). He was arrested, taken before the commissioner, and accorded a hearing. The indictment was produced, he admitted he was the person charged, and on the evidence presented the commissioner found there was probable cause and committed him to await the issue of a warrant of removal. He then sued out a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for that district; but after a hearing the court discharged the writ, remanded him to the marshal's custody, and issued a warrant for his removal. On his appeal, that decision was reviewed and affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In re Salinger, 288 Fed. 752. He made no attempt to obtain any other or further review. When the mandate of the \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 227]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Court of Appeals went down, to avoid being removed in the custody of the marshal, he gave a bond for his appearance two weeks hence in South Dakota. Again he failed to appear, and that bond was declared forfeited.\n After giving the bond in New York, and before the day stipulated therein for his appearance in South Dakota, Salinger went to New Orleans, appeared with a representative of the surety in that bond before a commissioner there, and was surrendered by the surety's representative to the marshal of that district in the commissioner's presence. Such a surrender in a distant district may not have been in accord with section 1018 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1682), and may not have discharged the surety; but nothing turns on that here. The surrender seems to have been made with Salinger's full consent; but, however made, it constituted no obstacle to further proceedings for his removal. The commissioner accordingly directed that he be held in the marshal's custody to await the institution of such a proceeding. He then sued out a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court at New Orleans and was admitted to bail pending a hearing on the writ.\n In a few days-during which Salinger failed to appear in South Dakota as stipulated in the bond given in New York-a proceeding for his arrest and removal under section 1014 was begun before the commissioner in New Orleans. He was arrested, taken before the commissioner, and accorded a hearing. The indictment was produced; evidence was presented tending to show he was the person charged, and he gave testimony tending to show he was not in South Dakota at the times he was charged with unlawfully using the mail. On all the evidence the commissioner found the requisite identity and probable cause, and committed him to await the issue of a warrant for his removal. He then sued out another writ of habeas corpus in the District Court, and was admitted to bail pending a hearing on the writ. \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 228]\n\u00a0\n On a hearing in the two cases, all the proceedings in South Dakota, New York, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and New Orleans, which have been recited herein were produced in evidence, and on consideration thereof the court discharged both writs of habeas corpus, remanded Salinger to the marshal's custody, and issued a warrant for his removal. Direct appeals to this court in two cases were then prayed by Salinger and allowed by the District Court; it being especially directed in both cases that the appeal operate as a supersedeas on Salinger's giving approved bail. The bail was given and approved. These cases are Nos. 341 and 342.\n Notwithstanding the supersedeas so effected, Salinger was taken into custody by the marshal under the warrant of removal with a view to executing its command. He then sued out a third writ of habeas corpus in the District Court; his petition therefor being like his earlier petitions, save as in it he additionally complained that his detention under the warrant of removal was in contravention of the supersedeas allowed on the appeals in Nos. 341 and 342. After a hearing the District Court discharged the writ of habeas corpus and remanded him to the marshal's custody for removal under the warrant. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where the decision was affirmed. Salinger v. United States, 295 Fed. 498. The case is here on certiorari (\n263 U.S. 683\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 136, 68 L. Ed. --), and is No. 705. Bail in this case was allowed and given here when certiorari was granted.\n In disposing of the additional ground of complaint advanced in No. 705, the Circuit Court of Appeals proceeded on the assumption that there were three distinct warrants of removal, and that one of these was neither involved in the appeals in Nos. 341 and 342 nor covered by the supersedeas. But the assumption was not well founded. There was but one proceeding for removal before the \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 229]\n\u00a0\n commissioner in New Orleans and it was based on the single indictment in South Dakota. There was also but one commitment for removal in that proceeding. The warrant of removal issued by the District Court was based expressly on that commitment; but for reasons not explained the warrant was issued in triplicate. In substance, form, and date the three papers were identical. Taken either collectively or separately, they embodied a single command, which was that the marshal 'forthwith' remove Salinger to South Dakota and there deliver him to the proper authority to be dealt with under the indictment. To execute the command of one triplicate was to execute that of all. In legal effect, therefore, there was one warrant, not three. One was all that was sought, and no basis was laid for more. The obvious purpose of the supersedeas was to stay the execution of the command for removal pending the appeals to this court in Nos. 341 and 342, and of course that purpose could not be thwarted by merely duplicating or triplicating the warrant embodying the command. It follows that the additional ground of complaint advanced in No. 705 was well taken. But, as that ground could be effective only during the life of the supersedeas in Nos. 341 and 342, it has no bearing on the decision to be given in them on the right to remove.\n Before coming to the questions presented in those cases we think the procedure which was followed in them calls for comment. The first case was begun when Salinger was committed by the commissioner to await a proceeding for his removal. Later, when such a proceeding was begun and the commissioner definitely committed him to await the issue of a warrant of removal, that change in the situation should have been shown in the first case by an appropriate amendment or supplement to the petition, instead of being made the basis of a new and separate case. And when, in disregard of the propriety of taking that course, \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 230]\n\u00a0\n the second case was begun, the two should have been consolidated and conducted as one. The parties were the same and the cases presented a single controversy. Maintaining them separately was productive of confusion, and led to two appeals to this court, when, had the right course been taken, one appeal plainly would have sufficed, and would have lessened by one-half the printing and other costs. As it is now, one record is largely a duplication of what appears in the other, and both are exceedingly confusing. The course that was taken should not have been selected, nor should the court have permitted it.\n In Nos. 341 and 342 the right to arrest and remove in virtue of the indictment was questioned on the same grounds that were set up in the earlier case in New York, where that right was upheld. Because of this situation, counsel for the appellee invoke the doctrine of res judicata and insist that the decision in the New York case was a final adjudication of the right and is binding on all other courts, including this court. We are unable to go so far. At common law the doctrine of res judicata did not extend to a decision on habeas corpus refusing to discharge the prisoner. The state courts generally have accepted that rule where not modified by statute; the lower federal courts usually have given effect to it; and this court has conformed to it and thereby sanctioned it, although announcing no express decision on the point. The cases of Carter v. McClaughry, \n183 \nU.S. 365, 378\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 181, and Ex parte Spencer, \n228 \nU.S. 652, 658\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 709, are notable instances. We regard the rule as well established in this jurisdiction.\n But it does not follow that a refusal to discharge on one application is without bearing or weight when a later application is being considered. In early times, when a refusal to discharge was not open to appellate review, courts and judges were accustomed to exercise an independent \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 231]\n\u00a0\n judgment on each successive application, regardless of the number. But when a right to an appellate review was given, the reason for that practice ceased, and the practice came to be materially changed-just as, when a right to a comprehensive review in criminal cases was given, the scope of inquiry deemed admissible on habeas corpus came to be relatively narrowed.\n The federal statute (section 761, Rev. Stat. [Comp. St.  1289]) does not lay down any specific rule on the subject, but directs the court 'to dispose of the party as law and justice require.' A study of the cases will show that this has been construed as meaning that each application is to be disposed of in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion guided and controlled by a consideration of whatever has a rational bearing on the propriety of the discharge sought. Among the matters which may be considered, and even given controlling weight, are (a) the existence of another remedy, such as a right in ordinary course to an appellate review in the criminal case; and (b) a prior refusal to discharge on a like application.

C .) 40 Fed. 62; In re Simmons (C. C.) 45 Fed. 241; Ex parte Moebus (C. C.) 148 Fed. 39; In re Kopel (D. C.) 148 Fed. 505. The decision in the Cuddy Case was on a second application, and was given by Mr. Justice Field. While holding the doctrine of res judicata inapplicable, he said:\n'The officers before whom the second application is made may take into consideration the fact that a previous application had been made to another officer and refused; and in some instances that fact may justify a refusal of the second. The action of the court or justice on the second application will naturally be \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 232]\n\u00a0\n affected to some degree by the character of the court or officer to whom the first application was made, and the fullness of the consideration given to it.'\n\n In practice the rules we here have outlined will accord to the writ of habeas corpus its recognized status as a privileged writ of freedom, and yet make against an abusive use of it. As a further safeguard against abuse, the court, if not otherwise informed, may on receiving an application for the writ require the applicant to show whether he has made a prior application, and, if so, what action was had on it.\n Here the prior refusal to discharge was by a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction and was affirmed in a considered opinion by a Circuit Court of Appeals. Had the District Court disposed of the later applications on that ground, its discretion would have been well exercised, and we should sustain its action, without saying more. But its decision does not appear to have been put on that ground; and, as circumstances are disclosed which make it appropriate that we consider and pass on two of the objections urged against a removal, we turn to them.\n Both objections go to the jurisdiction of the court before which it is proposed to take and try the accused. One is that under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution there can be no trial in the District of South Dakota, because the indictment shows that the offense charged was not committed in that district but in a district in Iowa, and the other that, even if the indictment be taken as charging an offense in the District of South Dakota, it shows that it was returned in a division of that district other than the one in which the offense was committed.\n It must be conceded that under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution the accused cannot be tried in one district on an indictment showing that the offense was not committed in that district; and it also must be conceded that there is no authority for a removal to a district \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 233]\n\u00a0\n other than one in which the Constitution permits the trial to be had. We proceed therefore to inquire whether it appears, as claimed, that the offense was not committed in the district to which removal is sought.\n The material part of section 215 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10385) on which the indictment is based reads:\n'Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, ... shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice ... place, or cause to be placed, any letter ... in any post office, ... or authorized depository for mail matter, to be sent or delivered ... or shall knowingly cause to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon ... any such letter, ... shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.'\n\n The indictment charges that the defendants, of whom Salinger is one, devised a scheme and artifice to defraud divers persons by means described and thereafter for the purpose and with the intent of executing their scheme and artifice did unlawfully and knowingly 'cause to be delivered by mail,' according to the direction thereon, at Viborg within the Southern division of the district of South Dakota, a certain letter directed to a named person at that place; the letter and the direction being particularly described. The indictment then adds, in an explanatory way ( see Horner v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 207, 213\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 407), that on the day preceding the delivery the defendants had caused the letter to be placed in the mail at Sioux City, Iowa, for delivery at Viborg according to the direction thereon. There were other counts in the indictment, but they need not be particularly noticed, for the one just described is a fair sample of all.\n Section 215 is a re-enactment, with changes, of an earlier statute which made it an offense for the deviser of a scheme or artifice to defraud to place or cause to be placed \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 234]\n\u00a0\n in the mail any letter in furtherance thereof, but did not contain the clause making it also an offense for the deviser to cause such a letter 'to be delivered by the mail according to the direction thereon.' Under the original statute the offense was held to be complete when the letter was placed in the mail depository for transmission, and the place of the deposit was held to be the place of commission, regardless of whether or where the letter was delivered. The appellant insists that the introduction of the new clause into the statute as re-enacted is not of material significance here. We are of a different opinion. That clause plainly provides for the punishment of the deviser of the scheme or artifice where he causes a letter in furtherance of it to be delivered by the mail according to the direction on the letter. This is done by way of enlarging the original definition of the offense, the clause dealing with the placing of such a letter in a mail depository being retained. Evidently Congress intended to make the statute more effective and to that end to change it so that where the letter is delivered according to the direction, such wrongful use of the mail may be dealt with in the district of the delivery as well as in that of the deposit. A letter may be mailed without being delivered, but if it be delivered according to the address the person who causes the mailing causes the delivery. Not only so, but the place at which he causes the delivery is the place at which it is brought about in regular course by the agency which he uses for the purpose. United States v. Kenofskey, \n243 \nU.S. 440, 443\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 438. Were the government attempting to prosecute at both places, a question might arise as to whether it should be required to elect between them (see Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 474\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 249, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112); but, as there is no such attempt here, that question need not be considered. The appellant relies on United States v. Stever, \n222 U.S. 167\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 51, as showing that the offense was committed at the place of the deposit and not at that \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 235]\n\u00a0\n of the delivery; but the case is not in point. It arose before the statute was changed. The indictment there was in two counts. One was based on the original statute and was expressly abandoned by the government. The other was based on another statute relating to the use of the mail in promoting lotteries and other schemes of chance.\n We conclude that there is no sound basis for the claim that the indictment shows that the offense was not committed in the district to which removal is sought. An effort was made to strengthen that claim by producing testimony tending to show that Salinger was not in that district at the time. But of that effort it suffices to say that the nature of the offense is such that he could have committed it, or have participated in its commission, even though he was not then in the district. In re Palliser, \n136 U.S. 257\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 1034; Horner v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 207, 213\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 407; Burton v. United States, \n202 \nU.S. 344, 386\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 688, 6 Ann. Cas. 362.\n The objection that the indictment was not returned in the division in which it charges the offense was committed, and therefore that jurisdiction could not be founded on it, is based on a provision of section 53 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1035) reading as follows:\n'When a district contains more than one division, ... all prosecutions for crimes or offenses shall be had within the division ... where the same were committed, unless the court, or the judge thereof, upon the application of the defendant, shall order the cause to be transferred for prosecution to another division of the district.'\n\n South Dakota constitutes a single judicial district, with one District Court; but the district is divided into four divisions, where sessions are held at times fixed by law, such sessions, whether in one division or another, being 'successive terms of one and the same court.' Hollister v. United States, 145 Fed. 773, 782, 76 C. C. A. 337, 346. A like situation exists in many of the states. \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 236]\n\u00a0\n Formerly special statutes applicable to particular districts indicated the division in which criminal proceedings should be had, but the statutes were not uniform. Some provided that crimes and offenses should be 'indictable' and triable only in the division where committed, or that all criminal proceedings should 'be brought' and had in such division. But the greater number, in varying terms, required that the trial be in that division, unless the accused consented to its being in another. In districts where the latter were in force, it was common to impanel a grand jury from the district at large, to charge such grand jury with the investigation and presentment of offenses committed in any part of the district, and when indictments were returned to remit them for trial and other proceedings to the divisions wherein the offenses were committed, save as the defendant assented to a disposal in another division. The practice is illustrated in Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263, 297\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 617, and Rosencrans v. United States, \n165 U.S. 257\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 302. The general provision in section 53 here relied on superseded the special statutes. It obviously is less restrictive in its terms than some of them were; and the prevailing practice under it has been like that theretofore followed in districts where the less restrictive provisions were in force. See Biggerstaff v. United States (C. C. A.) 260 Fed. 926; United States v. Chennault (D. C.) 230 Fed. 942.\n The contention is that the word 'prosecution' in the general provision includes the finding and return of an indictment. That the word sometimes is used as including them must be conceded. But there are also relations in which it comprehends only the proceedings had after the indictment is returned. Here we think it is used with the latter signification. It appears twice in the provision, doubtless with the same meaning. The first time is in the clause directing that 'all prosecutions' be had in the division where the offense was committed, and the second \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 237]\n\u00a0\n is in the clause permitting the court or judge, at the instance of the defendant, to order 'the cause to be transferred for prosecution' to another division. The connection in which it appears the second time shows that it refers to the proceedings after the indictment is found and returned; that is to say, after there is a cause susceptible of being transferred. Besides, had Congress intended to put an end to the prevailing practice of impaneling a grand jury for the entire district at a session in some division and of remitting the indictments to the several divisions in which the offenses were committed, unless the accused elected otherwise, it is but reasonable that that intention would have been expressed in apt terms, such as were used in some of the exceptional special statutes. That practice was attended with real advantages which should not be lightly regarded as put aside. In many divisions only one term is held in a year. If persons arrested and committed for offenses in those divisions were required to await the action of a grand jury impaneled there, periods of almost a year must elapse in many instances before a trial could be had or an opportunity given for entering a plea of guilty and receiving sentence.\n In our opinion the real purpose of the provision, that which best comports with its terms when taken in the light of the circumstances in which it was enacted, is to require, where a district contains more than one division, that the trial be had in the division where the offense was committed, unless the accused consents to be tried in another. The Circuit Court of Appeals so held in a well considered opinion in Biggerstaff v. United States, supra. The only decision the other way, of which we are advised, was by the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in United States v. Chennault, supra, and that court receded from that decision in the cases now before us. \n\n[265 U.S. 224, 238]\n\u00a0\n The appellant relies on Post v. United States, \n161 U.S. 583\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 611, as making for the contrary conclusion. But it does not do so. The case turned on a special statute, now superseded, declaring that 'all criminal proceedings' for offenses in the district of Minnesota 'shall be brought, had and prosecuted' in the division in which the same were committed. The difference between that special direction and the general one now before us is so marked that further comment is not required.\n Other objections to the removal are urged, but those we have discussed and overruled are all that can with any propriety be regarded as open to consideration on these appeals.\n A survey of the records before us shows that the resistance to removal has been unreasonably protracted. The mandate in these cases will issue forthwith and will embody an order requiring under the bail given on the appeals in Nos. 341 and 342 and under that given on the granting of the writ of certiorari in No. 705, that Salinger surrender himself into the custody of the marshal for the Eastern district of Louisiana, at New Orleans, within 10 days from the day the mandate bears date preparatory to a removal under the warrant heretofore issued by the District Judge of that district, or, in the alternative, that he surrender himself within such 10 days into the custody of the marshal for the district of South Dakota at some place within that district, to be dealt with according to law.\n Judgments in Nos. 341 and 342 affirmed.\n Judgment in No. 705 reversed. \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSANGUINETTI v. U S(1924)\nNo. 130\nArgued: January 3, 1924Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Benjamin Carter, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The main portion of the city of Stockton, Cal., and the adjacent territory lie between the Calaveras river and the Mormon slough, both flowing in a general southwesterly direction. The streams are several miles apart, and the intervening area, including appellant's land, has always been subject to inundation by overflow therefrom, as well as by reason of periodic heavy rainfall. During periods of high water sediment was deposited in large quantities in the navigable channel, intefering with navigation and entailing annual expenditures for dredging. \n\n[264 U.S. 146, 147]\n\u00a0\n In view of this condition, Congress, in 1902, authorized the construction above the city of a connecting canal, by means of which the waters of Mormon slough were diverted into the Calaveras river. Act June 13, 1902, 32 Stat. 368, c. 1079. The canal was constructed in accordance with plans prepared by government engineers, after investigation, upon a right of way procured by the state of California and conveyed to the United States. A diversion dam was placed in the slough, immediately below the intake of the canal. The excavated material was put on the lower side of the canal, making a levee, of which the dam was practically a continuation; but that this was not done with a view of casting flood waters upon the upper lands is apparent, since the engineers believed the capacity of the canal would prove sufficient under all circumstances. It was evidently the most convenient method of disposing of the material, and also it may have contributed to strengthen the lower bank against erosion. The canal was completed in 1910. In January, 1911, there was a flood of unprecedented severity, and there were recurrent floods of less magnitude in subsequent years, except in 1912 and 1913. The capacity of the canal proved insufficient to carry away the flood waters, which overflowed the lands of appellant, lying above the canal, damaging and destroying crops and trees, and injuring to some extent the land itself. Appellant brought suit against the government to recover damages upon the alleged theory of a taking of the property thus overflowed. The land would have been flooded if the canal had not been constructed, but to what extent does not appear. None of the land of appellant was permanently flooded, nor was it overflowed for such a length of time in any year as to prevent its use for agricultural purposes. It was not shown, either directly or inferentially, that the government or any of its officers, in the preparation of the plans or in the construction of the canal, had any intention to thereby flood any of the \n\n[264 U.S. 146, 148]\n\u00a0\n land here involved, or had any reason to expect that such result would follow. That the carrying capacity of the canal was insufficient during periods of very heavy rains and extremely high water was due to lack of accurate information in respect of the conditions to be met at such times. The engineers who made the examination and recommended the plans determined, upon the information which they had, that the canal would have a capacity considerably in excess of the requirements in this respect.\n The Court of Claims concluded that none of the land here involved had been taken, within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, and that therefore no recovery could be had upon the theory of an implied contract, but that the liability sought to be enforced was one sounding in tort, of which the court had no jurisdiction. Accordingly the petition was dismissed.\n Beginning with Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, this court has had frequent occasion to consider the question now presented. In that case, by authority of the state of Wisconsin, a dam was constructed across the Fox river, which had the effect of raising the ordinary water level and overflowing plaintiff's land continuously from the time of the completion of the dam in 1861 to the beginning of the action in 1867, resulting in an almost complete destruction of the value of the property. It was held that this constituted a taking in the constitutional sense, and the rule was laid down (13 Wall. 181):\n'That where real estate is actually invaded by superinduced additions of water, earth, sand, or other material, or by having any artificial structure placed on it, so as to effectually destroy or impair its usefulness, it is a taking.'\n\n In United States v. Lynah, \n188 U.S. 445\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 349, a dam had been constructed by the United States in such manner as to hinder the natural flow of a stream and, as a necessary result, to raise the level of its waters and overflow the land of plaintiff to such an extent as to cause a total \n\n[264 U.S. 146, 149]\n\u00a0\n destruction of its value. It was impossible to remove this overflow of water and the property, in consequence, had become an irreclaimable bog, unfit for any agricultural use. It was held that the property had been taken and that the government was liable for just compensation, upon payment of which the title and right of possession would pass.\n In United States v. Cress, \n243 U.S. 316\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 380, the government by means of a lock and dam, had raised the water of the Cumberland river above its natural level, so that lands not normally invaded were subjected permanently to frequent overflows, impairing them to the extent of one-half their value. A like improvement had raised the waters of the Kentucky river in the same manner, so as to end the usefulness of a mill by destroying the head of water necessary to run it. The findings made it plain that it was not a case of temporary overflow or of consequential injury but a condition of 'permanent liability to intermittent but inevitably recurring overflows' and it was held that such overflowing was a direct invasion, amounting to a taking.\n Under these decisions and those hereafter cited, in order to create an enforceable liability against the government, it is at least necessary that the overflow be the direct result of the structure, and constitute an actual, permanent invasion of the land, amounting to an appropriation of and not merely an injury to the property. These conditions are not met in the present case. Prior to the construction of the canal the land had been subject to the same periodical overflow. If the amount or severity thereof was increased by reason of the canal, the extent of the increase is purely conjectural. Appellant was not ousted, nor was his customary use of the land prevented, unless for short periods of time. If there was any permanent impairment of value, the extent of it does not appear. It was not shown that the overflow was the \n\n[264 U.S. 146, 150]\n\u00a0\n direct or necessary result of the structure; nor that it was within the contemplation of or reasonably to be anticipated by the government. If the case were one against a private individual, his liability, if any, would be in tort. There is no remedy in such case against the United States. Keokuk Bridge Co. v. United States, \n260 U.S. 125\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 37.\n The most that can be said is that there was probably some increased flooding due to the canal and that a greater injury may have resulted than otherwise would have been the case. But this and all other matters aside, the injury was in its nature indirect and consequential, for which no implied obligation on the part of the government can arise. See Gibson v. United States, \n166 U.S. 269\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 578; Bedford v. United States, \n192 U.S. 217\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 238; Transportation Co. v. Chicago, \n99 U.S. 635\n; Jackson v.

U S(1924)\nNo. 13\nArgued: October 6, 1924Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Jesse C. Adkins, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On April 30, 1918, appellant entered into a contract with the United States by which, among other things, it agreed to make and deliver 440,000 magazines for Lewis machine \n\n[266 U.S. 217, 218]\n\u00a0\n guns, for which the United States agreed to pay $4.24 each. After 24,247 of the magazines had been delivered, the Chief of Ordnance requested appellant in the public interest immediately to suspend operations under the contract to the extent of 298,000 magazines. Written notice containing this request was sent to the Rochester district claims board for delivery to appellant, to whom its purport was communicated by the board. Thereupon appellant entered into verbal negotiations with an official of the board, with the result that an understanding was arrived at between them to the effect that the requested suspension should operate to the extent of 142, 000 magazines, instead of 298,000, as stated in the notice. The negotiations were exclusively with the claims board. No reply was made by appellant to the Chief of Ordnance, and it does not appear that the Ordnance Office was informed of the arrangement until long afterwards. Appellant, following this arrangement, continued to deliver magazines until May, 1919, at which time there had been delivered 298,000, leaving undelivered 142,000, under the terms of the original contract. Appellant thereafter neither requested to be allowed to furnish nor attempted to furnish this remaining number.\n In addition to the contract for the magazines, appellant had a large number of other contracts with the government for furnishing various sorts of munitions and supplies, and had numerous accounts relating thereto. It was therefore anxious to close this contract on its books, and especially so because there was some discussion going on among the ordnance officials in respect of the suspension request, and a possibility that the change agreed upon between the board (which was without authority) and the appellant might be challenged, and the magazines in excess of 142,000 charged against appellant as having been improvidently accepted and paid for. Appellant, accordingly, wrote to the secretary of the claims board, \n\n[266 U.S. 217, 219]\n\u00a0\n asking him to immediately arrange with the proper officer at Washington for a revised suspension request to terminate the contract in respect of the 142,000 undelivered magazines only, and expressly promising that, upon receipt of such request, appellant would 'immediately accept it, without making claim for any portion of the 142,000 magazines so suspended.'\n Appellant thereafter persistently and repeatedly urged that the officials of the Ordnance Office revise the suspension request by an order authorizing the delivery of the 298,000 magazines. Finally, on August 20, 1919, appellant again wrote, and, after referring to the fact that 142,000 magazines remained undelivered under the contract, said:\n'As we have received and accepted no suspension request for this number, it will be appreciated if you will have forthcoming suspension request for our acceptance in termination of this contract.\n\n'Some time ago we received verbal instruction of the Rochester district office to discontinue the manufacture of these magazines, as they were not wanted. So that there will be no misunderstanding, we are anxious to receive and accept suspension request; otherwise the contract will remain open on our books.'\n\n Following this letter, a verbal understanding was reached between appellant and an officer representing the government, by which appellant agreed to abandon and settle all claims, controversies, and disputed points growing out of contract 48-A if the officer would secure a revision of the suspension request, so as to allow the delivery of 298,000 magazines, instead of 142,000. Thereupon a new suspension request was issued by direction of the Chief of Ordnance, in consummation of this last agreement. Subsequently appellant acknowledged receipt of the revised request, saying that it had suspended work in accordance therewith, 'reserving, however, all its rights \n\n[266 U.S. 217, 220]\n\u00a0\n against the United States government ... for failure ... to perform all the provisions of the contract known as No. C.M.G. 48-A and especially its right to recover all the profits which it would have made had it been permitted to complete said contract.'\n Thereafter appellant several times inquired of the Chief of Ordnance as to the intention of the government respecting the delivery of the remaining 142,000 magazines, or the payment of prospective profits on account of its refusal to receive them, to which that officer replied that the government would not accept delivery, and that he was not authorized to pay anticipated profits. Thereupon appellant brought this suit to recover its anticipated profits.\n The Court of Claims rendered judgment in favor of the United States and dismissed the petition.\n The bare recital of the facts practically disposes of the case. From them it appears that appellant not only acceded to the elimination of 142, 000 magazines from the obligations of the contract, but made persistent and repeated efforts to secure from the Ordnance Office a change in the original notice, so as to include that number, instead of 298,000, expressly agreeing that if this were done it would abandon and settle all claims, controversies, and disputed points growing out of the contract. The government, through its authorized officials, accepted this proposal and the arrangement became fixed and binding. A good deal is said by appellant to the effect that this agreement was without consideration, but we need not stop to review the contention. It is enough to say that the parties to a contract may release themselves, in whole or in part, from its obligations, so far as they remain executory, by mutal agreement, without fresh consideration. The release of one is sufficient consideration for the release of the other. If authority for a rule so elementary be required, see, for example, Hanson v. Witten berg, \n\n[266 U.S. 217, 221]\n\u00a0\n 205 Mass. 319, 326, 91 N. E. 383; Collyer v. Moulton, 9 R. I. 90, 92, 98 Am. Dec. 370; McCreery et al. v. Day et al., 119 N. Y. 1, 7, 23 N. E. 198, 6 L. R. A. 503, 16 Am. St. Rep. 793; Dreifus, Block & Co. v. Salvage Co., 194 Pa. 475, 486, 45 A. 370, 75 Am. St. Rep. 704.\n It is true that, after receiving the revised notice, appellant assumed to reserve its right 'to recover all profits which it would have made if it had been permitted to complete said contract.' The rescission of the contract in so far as it was executory-that is, in respect of the 142,000 magazines-however, had been consummated by the government's acceptance of appellant's proposal. The attempted reservation came too late. Either it was a mere afterthought, or there was a concealment of purpose, on the part of appellant during the negotiations, amounting to bad faith. Whether the agreement was made reluctantly, or appellant got the worst of the bargain, are matters unnecessary to be considered. It is enough that, without fraud or coercion, it did agree.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSILBERSCHEIN v. U S(1924)\nNo. 66\nArgued: October 13, 1924Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 221, 222]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Rowland W. Fixel, of Detroit, Mich., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ of error brings here for determination the question whether the United States may be sued under subdivision 20,  24, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991), upon a claim for compensation arising under section 300 of the War Risk Insurance Act, as amended by section 10, c. 104, 40 Stat. 609, 611 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  514qqq), and subsequent acts, and, if so, under what circumstances such suit may be maintained. That section, so far as necessary to be stated, provides that compensation shall be paid to any enlisted man for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty when employed in active military service. The statute fixes a scale of monthly payments, dependent upon the extent of the disability. See section 11, c. 16, 41 Stat. 371, 373 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  514r). The administration of the original act was committed to the Director of the War Insurance Bureau (section 13, c. 105, 40 Stat. 399, [Comp. Stat. Ann. Supp. 1919,  514kk]) and so remained until the creation of the Veterans' Bureau by the Act of August 9, 1921, c. 57, 42 Stat. 147 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  967 1\/4 et seq.), when the authority was developed upon \n\n[266 U.S. 221, 223]\n\u00a0\n the Director of that Bureau. The official, in each instance, was directed to administer, execute and enforce the provisions of the act, with authority to makes rules and regulations not inconsistent therewith necessary or appropriate to carry out its purposes and 'decide all questions arising under this act,' except as otherwise provided therein. See section 2 of the 1921 Act, 42 Stat. 148 (Comp. Stat. Ann. Supp. 1923,  967 1\/4 aa).\n An examination of the original act and the various amendatory acts fails to disclose, so far as this question is concerned, any exception to or limitation upon the authority of the Director. There is no provision therein expressly granting the right to maintain any suit against the United States in respect of claims for such compensation.\n The original act of 1917 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  514a et seq.) and subsequent amendatory acts conferred upon the Bureau the authority to revise an award at any time, in accordance with the facts found, and to end, diminish or increase compensation previously awarded. Section 305, c. 105, 40 Stat. 398, 407; section 19, c. 57, 42 Stat. 154 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  514rrrr).\n The court below, after a very full review, dismissed the petition, holding that it was the evident intention of Congress to confer upon the Director full and exclusive authority to decide all questions arising under the act, in so far as they involved the exercise of executive duties and required the determination of disputed questions of fact, and to the extent indicated, to make his decision final and not reviewable by the courts. 285 F. 397; 280 F. 917.\n Plaintiff in error was in the military service as an enlisted man from December 9, 1917, until February 8, 1918, when he was discharged on account of physical disability. He was, at first, awarded compensation as for a total temporary disability, which was subsequently reduced to 20 per cent. as for a temporary partial disability (section 11, c. 16, 41 Stat. 371, 373), and finally taken away altogether on and after March 18, 1921, on the ground that the disability had ceased to be compensable. \n\n[266 U.S. 221, 224]\n\u00a0\n The petition alleged that the decision of the Director was arbitrary, unjust and unlawful, constituted a usurpation of power, was 'contrary to the proofs, if any,' and 'contrary to the weight of evidence on file in petitioner's case.' The action of the Director was alleged to be arbitrary:\n\n\n (1)\n Because after allowing compensation he discontinued it, although petitioner's physical condition had not improved but had become worse, being the same and resulting from the same causes for which compensation was originally allowed. But this is to say only that the Director had changed his mind, and, for aught that appears, that may have been based upon another and better view of the facts. Ample authority for his action is found in the provision already referred to, conferring power upon the Bureau to revise an award at any time and to end, diminish or increase the compensation.\n\n\n (2)\n Because he allowed for temporary partial disability when the undisputed evidence as found showed that petitioner was temporarily totally disabled. But, as the court below pointed out, it is not alleged that such evidence showed that such disability resulted from injury or disease caused or aggravated 'in the line of duty,' as provided by the statute.\n\n\n (3)\n Because petitioner was suffering from disabilities shown by entries in the Adjutant General's office not to exist at the time of his entering into the service, and there was no cause therefor other than petitioner's military service; that it was admitted by the Veterans' Bureau hospital authorities that since his discharge petitioner had been suffering from disabilities incurred in the military service, as evidenced by communications and letters attached to petition. These are all matters bearing, at most, upon the soundness of the Director's determination upon a matter properly submitted to his judgment, and fall far short of establishing its arbitrary character. \n\n[266 U.S. 221, 225]\n\u00a0\n The general allegations of the petition that the Director's decision was arbitrary, unjust and unlawful, and a usurpation of power, are merely legal conclusions. Clearly, the petition does not present a case where the facts are undisputed and the only conclusion properly to be drawn is one favorable to petitioner, or where the law was misconstrued, or where the action of the executive officer was arbitrary or capricious.\n We pass, without deciding, the question raised by the contention of the government that the claim is in fact for a pension and, hence, expressly excluded from judicial review by the terms of subdivision 20,  24, of the Judicial Code, and that, in any event, it is for a mere gratuity for which no suit can be maintained, even if the United States were otherwise suable, since, in any view of the matter, we conclude that no case is made for judicial intervention.\n The statute which creates the asserted right, commits to the Director of the Bureau the duty and authority of administering its provisions and deciding all questions arising under it; and in the light of the prior decisions of this court, we must hold that his decision of such questions is final and conclusive and not subject to judicial review, at least unless the decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence, or is wholly dependent upon a question of law or is seen to be clearly arbitrary or capricious.

This we must consider, although not raised by counsel. Stevirmac Oil Co. v. Dittman, \n245 \nU.S. 210, 214\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 116.\n This is a suit in equity brought in the District Court by a citizen of Oklahoma against a citizen of Kansas to enjoin the latter from enforcing certain judgments that he had recovered against the plaintiff in a State court-which were alleged to be unconscionable and void-and, incidentally, from further prosecuting a suit in the District Court that had been brought by him against a surety on a supersedeas bond given by the plaintiff in the course of the proceedings in the State court. The amount involved, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeds $3,000.\n The defendant moved to dismiss the suit on two grounds: 1st, for want of jurisdiction, because the diversity \n\n[264 U.S. 274, 276]\n\u00a0\n of citizenship had not existed at the time the judgments were rendered; and, 2d, for want of 'a valid cause of action in equity.' The District Judge, on consideration of this motion, handed down a memorandum in which- without passing upon the jurisdictional question raised by the motion-he said:\n'In examining the matter I am constrained to believe in so far as restraint of further proceedings in the courts of the state are concerned, the injunction prayed for in this suit is within the letter and spirit of the prohibition of Section 265 of the Judicial Code, ... and that the motion to dismiss interposed in this suit should be sustained.'\n\n A decree was thereupon entered dismissing the suit, at the costs of the plaintiff, 'for the reasons stated' in the memorandum. Thereafter the appeal to this court was allowed by another District Judge, sitting by assignment; his order allowing the appeal reciting that the decree dismissing the suit 'was made upon consideration solely of the question of the court's jurisdiction of the said action under the provisions of Section 265 of the Judicial Code.'\n Section 238 of the Judicial Code-reenacting a like provision in the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517 (Comp. St.  1215)-provides that appeals and writs of error may be taken from District Courts direct to this court in cases 'in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue,' in which case that question alone shall be certified from the court below for decision. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n We assume for present purposes that in matter of form the recital in the order allowing the appeal that the suit was dismissed 'upon consideration solely of the court's jurisdiction' of the action under Section 265 of the Code (Comp. St.  1242), is a sufficient certification of a jurisdictional question. See \n\n[264 U.S. 274, 277]\n\u00a0\n Excelsior Pipe Co. v. Bridge Co., \n185 \nU.S. 282, 285\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 681. Coming, however, to the matter of substance, it is clear that the suit was dismissed solely upon the ground that in the opinion of the District Judge the court was prohibited by Section 265 from granting the injunction sought by the bill. True it is that where a District Court dismisses a suit upon the specific ground of want of jurisdiction, this court, upon a sufficient certificate, acquires jurisdiction of a direct appeal, and, whatever the ground assigned by the District Court for the supposed want of jurisdiction, must determine whether or not that court had and should have exercised the jurisdiction thus denied. Excelsior Pipe Co. v. Bridge Co., supra, p. 285 (22 Sup. Ct. 681); The Ira M. Hedges, \n218 \nU.S. 264, 270\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 17, 20 Ann. Cas. 1235; Louisville & N. Railroad Co. v.

But where, as in the present case, a decree of the District Court does not purport to be based upon a question of its jurisdiction, a subsequent certificate characterizing the ground of the decision as one involving its jurisdiction, does not authorize this court to entertain the appeal unless the question certified presents an issue as to 'the jurisdiction of the court' within the meaning of section 238 of the Code. Smith v. McKay, \n161 \nU.S. 355, 357\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 490; O'Neal v. United States, \n190 \nU.S. 36, 38\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 776; Bien v. Robinson, \n208 \nU.S. 423, 427\n, 28 S. Sup.

Sup. Ct. 69.\n Does the dismissal of a suit in equity upon the ground that the court is prohibited by Section 265 of the Code from granting the relief sought by the bill, involve an issue as to 'the jurisdiction of the court' within the meaning of Section 238 of the Code?\n Under the latter section, as interpreted by repeated decisions of this court, the jurisdiction of the District Court is an issue only when its power to hear and determine the cause, as defined and limited by the Constitution or \n\n[264 U.S. 274, 278]\n\u00a0\n statutes of the United States, is in controversy, Smith v. McKay, supra, p. 358 (16 Sup. Ct. 490); Mexican Railway v. Eckman, \n187 U.S. 429\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 211; O'Neal v. United States, supra, p. 37 (23 Sup. Ct. 776); United States v. Congress Construction Co., \n222 \nU.S. 199, 201\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 44; The Pesaro, \n255 \nU.S. 216, 218\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 308; that is, shortly stated, when 'its power to entertain the suit under the laws of the United States' is in issue. Louisville & N. Railroad Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., supra, p. 371 (34 Sup. Ct. 810).\n Where a District Court is vested with jurisdiction of a cause-as where diversity of citizenship exists and the matter in controversy is of the requisite value-the question whether as a court of equity it has power to entertain the suit and afford the plaintiff equitable relief, does not present a jurisdictional issue. Bien v. Robinson, supra, p. 427 (28 Sup. Ct. 379). Such an issue is not presented by the question whether there is want of equity in the bill, Smith v. McKay, supra, p. 353 (16 Sup. Ct. 490 ); Building Association v. Price, \n169 \nU.S. 45, 46\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 251; World's Columbian Exposition v. United States (C. C. A.) 56 Fed. 654, 6 C. C. A. 58, 666; as whether its allegations are sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to the equitable relief sought, Louisville & N. Railroad Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., supra, p. 372 (34 Sup. Ct. 810); DeRees v. Costaguta, supra, p. 173 (41 Sup. Ct. 69) or whether it is not cognizable in equity because of a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law, Smith v. McKay, supra, p. 356 (16 Sup. Ct. 490); Shepard v. Adams, \n168 \nU.S. 618, 622\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 214; Illinois Railroad v. Adams, \n180 \nU.S. 28, 34\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 251.\n So the question whether, in a suit in equity, the plaintiff is prevented by Section 265 of the Code from obtaining an injunction staying proceedings in a State court, does not present an issue as to 'the jurisdiction' of the District Court. This Section-re-enacting Section 720 of the Revised Statutes-provides that, except in bankruptcy cases, the 'writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a State.' It is not a jurisdictional statute. It neither confers jurisdiction upon the District Courts nor takes away the jurisdiction otherwise specifically conferred upon them \n\n[264 U.S. 274, 279]\n\u00a0\n by the Federal statutes. \n2\n It merely limits their general equity powers in respect to the granting of a particular form of equitable relief; that is, it prevents them from granting relief by way of injunction in the cases included within its inhibitions. In short, it goes merely to the question of equity in the particular bill. See Simon v. Southern Railway, \n236 \nU.S. 115, 116\n, 112 S.-124, 35 Sup. Ct. 255; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 \nU.S. 175, 185\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 93; Public Service Co. v. Corboy,3 supra, p. 160 (39 Sup. Ct. 440); National Surety Co. v. State Bank (C. C. A.) 120 Fed. 593, 604, 56 C. C. A. 657, 61 L. R. A. 394. This Section, as settled by repeated decisions of this court, does not prohibit in all cases injunctions staying proceedings in a State court. Such injunctions may be granted, consistently with its provisions, in several classes of cases. See Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, supra, at p. 183 (41 Sup. Ct. 93) in which many decisions on this question are collated and classified. Necessarily, therefore, in a suit in equity of which a District Court has jurisdiction under the Federal statutes, where the relief sought is an injunction against proceedings in a State court, it is the duty of the court to determine, under the allegations and proof, whether a case is made which entitles the plaintiff to the injunction sought, that is, whether the case presented is one in which such relief is prohibited by the statute or one in which it may \n\n[264 U.S. 274, 280]\n\u00a0\n nevertheless be granted. Marshall v. Holmes, \n141 \nU.S. 589, 601\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 62. Where the plaintiff has the undoubted right to invoke its Federal jurisdiction the court is bound to take the case and proceed to judgment. Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 234\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 79, 24 A. L. R. 1077. And when the court takes jurisdiction and determines that in the light of Section 265 of the Code it is either authorized or prevented from granting the injunction prayed, its decision, whether the relief sought be granted or denied, is plainly not a decision upon a jurisdictional issue but upon the question whether there is or is not equity in the particular bill; that is, a decision going to the merits of the controversy.\n In the present case the District Court, as shown by the memorandum and decree, did not decline to exercise jurisdiction. On the contrary, it took jurisdiction of the cause, and, determining, upon consideration of the bill, that it was prohibited by Section 265 from granting the relief sought, dismissed the bill; thereby, in effect, sustaining the ground of the motion relating to want of equity in the bill. This decision, not being upon a jurisdictional issue, but on the merits, was only reviewable by appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. De Rees v. Costaguta, supra, p. 173 (41 Sup. Ct. 69). The direct appeal to this court was therefore improvidently allowed.\n Prior to the Act of September 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1215A) this would have resulted in the dismissal of the appeal for want of jurisdiction here. Smith v. McKay, supra, p. 359 ( 16 Sup. Ct. 490); O'Neal v. United States, supra, p. 38 (23 Sup. Ct. 776); Excelsior Pipe Co. v. Bridge Co., supra, p. 285 (22 Sup. Ct. 681) De Rees v. Costaguta, supra, p. 174 (41 Sup. Ct. 69). That Act, however, amends the Judicial Code by adding Section 238(a), providing, inter alia, that an appeal taken to this court in a case wherein it should have been taken to a Circuit Court of Appeals shall not for such reason be dismissed, but shall be transferred to that court for determination as if the appeal had been duly taken to it. As this appeal involves a question upon \n\n[264 U.S. 274, 281]\n\u00a0\n the merits of the controversy which should have been taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit instead of to this court, it must, pursuant to the statute, be transferred to that court.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act of 1891 related to direct appeals and writs of error from the then existing circuit courts as well as district courts. Decisions under that Act as well as the Code are cited in this opinion without distinction in this respect. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Its language is similar to that in Section 267 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1244), providing that suits in equity 'shall not be sustained in any court of the United States in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at law,' which does not go to the jurisdiction of the court; and in marked contrast to the provision in Section 24 of the Code (Comp. St.  991) that no 'District Court shall have cognizance of any suit' to recover upon any chose in action in favor of an assignee, unless it might have been prosecuted in such court if no assignment had been made. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] In this case, as the decree had dismissed the bill 'for want of jurisdiction,' this court was required, under the direct appeal, to determine whether the District Court had the jurisdiction which it had denied; and its decree denying jurisdiction was reversed. \n\n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHEASTERN EXP CO. v.

The express company is a common carrier of freight of various kinds over certain lines of railroads in the state in both interstate and intrastate commerce. It commenced business May 1, 1921\n\n\n Section 21, chapter 104, provides as follows:\n'Express Companies.-On each express company intrastate commerce. It commenced business one point to another in this state $500.00 and $6. 00 per mile on all first class railroad tracks in this state over which the business is operated, and $3.00 per mile on all second or third class railroad tracks in this state over which the business is operated.'\n\n By section 73, chapter 104, it is provided that all persons or corporations liable for privilege taxes--\n'who shall fail to procure the license therefor before beginning the business taxed, or who shall fail to renew, during the month in which it is due, the license on a business on which he has theretofore paid a privilege tax, shall in each or either such instance be liable for double the amount of the tax, and it is hereby made the duty of the tax collector of the county in which such business is conducted to collect the amount, issue a separate license therefor, and to indorse across its face, the words: 'Collected as Damages.\" \n\n[264 U.S. 535, 537]\n\u00a0\n The express company did not pay any privilege tax before commencing business May 1, 1921, nor obtain the license which issues on such payment.\n\n Robertson, defendant in error, acting in his capacity of state revenue agent, made an assessment against the company for the sum of $4, 325.33 as the tax under section 21, chapter 104, and a like sum as damages under section 73.\n The company tendered the amount assessed as the tax, but declined to pay the amount assessed as damages. The tender was refused and this action was brought, resulting in the judgment we have indicated.\n There is agreement as to the railroads over which the express company carries express and the number of miles the express is carried, and it is agreed that it carries express over all of the railroad tracks, but intrastate express only from station to station in the state.\n It is also agreed that under the laws of Mississippi the Railroad Commission of the state on the first Monday of August, 1920, classified the railroads of the state according to their charters and the gross earnings of each, for the purpose of levying a privilege tax on the railroads, the classification being set out, for the year beginning the first Monday of August, 1920. The number of miles of track of each is given. No other or further classification of the railroads was made until August 1, 1921, when they were again classified.\n It is also agreed that no classification of the railroad tracks under the laws of the state of 1920, under section 21, chapter 104, nor otherwise, has ever been made by the Railroad Commission, with reference to the operation of the express company or of any other express company over the tracks; and it is agreed that the sum of $4,325.33 imposed, and for which the action was brought, was for the year beginning May 1, 1921, and ending May 1, 1922. \n\n[264 U.S. 535, 538]\n\u00a0\n The business done by the company for the six months beginning July 1, 1921, and ending December 1, 1921, is given.\n The court directed a verdict in the sum of $4,383.50, refusing to direct for the penalty. For that amount only was judgment entered.\n Robertson and the express company each prosecuted an appeal-Robertson to reverse so much of the judgment as denied his right to recover damages or penalty, that is, which limited his recovery to the taxes only; the express company to reverse so much of the judgment as was against it. Robertson succeeded in his appeal; the express company failed.\n The contention of the company is that the statute denies to the express company due process, in that (a) it is so vague, uncertain, and indefinite as to be void; (b) it provides no measure or standard by which to distinguish the railroads in connection with an express business, 'and no provision of law is elsewhere found by which it can be ascertained as to what are first class railroad tracks and second and third class railroad tracks in connection with an express business'; (c) although the Supreme Court of Mississippi has held that first, second, and third class railroads, referred to in section 21, are those required by section 45 to be classified by the Railroad Commission, and although the effect of holding may be to ingraft upon section 21 section 45, even assuming that the connection between the sections and their purposes be thus conclusively established by the decision of the Supreme Court of Mississippi, 'there still is found neither measure nor standard for classifying railroad trackage for the purpose of taxing the express business operated over such trackage, inasmuch as the classification of railroads under section 45, chapter 104, etc., is for the sole purpose 'of levying a privilege tax on railroads\"; (d) if the classification of railroads despite its purpose can be so extended, there is \n\n[264 U.S. 535, 539]\n\u00a0\n no provision for notice and hearing to express companies when the classification of railroads is made. $There is the further contention that plaintiff in error is denied the equal protection of the laws in that (a) damages in an amount equal to the privilege tax, are allowed against it because it failed to pay the privilege tax before entering business on May 1, 1921, while other express companies, as well as all other persons and corporations subject to privilege taxes already in business, are allowed 30 days after the privilege tax accrues annually within which to pay the same, and 'that the discrimination under the law in this respect is arbitrary and unwarranted by any sound reason or principle of distinction' ; (b) railroads are accorded the right to be heard upon the correctness of the classification made by the commission which governs the classification under the law for the purpose of levying privilege taxes upon them, while express companies are not accorded a hearing when the classification is made upon them, and are not allowed to present facts either as to the value of particular trackage relative to an express business, or which under the law governs the classification for the purpose of levying privilege taxes upon railroads.\n The Supreme Court of the state held adversely to all of these contentions and we think in correct estimate of them.\n If it can be conceded to the express company that the statute had vagueness, it was competent for the court to resolve it to clearness, which it did by an explanation of the laws and the relation of their provisions, and deduced therefrom their constitutionality and freedom from the objections urged against them. We are not disposed to an enumeration of the objections. They are somewhat involved. A prominent one is, and it is variously expressed, that the express company was not heard in the classification of railroads; it being insisted that between the latter fact and the express business there is intimate \n\n[264 U.S. 535, 540]\n\u00a0\n relation, and therefore the same right of hearing to the express company as to railroads. But the fact of the classification of railroads was one that preceded the express company, of which it was aware, and was an element in the estimate of the privilege that was to be granted, for over the railroads the privilege could only be exercised. There was no element of judicial inquiry. The tax was the condition of a privilege to carry on a business-might, indeed, be denominated a license, but call it privilege or license, it was a condition the state could impose, and, having the option to impose it, could fix its amount directly or by reference to a standard. Hagar v. Reclamation District, \n111 U.S. 701\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 663; Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 U.S. 576\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 372.\n The objection that the express company was not given a hearing upon the classification of railroads is made a basis for the contention that the express company is denied the equal protection of the laws. In specification of this it is said that railroads are entitled to be heard upon their classification, and therefore upon the condition upon which the amount of the privilege tax upon them depends, while a hearing is denied to express companies, when necessarily the classification is as intimate to and a condition of the tax upon them as upon the railroads. The Supreme Court of the state found reasons for the difference, and there is certainly a difference between railroads and express companies of themselves, and necessarily in their relations to their respective businesses, and, against the action of the state and the judgment of its courts, the difference cannot be regarded as not of legal consideration in the imposition of an excise upon the express companies.\n It is further urged that there is a discrimination offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment in the laws of Mississippi permitting damages against the express company in an amount equal to the privilege tax, because it failed to pay the tax before entering May 1, 1921, while \n\n[264 U.S. 535, 541]\n\u00a0\n other companies, persons, and corporations already in business are allowed 30 days after the taxes accrue annually within which to pay them. The Supreme Court of the state decided against the contention, and we think that there is difference enough in the situations to justify the difference in the provision and exempt it from the charge of unconstitutionality.\n The court thereupon reversed the judgment of the court below and rendered judgment in favor of Robertson for both the tax and damages sued for, and, under the practice of the court, entered judgment to that effect, with interest and costs.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHEASTERN EXP CO. v.

Robertson, State Revenue Agent, No. 201, \n264 U.S. 535\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 421, 68 L. Ed. --, just decided.\n It is a suit in equity which seeks to have the tax decreed 'illegal, void, and unenforceable.' An interlocutory injunction was petitioned, and the District Judge called to his assistance two other judges, in accordance with section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243), to hear the application. A preliminary restraining order was granted.\n The application for injunction, coming on subsequently to be heard, was denied, and from the order and decree denying it this appeal was granted and is prosecuted.\n The grounds of appeal and assignments of error are the same as in the other case, except as we shall notice, the difference being only in the nature of the suit and procedure -in this case, a bill in equity to enjoin the enforcement of the second year's tax; in that, grounds of defense against the collection of the first year's tax, the facts being stipulated. In this, they are alleged in the bill of complaint.\n In that case, all the grounds relied on in this case were decided adversely to the Express Company; that is, the tax was adjudged to be legal, and the judgment was affirmed by the opinion just delivered, and on the authority of that decree the decree in this case may be based.\n It may be well to observe, to avoid misunderstanding, that in the order and decree denying the interlocutory injunction the statute of Mississippi was held constitutional against the charge of violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and also as being a charge against article 1, section 8, clause 3, being the commerce clause, of the Constitution of the United States. The ruling in the latter respect is assailed and assigned as error in the record, but not in the argument, and we therefore do not discuss it. It will be observed, besides, that the tax imposed is on business done between stations in the state.

The opinion below is reported in 282 Fed. 837.\n The argument developed that the controverted question was whether the evidence sufficed to establish actual dedication of petitioner's property to public use-primarily a question of fact. That is not the ground upon which we granted the petition, and, if sufficiently developed, would not have moved us thereto.\n Heretofore we have pointed out the necessity for clear, definite, and complete disclosures concerning the controversy when applying for certiorari.

The opinion first cited states that during the 1915 term 154 petitions were presented, and suggests the probability of a largely increased number. During the last term (1922) petitions were filed in 420 causes.\n Obviously it is impossible for us critically to examine so many records before ruling upon applications, and we must rely very largely upon preliminary papers.

Answering, plaintiffs in error attacked the ordinance as arbitrary, unreasonable and subdiversive of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment; also because it conflicted with the federal Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp.

The facts relied upon to support these claims were specified.\n Having heard the cause upon complaint, answers and argument of counsel the trial court, 'being of the opinion that no issue of fact for trial by jury is raised upon the pleadings,' made findings of fact, declared the ordinance valid and directed compliance therewith. The railroads offered no evidence, but asked continuation of the cause until the next term and that no further proceedings should be taken until the issues of fact raised by the answers could be decided by a jury. This was denied and they appealed. The Supreme Court held refusal to continue the hearing and transfer the cause to the civil docket for trial by jury was not erroneous, and said that 'the judge was ready to hear and determine the action but the railroads failed to offer testimony or evidence of any kind whatever.'\n We are unable to find that plaintiffs in error have been deprived of any federal right. They had full opportunity to present evidence to support their contentions in the trial court, but offered none. Neither federal laws nor Constitution gave them the right to demand trial by jury when the local statutes and practice prescribed otherwise. The ordinary rule applies, and we accept the ruling of the Supreme Court as to the local law. First National Bank v. Weld County, \n264 \nU.S. 450, 454\n, 44 S.

D. Gresham, of Dallas, Tex., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought in the District Court by the Sovereign Camp Woodmen of the World, a fraternal society organized under the laws of Nebraska, against twenty-five of its members, all citizens of Texas. Federal jurisdiction was based upon the diversity of citizenship, and the matter in controversy, which it was averred, exceeded, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of three thousand dollars. Judicial Code,  24, subd. 1 (Comp. St.  991\n\n[266 U.S. 292, 1]\n\u00a0\n).\n The bill alleged, in substance, that the defendants had entered into an agreement and conspiracy to embarrass and attempt to ruin the Society; that pursuant to this agreement and conspiracy they endeavored at a meeting of the Head Camp of Texas to secure their election as delegates to a session of the Sovereign Camp at New York; that they were defeated and other persons were duly elected and certified to the Sovereign Camp; that \n\n[266 U.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n they contested the election and appealed to the Sovereign Camp, which decided that they had not been elected and were not entitled to be recognized as delegates or to any privileges or perquisites as such, and seated the delegates certified by the Head Camp; that under the constitution and by-laws of the Society this decision was final; that nevertheless, acting in concert and pursuant to their joint agreement and conspiracy, they had brought twenty-five separate actions at law against the Society in a local court of Texas to recover amounts ranging from $987. 00 to $1,170.00, which they severally claimed as per diem and mileage allowances and traveling expenses by reason of attending the Sovereign Camp as delegates,1 that in each of these suits the same cause of action was alleged, in identical language, and only one issue was involved in all of them;2 that there was no merit in the cause of action set up by the defendants and the suits were wholly without any foundation; that if the Society was compelled to defend each of these separate suits, it would be subjected to an enormous expense; and that its remedy at law was inadequate: wherefore it prayed that the defendants be enjoined from prosecuting their separate suits in the state court or endeavoring to collect in any other manner \n\n[266 U.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n any sums of money from the Society by reason of the matters alleged.\n The District Court, on motion of the defendants, dismissed the bill on the ground that the court was 'without jurisdiction' thereof; being of opinion that as jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship, the requisite jurisdictional amount was not present, since each of the defendants claimed in his suit in the state court an amount less than $3, 000, and that Section 265 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1242) also deprived the court of jurisdiction. 286 F. 734.\n As the bill was dismissed upon the specific ground of want of jurisdiction, the direct appeal to this Court was properly allowed. Judicial Code,  238; Smith v. Apple, \n264 \nU.S. 274, 277\n, 44 S. Ct. 311.\n\n 1. \nIt is the settled general rule, frequently applied by this Court is tax cases, that in a suit based on diversity of citizenship brought against several defendants to enjoin the collection of claims against the plaintiff which are separate and distinct-although depending for their validity upon a common origin-the test of jurisdiction is the amount of each separate claim, and not their aggregate amount. Walter v. Northeastern R. Co., \n147 \nU.S. 370, 372\n, 13 S. Ct. 348; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Walker, \n148 \nU.S. 391, 392\n, 13 S. Ct. 650; Fishback v. Telegraph Co., \n161 \nU.S. 96, 100\n, 16 S. Ct. 506; Citizens' Bank v. Cannon, \n166 \nU.S. 319, 322\n, 17 S. Ct. 89. An exception to this general rule was, however, recognized in McDaniel v. Traylor, \n196 \nU.S. 415, 427\n, 25 S. Ct. 369. There the heirs of one Hiram Evans, an intestate, brought suit in the circuit court against several defendants to enjoin the enforcement of claims that had been allowed as liens upon his real estate by orders of a probate court. Each claim was less than the requisite jurisdictional amount, but their aggregate exceeded that sum. The bill alleged that these claims were not debts of the intestate, but that the defendants had conspired and confederated with the ad \n\n[266 U.S. 292, 296]\n\u00a0\n ministrator to secure their payment out of the estate, and that the orders allowing them had been procured as the result of the conspiracy and the fraud practiced in pursuance thereof. This court reversed a decree of the circuit court dismissing the bill, on demurrer, for want of jurisdiction, and held that, on the face of the bill, the value of the matter in dispute was 'the aggregate amount of the claims fraudulently procured by the defendants acting in combination to be allowed in the Probate Court as claims against the estate.' In the opinion, after referring to the class of cases to which Walter v. Northeastern R. Co. belonged, the court said:\n'The case before us, however, is presented by the bill in an entirely different aspect. The case may be regarded as exceptional in its facts, and maybe disposed of without affecting former decisions. There is no dispute as to the amount of any particular claim. So far as the bill is concerned, if any one of the specified claims is good against the estate of Hiram Evans, then all are good. ... The matter in dispute is whether the lands ... can be sold to pay all the claims, in the aggregate, which the defendants, by combination and conspiracy, procured the Probate Court to allow against the estate of Hiram Evans. The essense of the suit is the alleged fraudulent combination and conspiracy to fasten upon that estate a liability for debts of John Evans, which were held by the defendants and which they, acting in combination, procured, in co-operation with James Evans, to be allowed as claims against the estate of Hiram Evans. By reason of that combination, resulting in the allowance of all those claims in the Probate Court, as expenses of administering the estate of Hiram Evans, the defendants have so tied their respective claims together as to make them, so far as the plaintiffs and the relief sought by them are concerned, one claim. The validity of all the claims depends upon the same facts. The lien on the lands which is asserted by each defendant \n\n[266 U.S. 292, 297]\n\u00a0\n has its origin as well in the combination to which all were parties as in the orders of the Probate Court which, in furtherance of that combination, were procedured by their joint action.'\n\n And in McDaniel v. Traylor, \n212 \nU.S. 428, 433\n, 29 S. Ct. 343, 344 ( 53 L. Ed. 584)-on a second appeal-in affirming a decree of the Circuit Court, made on return of the case, again dismissing the suit for want of jurisdiction, upon a finding that the allegation that the defendants had conspired in procuring the allowance of the claims, had not been established,3 it was said:\n'As we have already seen, it was the fraudulent combination and conspiracy which united the claims and made the aggregate of the claims the matter in dispute. By reason of that combination we decided the claims were 'so tied' together as to make them, 'so far as the plaintiffs and the relief sought by them are concerned, one claim.\"\n\n We find that under the allegations of the present bill the case comes fairly within the reason of the exception recognized in the McDaniel Cases. It is not only alleged that the defendants' claims are without foundation, but that they originated and are being prosecuted in the state court in pursuance of an agreement and conspiracy to embarrass and attempt to ruin the Society. There is no dispute as to the amount of any particular claim; and the validity of all of them depends upon the same issue. A conspiracy to prosecute, by concert of action, numerous baseless claims against the same person for the wrongful purpose of harassing and ruining him, partakes of the nature of a fraudulent conspiracy; and in a suit to enjoin \n\n[266 U.S. 292, 298]\n\u00a0\n them from being separately prosecuted, it must likewise be deemed to tie together such several claims as one claim for jurisdictional purposes, making their aggregate amount the value of the matter in controversy. We conclude, therefore, that, on the face of the bill, the District Court had jurisdiction of the suit by reason of the diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy.\n\n 2. \nThe jurisdiction thus acquired was not taken away by Section 265 of the Judicial Code, providing that, except in bankruptcy cases, 'the writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a state.' This section does not deprive a district court of the jurisdiction otherwise conferred by the federal statutes, but merely goes to the question of equity in the particular bill; making it the duty of the court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, to determine whether the specific case presented is one in which relief by injunction is prohibited by this section or may nevertheless be granted. Smith v. Apple, supra, p. 278, 44 S. Ct. 311.\n The decree is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The bill also alleged that one of the defendants in pursuance of the conspiracy originally brought suit in the state court against the Society for $28,882, alleging that the other defendants had transferred their claims to him, but that, upon notice of a petition for removal of the suit to the federal court, he had amended his original petition by striking out the averment of such assignments and limiting his claim to the amount claimed to be due him individually; and that thereafter the other defendants had brought their separate suits in the state court. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] It appears from the averments of the bill that the contention of the defendants was that by a secret exchange of ballot boxes forged and fraudulent votes were substituted for the true votes, and that they were elected at the original meeting after a minority of the delegates to the Head Camp had withdrawn to hold a pretended separate meeting. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] On the first appeal this Court had said (page 428 [25 S. Ct. 373]): 'If the plaintiffs do not prove such a combination and conspiracy, in respect, at least, of so many of the specified claims as in the aggregate will be of the required amount, then their suit must fail for want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court; for, in the absence of the alleged combination, the claim of each defendant must, according to our decisions, be regarded, for purposes of jurisdiction, as separate from all the others.' \n\n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPERRY OIL & GAS CO. v.

It was removed to the Federal District Court. That court, upon final hearing, entered a decree adjudging this instrument to be entirely null and void, and enjoining interference with the plaintiffs' possession of the premises. \n1\n This decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 282 Fed. 93. An appeal to this court was allowed by a Circuit Judge; and thereafter the appellants were also granted a writ of certiorari. \n261 U.S. 611\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 363.\n As the suit was removed to the Federal Court upon the ground that it arose under the laws of the United States,2 the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals was not made final by the provisions of Section 128 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1120) and Section 3 of the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1120a). Southern Pacific Co. v. Stewart, \n245 U.S. 562\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 203. Therefore the appeal was properly allowed under Section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218), and the writ of certiorari must be dismissed.\n Chisholm is an enrolled citizen of the Cherokee Nation, of the half- blood. Pursuant to the Cherokee Agreement-embodied in the Act of July 1, 1902, c. 1375, 32 \n\n[264 U.S. 488, 491]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 716-he was allotted two tracts of tribal lands; one of thirty acres designated as a 'homestead,' and another adjoining tract of fifty acres designated as 'surplus.' The alienation of both of these tracts was then restricted. In 1904, while unmarried, he executed an oil and gas lease for a term of fifteen years to the Creek & Indiana Development Company, covering, as an entirety, the eighty acres of his two allotments. It contained no provision for an extension or renewal. This lease was approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Chisholm married in 1911. In 1912, he and his wife moved upon the leased land, and have since that time occupied and claimed the entire eighty acres as a family homestead. Their residence is upon the 'homestead' thirty acres, the cultivated land and pasture extending upon the 'surplus' fifty acres. Neither owns any other land. In 1914-more than five years before the expiration of the lease-the lessee having found oil in paying quantities and completed the drilling of five wells, Chisholm executed a written instrument modifying the terms of the lease, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, so as to provide for an increased royalty and extend the lease as long as oil or gas should be found in paying quantities. This instrument-hereinafter called the extension lease-was approved by the Secretary of the Interior as to the 'homestead' thirty acres, which was still restricted land; but was neither approved nor disapproved by him as to the 'surplus' fifty acres, from which the restrictions had previously been removed. It was not, however, executed or joined in by his wife. Later in the same year the Development Company assigned the lease to the Sperry Oil & Gas Company; and that Company in 1918 assigned it to the Oklahoma Producing & Refining Corporation. The suit was commenced in 1919, about three months after the expiration of the term of the original lease. The lessees had then driven eleven wells on the leased premises \n\n[264 U.S. 488, 492]\n\u00a0\n and removed a large amount of oil. All royalty due under the leases at the original and increased rates had been paid by the lessees to Chisholm, or to the Indian agent for his benefit, and had been received by Chisholm; and such payments were continued to the time of the trial. His wife, however, received no part of this royalty, and did not learn that he had extended the original lease until shortly before the commencement of the suit.\n\n 1. \nThe ground of decision in both the lower courts was that the extension lease executed by Chisholm was void under the provisions of the Constitution and laws of Oklahoma relating to family homesteads because it was not joined in or consented to by his wife. The Constitution of Oklahoma provides that the rural homestead of any family in the State 'shall consist of not more than one hundred and sixty acres of land, ... in one or more parcels, to be selected by the owner,' and that 'nothing in the laws of the United States ... shall deprive any Indian or other allottee of the benefit of the homestead and exemption laws of the State.' Article 12,  1. These provisions are also contained in the state statutes. 1 Rev. Laws, 1910,  3343, p. 834. The family homestead of an Indian under the state law may include his tribal 'homestead' allotment as well as his tribal 'surplus' allotment. Hyde v. Ishmael, 42 Okl. 279, 143 Pac. 1044; Norton v. Kelley, 57 Okl. 222, 156 Pac. 1164; Belt v. Bush (Okl. Sup.) 176 Pac. 935. It is further provided by a statute originating in the territorial Session Laws of 1901, c. 10, p. 78, that 'no deed, mortgage or contract relating to the homestead,' except a lease for not exceeding one year, 'shall be valid unless in writing and subscribed by both husband and wife.' 1 Rev. Laws, 1910,  1143, p. 292. This applies to oil and gas leases covering the homestead. Carter Oil Co. v. Popp (Okl. Sup.) 174 Pac. 747; Rich v. Donaghey (Okl. Sup.) 177 Pac. 86, 3 A. L. R. 352; Treese v. Shoemaker, 80 Okl. 235, 195 Pac. 766. And, the interest of the husband and wife in \n\n[264 U.S. 488, 493]\n\u00a0\n the homestead not being severable, a lease or other contract relating to the homestead executed by the husband alone, may be set aside in an action brought by the husband and wife, unless she is estopped by her acts and conduct from asserting its invalidity.

Ishmael, supra; Carter Oil Co. v. Popp. supra.\n\n 2. \nIn our opinion, however, these provisions of the Constitution and laws of Oklahoma have no application to so much of the extension lease as covers the tribal 'homestead' of thirty acres.\n By the Oklahoma Enabling Act of June 16, 1906 c. 3335, 34 Stat. 267, it was provided that nothing in the Constitution of the State should be construed to limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulations respecting the Indians of the Territory, their lands, property or other rights, which it would otherwise have been competent to make. Section 1. The terms and conditions of the Enabling Act were accepted by the Constitutional Convention of Oklahoma by an 'irrevocable' ordinance, which was ratified with the Constitution itself. Coyle v. Oklahoma, \n221 \nU.S. 559, 564\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 688; Jefferson v. Winkler, 26 Okl. 653, 662, 110 Pac. 755; Molone v. Wamsley, 80 Okl. 181, 182, 195 Pac. 484. Congress was thus careful to preserve to the United States the authority over the Indians, their lands and property, which it possessed prior to the passage of the Enabling Act; retaining full power, which it had exercised from the earliest period, to deal with them as a dependent people and legislate concerning their property with a view to their protection; with the right to determine when, in their interest, the Government guardianship should cease, and plenary authority, notwithstanding the bestowal of Federal citizenship upon them, to place restrictions upon their right of alienating the lands allotted to them. Tiger v. \n\n[264 U.S. 488, 494]\n\u00a0\n Investment Co., \n221 \nU.S. 286, 309\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 578; Heckman v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 413, 416\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 424. And in all matters relating to the restrictions upon their allotted lands resort must be had to the Acts of Congress and to those Acts alone. Walker v. Brown, 43 Okl. 144, 141 Pac. 681; Collins Inv. Co. v. Beard, 46 Okl. 310, 148 Pac. 846; Wison v. Greer, 50 Okl. 387, 151 Pac. 629; Smith v. Williams, 78 Okl. 297, 190 Pac. 555; Molone v. Wamsley, supra.\n By the Act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312-which was in force when the extension lease was executed-it was provided that the 'homesteads' allotted to members of the Five Civilized Tribes of the half- blood should not be subject to alienation or incumbrance prior to April 26, 1931, unless such restrictions were removed by the Secretary of the Interior; but all restrictions upon the alienation or incumbrance of their other allotted lands were removed. Section 1. And it was further provided that 'leases of restricted lands for oil, gas or other mining purposes ... may be made, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, under rules and regulations provided by the Secretary of the Interior, and not otherwise.' Section 2. No other conditions were attached to the making of such leases.\n The authority thus given by the Act of Congress to an Indian of the half-blood to make an oil and gas lease upon his restricted 'homestead' allotment, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, cannot be limited or contravened by the provision of the Oklahoma law attaching to the execution of a lease upon the family homstead the condition that it must also be executed by his wife. This added requirement is inconsistent with the authority given the allottee by the Act of Congress to make such lease when approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and, it the wife does not consent to the lease, would entirely defeat the purpose of Congress. As applied to an oil and gas lease made by such an allottee upon his restricted 'homestead,' the provision of the Oklahoma \n\n[264 U.S. 488, 495]\n\u00a0\n law is hence invalid because of its repugnancy to the paramount Act of Congress. 'The power of Congress to impose restrictions on the right of Indian wards of the United States to alien or lease lands allotted to them in the division of the lands of their tribe is beyond question; and of course it is not competent for a State to enact or give effect to a local statute which disregards those restrictions or thwarts their purpose.' Bunch v. Cole, \n263 \nU.S. 250, 252\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 101, 102 (68 L. Ed.--).\n On the precise question of the effect of a state law which, if applicable , adds a condition to the exercise by an Indian allottee of rights granted him by an Act of Congress, the decision in Blanset v. Cardin, \n256 \nU.S. 319, 324\n, 326 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 519, 521 (65 L. Ed. 950) is controlling. There an Act of Congress gave Indians the right to dispose of their restricted allotments by will, in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior and subject to his approval. And it was held that a will made by an Indian woman, which was approved by the Secretary of the Interior, devising her restricted lands to others than her husband, was not invalidated by a provision of the Oklahoma Code that no married woman should bequeath more than two-thirds of her property away from her husband. The court said:\n'The Secretary of the Interior made regulations which were proper to the exercise of the power conferred upon him ... and it would seem that no comment is necessary to show that [the provision of the Oklahoma Code] is excluded from pertinence or operation. ... In a word, the Act of Congress is complete in its control and administration of the allotment and of all that is connected with or made necessary by it, and is antagonistic to any right or interest in the husband of an Indian woman in her allotment under the Oklahoma Code. ... Our conclusion is ... that it was the intention of Congress that this class of Indians should have the right to dispose of property by will under \n\n[264 U.S. 488, 496]\n\u00a0\n this act of Congress, free from restrictions on the part of the State as to the portions to be conveyed or as to the objects of the testator's bounty, provided such wills are in accordance with the regulations and meet the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n So it was the intention of Congress that Indian allottees of the half- blood should have the right to make oil and gas leases upon their restricted 'homestead' allotments, provided they are in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior and are approved by him.\n To the same effect are the decisions of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. In Walker v. Brown, supra, at page 146 (141 Pac. 681, 682), the court, in holding that a restrictive provision of an Oklahoma statute was not intended to apply to the will of an Indian woman devising her 'homestead' allotment under the authority given by the Acts of Congress, said:\n'This court has repeatedly held that acts of Congress supplant the laws of Oklahoma in relation to Indians; that certain state laws which are applicable to every other citizen are not in force as against or pertaining to the Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes, and that we have here, respecting some matters, two classes of citizens and two legislative sovereignties. ... It is obvious that, if the state law were given the construction contended for, it would have the effect of interfering with the policy of the Congress toward theIndians in the matter of the alienation of their allotted lands.'\n\n This case was approved and followed in Brock v. Keifer, 59 Okl. 5, 8 157 Pac. 88. And in Molone v. Wamsley, supra, at page 183 (195 Pac. 484, 486), it was said that it is 'beyond the power of the Legislature to enact any law invalidating or affecting' conveyances by Indian heirs 'made and approved in conformity with the acts of Congress.' And see Haddock v. Johnson, 80 Okl. 250, 194 Apc. 1077\n\n\n The Oklahoma statute derives no additional force as a restriction upon leases made by Indian allottees because it was in force as a territorial law at the time the Enabling \n\n[264 U.S. 488, 497]\n\u00a0\n Act was passed, and that Act provided that all laws in force in the Territory at the time of the admission of the State into the Union should be in force throughout the State 'except as modified or changed by this Act or by the Constitution of the State.' Section 21. Manifestly this provision related only to statutes affecting the citizens of the State generally and was not intended to authorize the application of such laws in contravention of the Acts passed by Congress in reference to the property of Indians under the power expressly reserved in the Enabling Act itself. Nor can it have that effect. See Truskett v. Closser, \n236 U.S. 223\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 385.\n Nor is the validity of the extension lease affected by the provision in the Oklahoma Constitution that nothing in the laws of the United States shall deprive any Indian or other allottee of the benefit of the homestead laws of the State. Whether or not this provision was intended to do more than to protect the allottees from the enforced seizure of their homesteads, it is sufficient to say that, whatever its purpose, it can have no more effect than the Oklahoma statute in giving validity to laws of the State repugnant to the reserved power of the United States in legislating in respect to the lands of Indians. Neither the Constitution of a State nor any act of its Legislature, whatever rights it may confer on Indians or withhold from them, can withdraw them from the operation of an act which Congress passes concerning them in the exercise of its paramount authority. thority. United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 419.\n It results that the extension lease executed by Chisholm in 1914, which was made under the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior and was approved by him as to the 'homestead' allotment of thirty acres, must be held to be valid as to such allotment.\n\n 3. \nAs to the fifty acres of the 'surplus' allotment, also included in the extension lease, an entirely different \n\n[264 U.S. 488, 498]\n\u00a0\n question is presented. All restrictions upon this land had been removed by the Act of 1908. When the extension lease was executed there was no limitation under the Acts of Congress upon Chisholm's right to alienate, encumber or lease this tract. It had become in all respects subject to his control, under the laws of the State, just as the property of other citizens. Jefferson v. Winkler, 26 Okl. 653, 664, 110 Pac. 755. All questions pertaining to its disposal fell under the scope and operation of those laws. Dickson v. Luck Land Co., \n242 \nU.S. 371, 375\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 167. And since his wife did not join in the execution of the extension lease, and there is nothing in her acts and conduct which estops her from asserting its invalidity, under the provisions of the Oklahoma statute, as interpreted and applied by the courts of the State, it must be held to be invalid as to the 'surplus' allotment; and it was to that extent properly set aside.\n The fact that the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior provided that if the restrictions were removed from a part of the land included in an oil and gas lease, the entire lease should continue subject to the approval and supervision of the Secretary of the Interior and all royalties thereunder should be paid to the Indian agent until the lessor and lessee made adequate arrangements to account for the oil and gas upon the restricted land separately from that upon the unrestricted, obviously adds nothing to the force of the extension lease in so far as it includes the fifty acres of 'surplus' lands, and can have no effect in relieving it as to such lands from the invalidity attaching by reason of the noncompliance with the laws of the State.\n And the extension lease being entirely invalid as to the 'surplus' fifty acres, the court it without authority to permit the lessee to continue to extract oil and gas therefrom although done in such manner as not to interfere with the plaintiff's use of the surface as a homestead. \n\n[264 U.S. 488, 499]\n\u00a0\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed as to so much of the extension lease as covers the fifty acres of the 'surplus' allotment, and reversed as to so much of said lease as covers the thirty acres of the 'homestead' allotment.\n Affirmed in part.\n Reversed in part. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Chisholm v.

CLOUD(1924)\nNo. 10\nArgued: October 2, 1923Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 352, 353]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. O. P. Wheelwright, of Minneapolis, Minn., for appellant.\n Mr. R. B. Brower, of St. Cloud, Minn., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the Public Service Company to enjoin the City from interfering with a proposed increase in the rates charged for fuel gas.\n The allegations of the bill, shortly stated, are: The Company is a public service corporation organized under the laws of Minnesota, and the City, a municipal corporation of that State. In 1905 the City by ordinance granted the Company's predecessor, its successors and assigns, the right to construct and maintain for thirty years works for the manufacture, distribution and sale of gas to the City and its inhabitants, and authorized it to sell fuel gas at a rate not exceeding $1.35 per thousand cubic feet. The grantee's rights were assigned to the Company in 1915, and since then it has been engaged in manufacturing and selling fuel gas under the ordinance. \n1\n Since 1917 the Company has sold fuel gas at the maximum rate of $1.35 prescribed by the ordinance. This rate has not yet yielded, and cannot yield any return on the value of the property devoted to the gas business, has resulted in a constant loss and steadily increasing operating deficit, is inadequate and confiscatory, and deprives the Company of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The City Commission has refused to entertain a petition to prescribe a rate yielding a reasonable return on the invested capital. To secure a fair and reasonable return, a rate of $ 3.39 per thousand cubic feet is necessary. The Company intends \n\n[265 U.S. 352, 355]\n\u00a0\n to increase its rate to that price. The City, however, has threatened to interfere with the collection of the proposed increased rate, and, unless restrained, will attempt to force the Company to continue to sell gas at the prescribed maximum rate, resulting in controversies and multiplicity of suits, and inflicting irreparable loss and injury upon the Company.\n The bill prays that the court adjudge that the maximum rate prescribed by the ordinance is confiscatory and violates the rights of the Company under the Fourteenth Amendment; and that the City be enjoined from interfering with the Company in raising the rate to $3.39, or attempting in any manner to force it to continue to sell gas at the ordinance rate.\n A motion by the Company for a preliminary injunction was denied. Thereafter, on motion of the City, the court dismissed the bill for want of equity, on the ground that there was a 'valid and subsisting contract between the City and the plaintiff Company governing the matter of a maximum rate for fuel gas.' The Company, by reason of the constitutional question involved, has appealed directly to this Court. Judicial Code,  238 (Comp. St.  1215); Columbus Railway Co. v. Columbus, \n249 U.S. 399\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 349, 6 A. L. R. 1648\n\n\n It has been long settled that a State may authorize a municipal corporation to establish by an inviolable contract the rates to be charged by a public service corporation for a definite term, not grossly unreasonable in time, and that the effect of such a contract is to suspend, during its life, the governmental power of fixing and regulating the rates. Home Telephone Co. v. Los Angeles, \n211 \nU.S. 265, 273\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 50, and cases there cited. And where a public service corporation and the municipality have power to contract as to rates, and exert that power by fixing the rates to govern during a particular time, the enforcement of such rates is controlled by the obligation resulting from the contract, and the question whether they are \n\n[265 U.S. 352, 356]\n\u00a0\n confiscatory is immaterial. Southern Iowa Elec. Co. v. Chariton, \n255 \nU.S. 539, 542\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 400, and cases there cited; Paducah v. Paducah Ry., \n261 \nU.S. 267, 273\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 335; Georgia Ry. Co. v. Decatur, \n262 \nU.S. 432, 438\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 613. The existence of a binding contract as to the maximum rate for fuel gas is therefore the controlling issue upon which this controversy depends. Its solution turns upon the question whether the City had power to contract on this subject by the ordinance of 1905; and, if so, whether the ordinance constituted such a contract.\n\n 1. \nWas the city authorized to enter into a contract as to the rate to be charged for fuel gas? Such authority must clearly and unmistakably appear. Home Telephone Co. v. Los Angeles, supra, page 273; Paducah v. Paducah Ry., supra, page 272. Whether it existed depends upon the laws of Minnesota in force at the time. The consolidated charter of the City ( Special Laws of 1889, c. 6, p. 131) provided as follows:\n The City 'shall be capable of contracting and being contracted with; and shall have all the powers possessed by municipal corporations at common law.' Subchapter 1,  1.\n'The common council in addition to all powers herein ... specifically mentioned, shall have full power and authority to make ... all such ordinances ... for the general welfare of the city and the inhabitants thereof, as they shall deem expedient.' Subchapter 4,  4.\n\n'The common council shall have full power by ordinance: ... To provide for and control the erection and operation of gas works, electric lights, or other works or material for lighting the streets and alleys, public grounds, and buildings of said city, and supplying light and power to said city and its inhabitants; and to grant the right to erect, maintain and operate such works, with all rights incident or pertaining thereto, to one or more private companies or corporations; ... to provide for and control the erection and operation of works for heating the public buildings of said city by \n\n[265 U.S. 352, 357]\n\u00a0\n steam, gas, or other means, and supplying light, heat, and power to the inhabitants of said city; to grant the right to erect such works and all incident rights to one or more private companies or corporations, and to control and regulate the erection and operation of such works: ... Provided, ... that the common council shall have authority to regulate and prescribe the fees and rates and charges of any and all companies hereinbefore mentioned.' Subchapter 4,  5, cl. 10.\n\n In construing and giving effect to these provisions of the charter we look to the decisions of the Supreme Court of the State. In Reed v. City of Anoka, 85 Minn. 294, 297, 298, 88 N. W. 981, 982 (1902) the city charter-likewise enacted in 1889-conferred upon the municipality the power 'to make and establish public pumps, wells, cisterns and hydrants, and to provide for and control the erection of waterworks for the supply of water for the city and its inhabitants.' The city, by ordinance entered into a contract with individuals for the construction and operation of a system of waterworks for such purposes, for a term of thirty-one years; the city agreeing to pay the grantees a specified sum per year for each hydrant, and restrictions and limitations being imposed as to the charges to be made by the grantees for water furnished the inhabitants. In a suit bought by taxpayers to enjoin the performance of this contract the court said, that there could be\n'no doubt but that these charter provisions confer upon the municipality authority to enter into contracts with individuals for the purpose of providing itself and its inhabitants with a supply of water. ... The authorities are very uniform that contracts of this nature are not within the legislative or governmental prerogatives of the municipality, but rather within its proprietary or business powers. Their purpose is not to govern the inhabitants, but to secure for them and for itself a private benefit. ... It was so held in ... [ \n\n[265 U.S. 352, 358]\n\u00a0\n ] Flynn v. Little Falls E. & W. Co., 74 Minn. 180. ... While this precise point of distinction was not made in that case, it is authority for the proposition that a municipality does not exercise its legislative functions in entering into contracts of this kind, but only its business or proprietary powers, to which the rules and principles of law applicable to contracts and transactions between individuals apply.'\n\n In City of St. Cloud v. Water Co., 88 Minn. 329, 332, 92 N. W. 1112, 1113 (1903), there was involved an ordinance passed by the present appellee in 1887, providing for the sale of the City's waterworks to certain persons and granting them the right to maintain the system for the period of thirty years and to furnish water to its inhabitants at certain specified rates; in consideration of which the grantees agreed to extend the system, to furnish water without charge for certain purposes, and to supply a specified amount of pure water for domestic purposes. The original charter of the City (Special Laws of 1868, c. 28, p. 144) made it capable of contracting, vested it with all the general powers possessed by municipal corporations at common law, and gave it the power of establishing and constructing public pumps, wells, cisterns, reservoirs and hydrants. In a suit by the City to set aside the contract entered into by the ordinance for failure of the grantees to furnish pure water in the stipulated quantities, the court said:\n'The obligations of the parties, as set out in the ordinance, constitute a contract. The city was enabled to enter into such obligation by virtue of its charter powers and the general laws of the state, and was endowed with the right to construct, or cause to be constructed, a water system for the benefit of its inhabitants, and had control of its streets, and could contract with reference to their use for the purpose of extending the system. ... The obligations thus entered into were mutual. Upon the one hand, the grantees, their successors and assigns, would be protected by the courts in the enjoyment of their \n\n[265 U.S. 352, 359]\n\u00a0\n rights-for instance, in the collection of the hydrant rentals; on the other hand, the courts of the state are open to the city to secure the enforcement of its rights. No serious question can arise as to the nature of the contract obligation. ...'\n\n In the light of these decisions of the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota we think it is clear that the City had authority, in 1905, under its charter and the laws of the State, to enter, by ordinance, into a contract, in its proprietary capacity and for the benefit of its inhabitants as well as itself, providing for the construction and operation of gas works for a period of thirty years and fixing the rates to be charged for gas sold to it and its inhabitants. This power existed, under the doctrine of the Reed Case, under the provisions of the charter giving the council the power to provide for the control and erection of gas works for the purpose of supplying the city and its inhabitants with heat and light. And we do not think that this contractual power was limited by the proviso that the council should have the right to 'regulate and prescribe' the rates and charges of the companies to which it might grant the right of constructing such works. It is true that, standing alone, this proviso, in the absence of any State decision to the contrary, would, under the construction given similar language in Home Telephone Co. v Los Angeles, supra, page 274, be regarded as conferring authority merely to exercise the governmental power of regulating rates, and not authority to enter into a contract. In that case, however, it was pointed out that there was no other provision of the charter authorizing the city to contract as to rates. And in the present case, as the other provisions of the charter gave the City authority so to contract, we must regard the proviso as merely an alternative provision; that is to say, we think that the City might either contract as to the rates, as an incident to its \n\n[265 U.S. 352, 360]\n\u00a0\n power of granting the right to construct and operate the public utility, or, if it did not exercise this power to contract, might thereafter 'regulate and prescribe' the rates in the exercise of the governmental authority conferred by the proviso. One power, however, is not destructive of the other. And where a municipality has both the power to contract as to rates and also the power to prescribe rates from time to time, if it exercises the power to contract, its power to regulate the rates during the period of the contract is thereby suspended, and the contract is binding. Paducah v. Paducah Ry., supra, pages 272, 273.\n We find nothing in conflict with our conclusion as to the City's authority to contract in section 33 of article 4 of the Minnesota Constitution, as amended in 1881, providing that:\n'The Legislature is prohibited from enacting any special or private laws in the following cases: ... 7th. For granting corporate powers or privileges, except to cities. ... 10th. For granting to any individual, association or corporation, except municipal, any special or exclusive privilege, immunity or franchise whatever.' General Laws 1881, p. 22, c. 3,  1.\n\n Clauses 7 and 10 read together plainly show that the prohibition against the granting of special or exclusive privileges by the Legislature does not apply to the granting of corporate powers or privileges to cities. It did not prohibit the Legislature from granting to the City by the consolidated charter of 1889, the power of contracting in its proprietary capacity in reference to the construction and operation of gas works. If it had had such an effect we cannot assume that it would have been overlooked by the Supreme Court of Minnesota in the Reed Case, in which no reference was made to this provision. It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider whether the provisions of the consolidated charter were authorized as an amendment to the original charter of \n\n[265 U.S. 352, 361]\n\u00a0\n 1862. See Brady v. Moulton, 61 Minn. 185, 63 N. W. 489. This constitutional provision is obviously entirely different from that involved in San Antonio v. Pub. Service Co., \n225 \nU.S. 547, 549\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 428, providing 'that no irrevocable or uncontrollable grant of special privileges or immunities shall be made, but all privileges and franchises granted by the Legislature, or created under its authority, shall be subject to the control thereof,' which was held to prevent a municipality, acting under the authority of the Legislature, from entering into a binding contract as to public service rates. The provision of the Minnesota Constitution makes no reference either to irrevocable or uncontrollable privileges, or to privileges created by a municipality acting under the authority of the Legislature and is, as we view it, merely a limitation upon the direct authority of the Legislature itself, to the extent that we have indicated.\n Nor do we find anything in the Laws of 1893, c. 74, p. 189 (General Statutes of 1913,  6137), in conflict with the conclusion which we have reached as to the power of the City to contract as to rates.\n\n 2. \nDid the ordinance constitute a contract fixing the maximum rate for gas? The intention to so contract must clearly and unmistakably appear. Paducah v. Paducah Ry., supra, page 272. The essential provisions of the ordinance are:\n The right and privilege is granted to construct and maintain for thirty years works and instrumentalities for the manufacture and distribution of electricity and gas. Section 1.\n The grantee is 'authorized' to manufacture and sell electricity and gas to the City and its inhabitants during such period. Section 2.\n The construction shall be done with the least practicable inconvenience to the public and individuals, and the 'grantee shall restore' all places where excavated to their original condition as far as practicable, and repair all damage done by such excavation. Section 3.\n In laying down pipes or \n\n[265 U.S. 352, 362]\n\u00a0\n erecting wires the grantee 'shall conform' to all reasonable regulations prescribed by the City. Section 4.\n'In consideration of the rights and privileges herein granted, the grantee hereby covenants and agrees that it will ... erect ... an efficient coal gas generating plant or system of ample capacity, and after the erection thereof will manufacture and offer for sale to the city and its inhabitants coal gas of at least fourteen candle power.' Section 5.\n\n'The grantee is authorized hereby to sell illuminating gas when the works therefor shall have been completed ... at the price of not to exceed' $1.85 per thousand cubic feet, 'and fuel gas at the rate of not to exceed' $1.35 per thousand cubic feet, and shall be at liberty to cut off the supply from any person not paying for a period of thirty days. Section 6.\n\n'The rights hereby granted are upon the express condition' that the City may purchase the electric and gas works of the grantee at specified intervals at the appraised value thereof, as determined by arbitrators to be chosen in a prescribed manner. Section 7.\n\n We think that the language of the ordinance, viewed in its entirety, clearly shows that it was the intention of the parties to enter into a contract for the construction of gas works and the manufacture and supply of gas to the City and its inhabitants during the thirty-year period, at the maximum rate prescribed. Although section 6 'authorizing' the sale of fuel gas at a price not exceeding $1.35, is not phrased in the language of an agreement-as the preceding section whereby the grantee 'agreed' to construct the plant and manufacture and sell gas to the City and its inhabitants-it is an essential part of the agreement. It is no less contractual than the provision in section 2 'authorizing' the grantee to manufacture and sell electricity and gas to the City and its inhabitants for thirty years-upon which the Company necessarily relies as the basis of the rights which it now \n\n[265 U.S. 352, 363]\n\u00a0\n claims and is seeking to enforce-or than that in section 7 giving the City the right to purchase the plant at an appraised value. The provision that the grantee is 'authorized' to sell fuel gas at a rate not exceeding $1.35, clearly implies that it shall not sell such gas at a higher rate. This is recognized by the bill itself. \n2\n In this respect the language has the same effect as that involved in Vicksburg v. Water Works Co., \n206 \nU.S. 496, 508\n, 516 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 762. There the ordinance granted the right to make such charges for the use of water as the grantees might determine, provided that they should not exceed fifty cents for each thousand gallons. This was held to constitute a binding contract fixing the maximum rates for water supplied to private consumers for the period of thirty years as set forth in the ordinance. So in Reed v. City of Anoka, supra, page 296, the ordinance imposed 'restrictions and limitations' upon the charges to be made; and in City of St. Cloud v. Water Co., supra, page 332, the ordinance 'gave the right' to furnish water at specified rates. And provisions in ordinances granting franchises to street railway companies that the rate of fare shall not be more than five cents, or that the grantee shall not charge a higher fare, are contractual. Detroit v. Street Ry., \n184 \nU.S. 368, 369\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 410; Cleveland v. City Ry., \n194 \nU.S. 517, 524\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 756; Cleveland v. Electric Ry., \n201 \nU.S. 529, 532\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 513; Georgia Ry. v. Decatur, supra, page 434. And the fact that here the parties intended to contract as to the gas rates is emphasized by the contrast between the provisions of the ordinance as to gas and electricity. While the grantee is authorized to maintain both gas and \n\n[265 U.S. 352, 364]\n\u00a0\n electric works for the period of thirty years, the ordinance specifies the maximum rates for gas but contains no provision as to the rates for electricity; the apparent purpose being to establish definitely by contract the maximum rates for gas but to leave the rates for electricity to be thereafter 'regulated and prescribed' by the council from time to time under the power given it by the proviso of the charter.\n\n 3. \nThe general provision of the Laws of 1919, c. 469, p. 603, authorizing cities of the class of the appellee 'through its city council or like governing body, by ordinance, to prescribe from time to time the rates which any public service corporation supplying gas or electric current for lighting or power purposes within said city may charge for such service,' has no application to the present case. Even if, in any aspect, it could otherwise be applicable, it is excluded from operating here by the specific proviso that it shall not be 'construed to impair the obligation of any contract or franchise provision now existing between any such city [council] and any such public service corporation.' Section 1. The City, clearly, could not avail itself of this statute to reduce the gas rates below the maximum prescribed in the contract of 1905; and the Company, conversely, cannot under it obtain higher rates. The contract is binding on both parties alike.\n The decree of the District Court is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the hearing or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The ordinance also granted the right to construct and maintain for the same period works for the manufacture and sale of electricity. The bill alleges that the gas and electric operations are conducted as distinct and separate departments, and that neither the Company nor its predecessor has ever sold gas except for fuel purposes, there being no demand for illuminating gas. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There are repeated references in the bill to this provision as fixing a maximum rate, thus: The 'maximum rate fixed for the price of gas in the ordinance,' section 36; and similar references to the 'maximum rate' in sections 39, 41, 42 and 44, cl. 1. \n\n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANDARD OIL CO.

Peck \n264 U.S. 52\n (1924) ]\n\n\n[264 U.S. 52, 55]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit for injunction, preliminary and perpetual, and accounting for profits and damages, upon the ground of infringement of letters patent No. 1,249,473, issued to William J. Peck, respondent.\n The bill is the usual one in patent cases. For answer to it the Standard Parts Company admits the use of the devices of the patent, and alleges they were constructed under the supervision of Peck, and under the terms and provisions of a contract dated August 23, 1915, by and between him and the Hess-Pontiac Spring & Axle Company, for and in behalf of the latter company and the Western Spring & Axle Company, and that it, the Standard Company, has succeeded to the entire assets, business, and good will of those other companies, including all of their rights in said contract and devices. And the Standard Company avers that Peck was fully compensated for his connection with the devices.\n As an offset and counterclaim, the Standard Company avers that all of the invention in the letters patent was made while Peck was in the employ of its predecessors in business, the Axle Companies above mentioned, and that he was so employed for a period of approximately one year and eight months, and paid while so employed a salary of $300 per month, and at the conclusion of the employment paid a bonus of $660.\n In answer to the counterclaim Peck admits the contract, but denies that it raised the contractual relations averred, or that it could be construed as passing any title to any inventions which might be incorporated in machinery built thereunder, and that neither the Axle Companies nor any person who might have purchased their assets, business, and good will could have acquired any right, title, or interest in the inventions. \n\n[264 U.S. 52, 56]\n\u00a0\n He admits the period of employment averred, and that he received the compensation averred, and that at the conclusion of his employment he received a bonus of $660, being the amount of $10 for each per cent. of reduction of direct labor cost as called for in said contract, the figures compiled by the Hess Company showing a reduction of 66 per cent. in direct labor.\n He admits that prior to and during the continuance and subsequent to the period of his employment he practiced as an attorney at law and solicitor of patents, but denies ever so acting for either the Hess Company or Western Company, and denies that he ever prepared or filed or executed any applications for either of the companies, or that any of such applications matured into the patent in suit.\n He denies the other allegations of the counterclaim.\n On the case as thus presented, Peck's testimony and some other testimony was taken, and certain exhibits introduced, and the judgment of the District Court was, after a review of the decisions of this and other courts, 'that the property in the invention belonged to the employer' (the Hess-Pontiac Spring & Axle Company), and that this property passed to the Standard Parts Company when it acquired the assets of the Axle Company, and that Peck holds the legal title in trust for the Standard Company. A decree was directed to be entered requiring an assignment of the legal title to the latter company.\n A motion for rehearing was made and denied, and on March 2, 1921, a formal decree was entered, adjudging the equities to be in favor of the Standard Company, and that Peck, within 10 days from the date of the decree, assign and transfer to the company the legal title to the letters patent and also transfer to it, the company, all other patents or pending applications for patents for inventions made by him, Peck, in connection with the processes and machinery developed \n\n[264 U.S. 52, 57]\n\u00a0\n in the performance of the agreement with the Axle Company.\n It was further adjudged that, if Peck failed to perform the decree, 'then and in that event' the 'decree shall have the same force and effect as such assignments and transfers would have had, if made.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree of the District Court, in so far as it decreed an assignment and transfer of the patent in suit and other patents and applications from Peck to the Standard Company.\n The court decreed a license to exist in the Standard Company in the machines, distinguishing, however, between the first six and the last four, in that in the first six title was in the Standard Company 'wholly free from the monopoly of the patent.' this being 'within the spirit and fairly within the letter of Rev. St.  4899' (Comp. St.  9445),1 and that the Pontiac Company had a right to sell these six machines to the Standard Company free from the patent. As to the last four, it was decided that the license to construct them was not assignable and could not pass to the Standard Company 'by the ordinary purchase and sale of a business.'\n The court concluded its opinion as follows:\n'Defendant [Standard Company] may be advised that it can abandon any further claim of license as to these four machines and contest the patent on its merits-a matter about which we express no opinion-and otherwise it is clearly open to defendant to make what effort it can to establish a license on the theory of estoppel by reason of Peck's knowledge of \n\n[264 U.S. 52, 58]\n\u00a0\n the building of these four machines without objection, if such knowledge and conduct occurred, or on the theory of a practical consolidation of the Pontiac Company with the present defendant, if their relationship has that character. Lane v. Locke, \n150 U.S. 193\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 78\n\n\n\n'The decree below is reversed, and the record remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.'\n\n The courts reached different rulings because of different readings of the cases. That of the District Court was that, while the mere fact that one is employed by another does not preclude him from making improvements in the machines with which he is connected, and obtaining patents therefor, as his individual property, yet, if he 'be employed to invent or devise such improvements, his patents therefor belong to his employer, since in making such improvements he is merely doing what he was hired to do.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this test. It conceded, however, that the deduction of the District Court was sustained by Solomons v. United States, \n137 U.S. 342\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 88, McAleer v. United States, \n150 U.S. 424\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 160, and Gill v. United States, \n160 U.S. 426\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 322, and, if correct, required the affirmance of the decree of the District Court. And the court admitted that there was no later declaration than that of those cases, nor any criticism of it. The court, nevertheless, dissented from it, subordinating it to other cases and reasoning, they establishing, it was considered, 'that an invention does not belong to the employer, merely by virtue of an employment contract, as well when that employment is to devise or improve a specific thing as when the employment is to devise improvements generally in the line of the employer's business,' and, considering further that Peck's employment was to devise or improve a specific thing, decided that his contract did not 'of its own force, convey to the employer the equitable title to the patentable inventions' which he 'might make in the course of its execution' but gave 'to the employer a license only.' \n\n[264 U.S. 52, 59]\n\u00a0\n It is going very far to say that the declaration of Solomons v. United States, repeated in subsequent cases, and apparently constituting their grounds of decision, may be put aside or underrated assigned the inconsequence of dicta. It might be said that there is persuasion in the repetition. It cannot be contended that the invention of a specific thing cannot be made the subject of a bargain and pass in execution of it. And such, we think, was the object and effect of Peck's contract with the Hess- Pontiac Spring & Axle Company. That company had a want in its business-a 'problem' is Peck's word-and he testified that 'Mr. Hess thought probably' that he (Peck) 'could be of some assistance to him [Hess] in working out' the 'problem,' and the 'thought' was natural. Hess had previous acquaintance with Peck, his inventive and other ability, and approached him, the result being the contract of August 23, 1915, the material parts of which are as follows:\n'This agreement witnesseth that second party is to devote his time to the development of a process and machinery for the production of the front spring now used on the product of the Ford Motor Company. First party is to pay second party for such services the sum of $300 per month. That should said process and machinery be finished at or before the expiration of four months from August 11, 1915, second party is to receive a bonus of $100 a month. That when finished second party is to receive a bonus of $10 for each per cent. of reduction from present direct labor, as disclosed by the books of the first party.'\n\n By the contract Peck engaged to 'devote his time to the development of a process and machinery,' and was to receive therefor a stated compensation. Whose property was the 'process and machinery' to be when developed? The answer would seem to be inevitable and resistless-of him who engaged the services and paid for them, they being his inducement and compensation, they \n\n[264 U.S. 52, 60]\n\u00a0\n being not for temporary use, but perpetual use, a provision for a business, a facility in it, and an asset of it, therefore contributing to it whether retained or sold-the vendee (in this case the Standard Company) paying for it and getting the rights the vendor had (in this case the Axle Company).\n Other meaning to the contract would confuse the relation of the parties to it-take from the Axle Company the inducement the company had to make it-take from the company the advantage of its exclusive use and subject the company to the rivalry of competitors. And yet such, we think, is the contention of Peck. He seems somewhat absorbing in his assertion of rights. He yields to the Axle Company a shop right only, free from the payment of royalty, but personal and temporary-not one that could be assigned or transferred. Peck therefore virtually asserts, though stimulated to services by the Hess Company and paid for them, doing nothing more than he was engaged to do and paid for doing, that the product of the services was so entirely his property that he might give as great a right to any member of the mechanical world as to the one who engaged him and paid him-a right to be used in competition with the one who engaged him and paid him.\n We cannot assent to this, nor even to the limitation the Court of Appeals put upon Peck's contention. We concur with the District Court, and therefore reverse the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Every person who purchases of the inventor, or discoverer, or with his knowledge and consent constructs any newly invented or discovered machine, or other patentable article, prior to the application by the inventor or discoverer for a patent, or who sells or uses one so constructed, shall have the right to use, and vend to others to be used, the specific thing so made or purchased, without liability therefor.' \n\n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF GA. v. CITY OF CHATTANOOGA(1924)\nNo. 21\nArgued: Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Sam E. Whitaker, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for defendant.[ State of Ga. v. City of Chattanooga \n264 U.S. 472\n (1924) ]\n\n\n[264 U.S. 472, 475]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Geo. M. Napier, of Atlanta, Ga., and Wm. L. Frierson, of Washington, D. C., for the State of Georgia.\n\n\n[264 U.S. 472, 478]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The state of Georgia obtained leave to file its bill of complaint in this court in a suit against the city of Chattanooga to enjoin it from appropriating for street purposes certain lands constituting a part of a railroad yard which that state owns in Chattanooga.\n The substance of the bill may be stated briefly: In 1837, Georgia undertook the construction of a railroad, known as the Western & Atlantic Railroad, extending from Atlanta to Chattanooga. The Legislature of Tennessee granted to Georgia the right to acquire the necessary right of way from the state line to Chattanooga and also land for terminal facilities. In 1852, Georgia purchased about 11 acres, then in the outskirts of that city, on which it located its railroad yard. The city has grown, and this tract of land is now near the business center. Georgia owns and formerly operated the railroad, but since 1870 it has been operated by lessee companies, and now the Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway Company operates it under a lease which will expire in 1969. \n\n[264 U.S. 472, 479]\n\u00a0\n For some years there has been a demand for extending one of the principal streets of the city through this railroad yard. Georgia denies the power of the city to condemn the necessary right of way for the street. It says that the right of Tennessee to condemn this land, or to authorize the city to condemn it, is not involved. But it asserts that the state has not authorized the city to condemn this land; that the city has been granted power of eminent domain only to the extent that it is granted by general statutes to corporations; that these statutes do not confer the power to appropriate land already devoted to public use; that such land can be taken only when specifically authorized; and that no power has been delegated to take property which the state has permitted a sister state to acquire. It is stated that the city officials have assumed by ordinance to open the street in such a way as will destroy the yard for railroad purposes, and that, prior to the filing of the bill in this case, the city commenced proceedings in the circuit court of Hamilton county, Tenn., to condemn the right of way for the proposed street extension, and in its petition named the state of Georgia and its lessee as defendants, and caused publication to be made for that state as a nonresident defendant. The bill alleges that Georgia has never consented to be sued in the courts of Tennessee, and prays for a decree enjoining the city from prosecuting the proceedings, and from interfering with Georgia or its lessee in the possession and use of the land, and decreeing that its land which the city seeks to appropriate is not subject to condemnation. The city moved to dismiss the bill. The motion must be granted.\n\n 1. \nThe power of Tennessee, or of Chattanooga as its grantee, to take land for a street, is not impaired by the fact that a sister state owns the land for railroad purposes. Having acquired land in another state for the purpose of using it in a private capacity, Georgia can claim no sovereign \n\n[264 U.S. 472, 480]\n\u00a0\n immunity or privilege in respect of its expropriation. The terms on which Tennessee gave Georgia permission to acquire and use the land and Georgia's acceptance amount to consent that Georgia may be made a party to condemnation proceedings.\n The power of eminent domain is an attribute of sovereignty, and inheres in every independent state. See Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, 406; United States v. Jones, \n109 \nU.S. 513, 518\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 346; Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 300\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 361; Cincinnati v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n223 \nU.S. 390, 404\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 267. The taking of private property for public use upon just compensation is so often necessary for the proper performance of governmental functions that the power is deemed to be essential to the life of the state. It cannot be surrendered, and, if attempted to be contracted away, it may be resumed at will. Pennsylvania Hospital v. Philadelphia, \n245 U.S. 20\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 35; Galveston Wharf Co. v. Galveston, \n260 U.S. 473\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 168. It is superior to property rights (Kohl v. United States, \n91 U.S. 367\n, 371), and extends to all property within the jurisdiction of the state-to lands already devoted to railway use, as well as to other lands within the state (United States v. Gettysburg Electric Ry., \n160 \nU.S. 668, 685\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 427; Adirondack Railway v. New York State, \n176 \nU.S. 335, 346\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 460). Land acquired by one state in another state is held subject to the laws of the latter and to all the incidents of private ownership. The proprietary right of the owning state does not restrict or modify the power of eminent domain of the state wherein the land is situated. See Burbank v. Fay, 65 N. Y. 57, 62; United States v. Railroad Bridge Co., 6 McLean, 517, 533, Fed. Cas. No. 16,114; United States v. Chicago. 7 How. 185, 194. Tennessee, by giving Georgia permission to construct a line of railroad from the state boundary to Chattanooga, did not surrender any of its territory, or give up any of its governmental power over the right of way and other lands to be acquired by Georgia \n\n[264 U.S. 472, 481]\n\u00a0\n for railroad purposes. The sovereignty of Georgia was not extended into Tennessee. Its enterprise in Tennessee is a private undertaking. It occupies the same position there as does a private corporation authorized to own and operate a railroad, and, as to that property, it cannot claim sovereign privilege or immunity. Bank of the United States v. Planters' Bank, 9 Wheat. 904, 907; Bank of Kentucky v. Wister, 2 Pet. 318, 323; Louisville Railroad Co. v. Letson, 2 How. 497, 550; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 463\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 737. Undoubtedly Tennessee has power to open roads and streets across the railroad land owned by Georgia.\n Chattanooga contends that Georgia has consented to be sued in the courts of Tennessee in respect of its railroad in that state. This claim is based upon the terms of the permission. Chapter 1, Laws Tenn. 1845-46, created the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad Company for the purpose of constructing and operating a line of railroad between Nashville and Chattanooga, and among other things made it capable in law of suing and being sued. Chapter 195, Laws Tenn. 1847-48, provides that:\n'All the rights, privileges and immunities with the same restrictions which are given and granted to the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad Company by the act [chapter 1 above mentioned] ... are, so far as they are applicable, hereby given to and conferred upon the state of Georgia, to be enjoyed and exercised by that state in the construction of that part of the Western & Atlantic Railroad lying in Hamilton county, Tennessee, and in the management of its business.'\n\n East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia Railway Co. v. Nashville, Chattanooga & Saint Louis Railway Co. and others, including the state of Georgia (Court of Chancery Appeals, Tennessee, 1897, 51 S. W. 202) was a suit concerning the administration of this railroad owned by Georgia in Tennessee. Page 211. Georgia insisted that, being \n\n[264 U.S. 472, 482]\n\u00a0\n a sovereign state, it could not be sued in Tennessee. Page 203. The court said that the act last above mentioned 'includes among the rights and restrictions the right to sue and be sued. This includes, namely, the courts of Tennessee along with other courts.' Page 211. The case was taken to the Supreme Court of the state, where a decree was entered affirming the lower court (with modifications) in which it was said:\n'The relief allowed as to the state of Georgia does not touch her sovereignty, but concerns only her contracts as to the operation of the union depot situated in the city of Chattanooga. ...'\n\n These decisions support the contention that Georgia has consented to be sued in the courts of Tennessee in respect of its railroad property in that state.\n But we need not decide the broad question whether Georgia has consented generally to be sued in the courts of Tennessee in respect of all matters arising out of the ownership and operation of its railroad property in that state. The circuit court of Hamilton county had jurisdiction in the matter of the condemnation of land for streets by the city of Chattanooga, and exercised it prior to the filing of the bill of complaint in this court. The state of Georgia and its lessee were named as parties. Notice was given to Georgia as a nonresident by publication. Having divested itself of its sovereign character, and having taken on the character of those engaged in the railroad business in Tennessee (Bank of the United States v. Planters' Bank, supra), its property there is as liable to condemnation as that of others, and it has, and is limited to, the same remedies as are other owners of like property in Tennessee. The power of the city to condemn does not depend upon the consent or suability of the owner. Moreover, the acceptance by Georgia of the permission given it to acquire the railroad land in Tennessee is inconsistent with an assertion of its own sovereign privileges in respect of that land and precludes a claim that it is not \n\n[264 U.S. 472, 483]\n\u00a0\n subject to taking for the use of the public, and amounts to a consent that it may be condemned as may like property of others.\n\n 2. \nThere is such a want of equity that the bill will be dismissed. The lack of opportunity to be heard before the passage of the ordinance opening the street furnishes no ground for complaint. The taking is a legislative and not a judicial function, and an opportunity to be heard in advance need not be given. Bragg v. Weaver, \n251 \nU.S. 57, 58\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 62. Personal service upon the owner is not essential; publication of notice is sufficient. Bragg v. Weaver, supra, 59, 61 (40 Sup. Ct. 63, 64). No complaint is made that the laws of Tennessee do not afford the state of Georgia and other owners reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before the final determination of judicial questions that may be involved in the condemnation proceedings-e. g., whether the state has delegated to the city the power to condemn; whether the taking is for a public purpose (Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles, \n262 \nU.S. 700, 705\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 689; Hairston v. Danville & Western Railway, \n208 \nU.S. 598, 606\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 331, 13 Ann. Cas. 1008); and the amount of the compensation (Seaboard Air Line Railway v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 304\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 354). Georgia has been given notice and has the right voluntarily to appear. See Clark v. Barnard, \n108 \nU.S. 436, 447\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 878. All its objections and defenses may be interposed in the Tennessee court. It appears on the face of the bill of complaint that, if it so elects, Georgia has a plain, adequate, and complete remedy in the condemnation proceedings instituted by the city. Its contention that the requisite power to condemn has not been delegated to the city involves a consideration of the meaning and proper application of the laws of Tennessee, and it is especially appropriate that the Tennessee courts shall first decide that question. The decision of its highest court on that question would be followed by this court. Maguire v. Reardon, \n255 U.S. 271\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 255; Cusack Co. v. Chicago, \n242 \nU.S. 526, 529\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 190, L. R. A. 1918A, 136, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 594; Reinman v. \n\n[264 U.S. 472, 484]\n\u00a0\n Little Rock, \n237 \nU.S. 171, 176\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 511; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 555\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 364. If the decision of that court shall deny to Georgia any rights secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States, the case may be brought here for re-examination and review. That suits in equity will not be sustained in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at law is declared by statute (Judicial Code,  267 [ Comp. St.  1244]) and established by decisions of this court so numerous that citation is not necessary.\n Bill dismissed without prejudice. \n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MISSOURI EX REL.

Jackson, of Topeka, Kan., for Helm. \n\n[265 U.S. 298, 305]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases were consolidated for argument. They present for decision the single question whether the business of the Kansas Natural Gas Company, hereinafter called the Supply Company, consisting of the transportation of natural gas from one state to another for sale, and its sale and delivery, to distributing companies, is interstate commerce, free from state interference?\n The facts necessary to be considered in reaching a conclusion are, shortly, as follows:\n The Supply Company is a Delaware corporation, engaged in producing and buying natural gas, mostly in Oklahoma but some in Kansas, and, by means of pipe lines, transporting it into Kansas and from Kansas into the state of Missouri, and in each state selling and delivering it to distributing companies, which then sell and deliver it to local consumers in numerous communities in Kansas and Missouri. The gas originating in Kansas is mingled for transportation in the same lines with that originating in Oklahoma. The pipe lines are continuous from the wells to the place of delivery.\n The three cases are alike in the fact that they arise from the action of the Supply Company in making an increase of rates from 35 cents to 40 cents per 1,000 cubic feet-in Missouri, without the consent and approval of the Public Utilities Commission of the state, and in Kansas, notwithstanding a previous order of the federal court fixing a 35-cent rate and the action of the Utilities Commission approving and fixing that rate. The power of the Utilities Commission of each state is challenged on the ground that the matter, under \n\n[265 U.S. 298, 306]\n\u00a0\n the commerce clause of the Constitution, is not subject to state control.\n In No. 155, appellants brought suit in the federal District Court to enjoin the Supply Company from increasing its rates. The injunction prayed was denied. 282 Fed. 341.\n In No. 133, the defendants in error filed a petition in the Kansas Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to compel the Supply Company to re- establish and maintain the rate of 35 cents per 1,000 cubic feet for gas furnished to the distributing companies, until otherwise ordered by the Utilities Commission. The case was presented to that court on demurrer to the return and answer. The demurrer was sustained and a peremptory writ of mandamus allowed, as prayed, 111 Kan. 809, 208 Pac. 622.\n In No. 137, the suit was to enjoin the Supply Company from collecting or attempting to collect the increased rates from various gas distributing companies until the consent thereto of the Utilities Commission of the state should be secured. The federal District Court denied the injunction, but retained the bill for another purpose, not necessary to be stated. Central Trust Co. of New York v. Consumers' Light, Heat & Power Co., 282 Fed. 680.\n The business of the Supply Company, with an exception not important here, is wholly interstate. The sales and deliveries are in large quantities not for consumption, but for resale to consumers. There is no relation of agency between the Supply Company and the distributing companies, or other relation except that of seller and buyer (Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, \n249 U.S. 236\n, 244-245, 39 Sup. Ct. 268), and the interest of the former in the commodity ends with its delivery to the latter, to which title and control thereupon pass absolutely. The question is therefore presented in its simplest form, and, if the claim of state power be upheld, it is difficult to see how it could be denied in any case of interstate transportation and sale of gas. Both federal courts denied the power. The state \n\n[265 U.S. 298, 307]\n\u00a0\n court conceded that the business was interstate and subject to federal control, but rested its decision the other way upon the fact that Congress had not acted in the matter and that, in the absence of such action, it was within the regulating power of the state.\n The question is controlled by familiar principles. Transportation of gas from one state to another is interstate commerce, and the sale and delivery of it to the local distributing companies is a part of such commerce. In Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, supra, at page 245 (39 Sup. Ct. 269) this court said:\n'That the transportation of gas through pipe lines from one state to another is interstate commerce may not be doubted; also, it is clear that as part of such commerce the receivers might sell and deliver gas so transported to local distributing companies free from unreasonable interference by the state.'\n\n See Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553, 596\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 658) and cases there cited.\n The line of division between cases where, in the absence of congressional action, the state is authorized to act, and those where state action is precluded by mere force of the commerce clause of the Constitution, is not always clearly marked. In the absence of congressional legislation, a state may constitutionally impose taxes, enact inspection laws, quarantine laws and, generally, laws of internal police, although they may have an incidental effect upon interstate commerce. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 488-491, 24 Sup. Ct. 132. But the commerce clause of the Constitution, of its own force, restrains the states from imposing direct burdens upon interstate commerce. In Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 396\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 739 (57 L. Ed. 1511, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18), Mr. Justice Hughes, speaking for the court, said:\n'If a state enactment imposes a direct burden upon interstate commerce, it must fall, regardless of federal legislation. The point of such an objection is not that Congress has acted, but that the state has directly restrained \n\n[265 U.S. 298, 308]\n\u00a0\n that which in the absence of federal regulation should be free.'\n\n The question is so fully discussed in that case, that nothing beyond its citation is required.\n The contention that, in the public interest, the business is one requiring regulation, need not be challenged. But Congress thus far has not seen fit to regulate it, and its silence, where it has the sole power to speak, is equivalent to a declaration that that particular commerce shall be free from regulation. See Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489, 493\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 592. With the delivery of the gas to the distributing companies, however, the interstate movement ends. Its subsequent sale and delivery by these companies to their customers at retail is intrastate business and subject to state regulation. Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, supra, page 245 (39 Sup. Ct. 268). In such case the effect on interstate commerce, if there be any, is indirect and incidental. But the sale and delivery here is an inseparable part of a transaction in interstate commerce-not local, but essentially national, in character-and enforcement of a selling price in such a transaction places a direct burden upon such commerce inconsistent with that freedom of interstate trade which it was the purpose of the commerce clause to secure and preserve. It is as though the commission stood at the state line and imposed its regulation upon the final step in the process at the moment the interstate commodity entered the state and before it had become part of the general mass of property therein. See Brown v. Houston, \n114 \nU.S. 622, 634\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 1091. There is nothing in Penna. Gas Co. v. Pub. Service Comm., \n252 U.S. 23\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 279, inconsistent with this view. There the Gas Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, transmitted gas from Pennsylvania into New York and sold it directly to the consumers. The service to the consumers, which was the thing for which the regulated charge was made, was essentially local and the decision rests upon this feature. Mr. Justice Day, in the \n\n[265 U.S. 298, 309]\n\u00a0\n course of the opinion, said (page 31 [40 Sup. Ct. 281]):\n'The pipes which reach the customers served are supplied with gas directly from the main of the company which brings it into the state, nevertheless the service rendered is essentially local, and the sale of gas is by the company to local consumers who are reached by the use of the streets of the city in which the pipes are laid, and through which the gas is conducted to factories and residences as it is required for use. The service is similar to that of a local plant furnishing gas to consumers in a city.'\n\n The commodity, after reaching the point of distribution in New York was subdivided and sold at retail. The Landon Case, so far as this phase is concerned, differs only in the fact that the process of division and sale to consumers was carried on, not by the Supply Company, but by independent distributing companies.\n In both cases the things done were local and were after the business in its essentially national aspect had come to an end. The distinction which constitutes the basis of the present decision is clearly recognized in the Landon Case. The business of supplying, on demand, local consumers is a local business, even though the gas be brought from another state and drawn for distribution directly from interstate mains; and this is so whether the local distribution be made by the transporting company or by independent distributing companies. In such case the local interest is paramount, and the interference with interstate commerce, if any, indirect and of minor importance. But here the sale of gas is in wholesale quantities, not to consumers, but to distributing companies for resale to consumers in numerous cities and communities in different states. The transportation, sale and delivery constitute an unbroken chain, fundamentally interstate from beginning to end, and of such continuity as to amount to an established course of business. The paramount interest is not local but national, admitting of and requiring \n\n[265 U.S. 298, 310]\n\u00a0\n uniformity of regulation. Such uniformity, even though it be the uniformity of governmental nonaction, may be highly necessary to preserve equality of opportunity and treatment among the various communities and states concerned. See, for example: Welton v. State of Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, 282; Hall v. De Cuir, \n95 U.S. 485\n, 490.\n That some or all of the distributing companies are operating under state or municipal franchises cannot affect the question. It is enough to say that the Supply Company is not so operating and is not made a party to these franchises by merely doing business with the franchise holders.\n No. 155. Affirmed.\n No. 133.

C., for the United States, as Amicus curiae. \n\n[265 U.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Morton Jourdan, of St. Louis, Mo., and Charles H. Mayer, of St. Joseph, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The ralator, the Burnes National Bank of St. Joseph, was appointed executor by a citizen of Missouri who died on November 22, 1922, leaving a will. The Bank applied to the proper Probate Court for letters testamentary, but was denied appointment on the ground that by the laws of Missouri national banks were not authorized to act as executors. Thereupon it applied to the Supreme Court of the State for a writ of mandamus to the Judge of the Probate Court and an alternative writ was issued. The respondent demurred, the demurrer was sustained and the \n\n[265 U.S. 17, 23]\n\u00a0\n peremptory writ was denied. 257 S. W. 784. A writ of error was allowed by the Chief Justice of the State Court. The Bank claims the capacity to fill the office under the statutes of the United States.\n By the Act of September 26, 1918, c. 177,  2, 40 Stat. 967, 968, amending section 11(k) of the Federal Reserve Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  9794), the Federal Reserve Board was empowered:\n'To grant by special permit to national banks applying therefor, when not in contravention of State or local law, the right to act as trustee, executor, administrator, ... or in any other fiduciary capacity in which state banks, trust companies, or other corporations which come into competition with national banks are permitted to act under the laws of the State in which the national bank is located.'\n\n If the section stopped there the decision of the state court might be final, but it adds the following paragraph:\n'Whenever the laws of such State authorize or permit the exercise of any or all of the foregoing powers by state banks, trust companies, or other corporations which compete with national banks, the granting to and the exercise of such powers by national banks shall not be deemed to be in contravention of State or local law within the meaning of this Act.'\n\n This says in a roundabout and polite but unmistakable way that whatever may be the State law, national banks having the permit of the Federal Reserve Board may act as executors if trust companies competing with them have that power. The relator has the permit, competing trust companies can act as executors in Missouri, the importance of the powers to the sustaining of competition in the banking business is so well known and has been explained so fully heretofore that it does not need to be emphasized, and thus the naked question presented is whether Congress had the power to do what it tried to do.\n The question is pretty nearly answered by the decision and fully answered by the reasoning in First National \n\n[265 U.S. 17, 24]\n\u00a0\n Bank of Bay City v. Fellows, \n244 U.S. 416\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 734, L. R. A. 1918C, 283, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1169. That case was decided before the amendment to the Federal Reserve Act that we have quoted and came here on the single issue of the power of Congress when the state law was not contravened. It was held that the power 'was to be tested by the right to create the bank and the authority to attach to it that which was relevant in the judgment of Congress to make the business of the bank successful.' \n244 U.S. 420\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 735. The power was asserted and it was added that:\n'This excluded the power of the State in such case, although it might possess in a general sense authority to regulate such business, to use that authority to prohibit such business from being united by Congress with the banking function.' \n244 U.S. 425\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 737.\n\n Now that Congress has expressed its paramount will this language is more apposite than ever. The States cannot use their most characteristic powers to reach unconstitutional results. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 190; Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 56\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 232; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 114\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278. There is nothing over which a State has more exclusive authority than the jurisdiction of its courts, but it cannot escape its constitutional obligations by the device of denying jurisdiction to courts otherwise competent. Kenney v. Supreme Lodge of the World, \n252 \nU.S. 411, 415\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 371, 10 A. L. R. 716. So here-the State cannot lay hold of its general control of administration to deprive national banks of their power to compete that Congress is authorized to sustain.\n The fact that Missouri has regulations to secure the safety of trust funds in the hands of its trust companies does not affect the case. The power given by the Act of Congress purports to be general and independent of that circumstance and the Act provides its own safeguards. The authority of Congress is equally independent, as otherwise the State could make it nugatory. Since the decision in First National Bank of Bay City v. Fellows, \n\n[265 U.S. 17, 25]\n\u00a0\n \n244 U.S. 416\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 734, L. R. A. 1918C, 283, it generally has been recognized that the law now is as the relator contends.

E. 617; In re Mollineaux, 109 Misc. Rep. 75, 179 N. Y. Supp. 90. Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Enright (D. C.) 264 Fed. 236.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (dissenting).\n The real question here, as I understand it, is not whether Congress may safeguard national banks against ordinary state legislation of a discriminative character; but whether Congress may intrude upon and prohibit the exercise of the governmental powers of a state to the extent that such exercise discriminates against such banks in favor of competing state corporations. The authority of the Fellows Case, I think, is pressed too far. The statute there under review simply made national banks competent to act as executors, etc., 'when not in contravention of state or local law.' The statute did not attempt to override the will of the state in that respect, but expressly recognized its control and authority. The state Supreme Court conceded that the powers thus conditionally conferred by the federal statute, in fact, would not be in contravention of the state law, but held that Congress was without constitutional authority, because the functions sought to be given to such banks were subject of state regulation. That view of the matter was rejected; but, putting aside some expressions not necessary to the decision, I do not think the case can be regarded as authority for the conclusion, apparently now reached, that Congress may so limit the power of a state, against its expressly declared will to the contrary, that it may confer the right to act as executors and administrators upon state corporations which compete with national banks, only upon condition that the same right be conferred \n\n[265 U.S. 17, 26]\n\u00a0\n upon the latter. Certainly that precise question was not there presented for decision.\n It is fundamental, under our dual system of government, that the nation and the state are supreme and independent, each within its own sphere of action, and that each is exempt from the interference or control of the other in respect of its governmental powers, and the means employed in their exercise. Bank of Commerce v. Comrs. of Taxes and Assessments, 2 Black, 620, 634; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 U.S. 437\n, 452, et seq., 26 Sup. Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 737; Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 U.S. 679\n, 685 (24 L. Ed. 558). 'How their respective laws shall be enacted; how they shall be carried into execution; and in what tribunals, or by what officers; and how much discretion, or whether any at all shall be vested in their officers, are matters subject to their own control, and in the regulation of which neither can interfere with the other.' Tarble's Case, 13 Wall. 397, 407, 408. Except as otherwise provided by the Constitution, the sovereignty of the states 'can be more invaded by the action of the general government, than the action of the state governments can arrest or obstruct the course of the national power.' Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 570 (8 L. Ed. 483).\n In Bank of Commerce v. Comrs. of Taxes and Assessments, supra, pages 633, 634, a tax case, this court said:\n'That government whose powers, executive, legislative or judicial , ... are subject to the control of another distinct government, cannot be sovereign or supreme, but subordinate and inferior to the other. This is so palpable a truth that argument would be superfluous. Its functions and means essential to the administration of the government, and the employment of them, are liable to constant interruption and possible annihilation. ... But of what avail is the function or the means if another government may tax it at discretion? It is apparent that the power, function, or means, however important and vital, are at the mercy of that government. And it must be always \n\n[265 U.S. 17, 27]\n\u00a0\n remembered, if the right to impose a tax at all exists on the part of the other government, 'it is a right which in its nature acknowledges no limits.' And the principle is equally true in respect to every other power or function of a government subject to the control of another.'\n\n It is settled beyond controversy, that the right of a state to pass laws, to administer them through courts of justice, and to employ agencies for the legitimate purpose of state government cannot be taxed (Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 547); and that rule is but an application of the general and broader rule, which forbids any interference by the federal government with the governmental powers of a state. The settlement of successions to property on death is a subject within the exclusive control of the states and entirely beyond the sphere of national authority. See Tilt v. Kelsey, \n207 \nU.S. 43, 55\n, 56 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 1; Plummer v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115, 137\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 829. Upon the death of the owner his property passes under the control of the state, and remains there until all just charges against it can be determined and paid and those who are entitled to become its new owners can be ascertained. The duty and power of the state to provide a tribunal for the accomplishment of these ends (Tilt v. Kelsey, supra), it follows, cannot be abridged by federal legislation.\n The right of the owner to direct the descent of this property by will or permit it under statute, as well as the right of a legatee, devisee or heir to receive the property, are rights exclusively derived from and regulated by the state. Plummer v. Coler, supra, page 137. During the process of administration the estate, in contemplation of law, is in the custody of the court exercising probate powers, and to this court the executor or administrator is an officer. Yonley v. Lavender, 21 Wall. 276, 280 (22 L. Ed. 536). 'An administrator appointed by a state court is an officer of that court; his possession of the decedent's property is a possession taken in obedience to the orders of that court; \n\n[265 U.S. 17, 28]\n\u00a0\n it is the possession of the court. ...' Byers v. McAuley, \n149 \nU.S. 608, 615\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 906.\n In the present case the state Legislature as conclusively determined by the state Supreme Court, has excluded not only national banks but state banks from assuming the functions of executors and administrators, which functions, for reasons satisfactory to itself, it has allowed trust companies to exercise. This determination of the state to grant the right to one and not the other, when it might have excluded both, is plainly the assertion of a governmental policy upon a matter within its exclusive control, with which the federal government has no authority to meddle. Congress may, of course, confer upon national banks the capacity to act as administrators and executors; but I do not think it is within the constitutional authority of that body to make such legislation binding upon the state against its will. The decision just rendered perhaps does not go that far; but it does uphold the power of Congress to impose its will upon the state in this respect if the state, in the exercise of its exclusive authority over the devolution of estates of deceased persons, permits any corporation which competes with national banks to exercise the powers mentioned. This contingency seems to me a slender distinction upon which to found a denial of the state's power. It may be conceded that a state is precluded from enforcing legislation which discriminates against national banks, in respect of private banking or business operations; but a very different situation is presented when the discrimination arises in respect of the governmental operations of the state. A state, for example, cannot be sued in its own courts without its consent; but is it powerless to consent to such suits by financial corporations of its own creation except upon condition that it extends a similar privilege to competing national banks? Legislation requiring all residents of a state to deposit their funds only in state institutions \n\n[265 U.S. 17, 29]\n\u00a0\n would undoubtedly be bad against federal legislation to the contrary; but is it beyond the power of the state Legislature to subject public moneys- state, county or municipal-to such a restriction? A state may not unconditionally require private debts to be paid only in gold and silver; but, in the exercise of its sovereign power of taxation, it may limit the payment of taxes to gold and silver, if it sees fit, in spite of a federal law making currency a legal tender, and, as this court has said:\n'It is not easy to see upon what principle the national Legislature can interfere with the exercise, ... of this power.' Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 77 (19 L. Ed. 101).\n\n In my opinion, the exercise of the powers conferred upon trust companies by the legislation here under review, is governmental in its nature; and the fact that the statute discriminates in that matter against national banks (as also it does against state banks) is a negligible incident, which does not affect the validity of the statutory limitation.\n The probate courts of a state have only such powers as the state Legislature gives them. They are wholly beyond the jurisdiction of Congress, and it does not seem to me to be within the competency of that body, on any pretext, to compel such courts to appoint as executor or administrator one whom the state law has declared shall not be appointed.\n The particular invasion here sanctioned may not be of great moment; but it is a precedent which, if carried to the logical extreme, would go far toward reducing the states of the Union to the status of mere geographical subdivisions. The case is one, to use the phrase of Mr. Justice Brewer in Fairbank v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 283, 291\n, 292 S., 21 Sup. Ct. 648, for the application of the maxim, 'obsta principiis, not de minimis non curat lex.'\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MISSOURI EX REL. ST. LOUIS B. & M. RY. CO. v. TAYLOR(1924)\nNo. 89\nArgued: October 17, 1924Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 200, 201]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. M. U. Hayden, Edward J. White, and James F. Green, all of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 200, 203]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. L. London, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[266 U.S. 200, 206]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The American Fruit Growers, Inc., a Delaware corporation with the usual place of business in Missouri, brought an action against the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway Company in an inferior court of Missouri. Jurisdiction was asserted solely by reason of the garnishment of traffic balances due from a connecting interstate carrier having a place of business in Missouri. The Brownsville Company is a Texas corporation, operates its railroad solely in that state, has no place of business in Missouri, and has not consented to be sued there. The cause of action sued on consisted of three claims of a consignee for damages to freight originating in Texas on lines of the Brownsville Company and shipped on through bills of lading to points in other states.\n The Brownsville Company did not enter an appearance, general or special. Instead, it instituted in the Supreme Court of Missouri an application for a writ of prohibition-the proceeding here under review- praying that the judge of the inferior court be enjoined from taking cognizance of the pending action because he lacked jurisdiction. The highest court of the state denied relief. 298 Mo. 474, 251 S. W. 383. The case is here on writ of error, and also on certiorari. \n263 \nU.S. 696\n, 44 S. Ct. 132, 68 L Ed. 511. The suggestion was made, at the argument, that this court is without jurisdiction, because the judgment below was not final. \n263 \nU.S. 696\n, 44 S. Ct. 132, 68 L. Ed. a writ of prohibition is an independent adversary suit which was finally determined by the judgment under review. Detroit & Mackinac Ry. Co. v. Michigan \n\n[266 U.S. 200, 207]\n\u00a0\n Railroad Commission, \n240 \nU.S. 564, 570\n, 36 S. Ct. 424. The writ of error must, however, be dismissed for another reason. See Stadelman v. Miner, \n246 \nU.S. 544\n, 38 S. Ct., 359.\n The claim that the inferior court of Missouri lacked jurisdiction of the action for damages is rested on two grounds. One contention is that the Missouri attachment law, as construed and applied, is void under the rule of Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Equity Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312\n, 43 S. Ct. 556, and Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Wells, \n265 \nU.S. 101\n, 44 S. Ct. 469. The facts of this case differ vitally from those involved there. Here, the plaintiff consignee is a resident of Missouri-that is, has a usual place of business within the state; the shipment out of which the cause of action arose was of goods deliverable in Missouri;1 and, for aught that appears, the negligence complained of occurred within Missouri. To require that, under such circumstances, the foreign carrier shall submit to suit within a state to whose jurisdiction it would otherwise be amenable by process of attachment does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce.\n The other contention is more strenuously urged. It is argued that the cause of action on which the consignee sues is the liability of the initial carrier for a loss occurring through the negligence of a connecting carrier; that this liability arises out of a federal law. Carmack Amendment, June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  7, pars. 11, 12, 34 Stat. 584 595 (Comp. St.  8604a, 8604aa); that the conditions under which the federal right may be enforced are the same whether the plaintiff proceeds in the state court or the federal court; that original jurisdiction could not have been obtained by attachment in a federal court for Missouri, because personal service could not be made upon the Brownsville Company, Ex \n\n[266 U.S. 200, 208]\n\u00a0\n parte Railway Co., \n103 U.S. 794\n; Big Vein Coal Co. v. Read, \n229 \nU.S. 31\n, 33 S. Ct. 694; and that, therefore, no court of the state could entertain a suit to enforce the claim.\n The argument is unsound. Congress created the right of action. It might have provided that the right shall be enforceable only in a federal court. It might have provided that state courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction only of those cases which, by the applicable federal law, could, under the same circumstances, have been commenced in a federal court for the particular state. But Congress did neither of these things. It dealt solely with the substantive law. As it made no provision concerning the remedy, the federal and the state courts have concurrent jurisdiction. Galveston, etc., Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n223 \nU.S. 481, 490\n, 32 S. Ct. 205. The federal right is enforceable in a state court whenever its ordinary jurisdiction is prescribed by local laws is appropriate to the occasion and is invoked in conformity with those laws. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 56\n, 57 S., 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; Claflin v. Houseman, \n93 \nU.S. 130, 136\n, 137 S..\n Missouri conferred jurisdiction over claims of this nature upon the court in which the consignee sued. Under its law, this jurisdiction may be exercised, to the extent of applying property attached to the satisfaction of a claim, even though personal service cannot be made upon the defendant. That remedy is one which was not available to the consignee in the federal court for Missouri. But this fact is not of legal significance. Compare Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109\n, 44 S. Ct. 274. The origin of the right does not affect the manner of administering the remedy. The grant of concurrent jurisdiction implies that, in the first instance, the plaintiff shall have the choice of the court. As an incident, he is entitled to whatever remedial advantage inheres in the particular forum. Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. \n\n[266 U.S. 200, 209]\n\u00a0\n 211, 221, 36 S. Ct. 595, L. R. A. 1917A, 86, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 505. No peculiarity of state procedure will be permitted to enlarge or to abridge a substantive federal right. Central Vermont Ry. Co. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 511\n, 35 S. Ct. 865, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 252; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. v. Burnette, \n239 \nU.S. 199\n, 36 S. Ct. 75; New Orleans & Northeastern R. R. Co. v. Harris, \n247 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 38 S. Ct. 535; Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. R. Co. v. Mullins, \n249 \nU.S. 531\n, 39 S. Ct. 368. But to enforce a claim by subjecting property within the state to its satisfaction, through attachment proceeding, does not enlarge the substantive right.\n The practice of obtaining in this way satisfaction of a claim in personam against an absent defendant is not one abhorrent to, or uncommon in, federal courts. In admiralty, district courts take original jurisdiction under such circumstances. Atkins v. Disintegrating Co., 18 Wall. 272. At law, they do so on removal. When the case is removed, it proceeds to judgment in the federal court and the judgment is enforced there as against the attached property with the same effect as if the cause had remained in the state court. Clark v. Wells, \n203 \nU.S. 164\n, 27 S. Ct. 43.\n Writ of error dismissed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This is true only of one of the three shipments on account of which the action was brought. But if the inferior court had jurisdiction as to any one, it was obviously proper to deny the writ of prohibition. \n\n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF NORTH DAKOTA v. STATE OF MINNESOTA(1924)\nNo. 10\nArgued: Decided: January 21, 1924\n\n\n\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The clerk has asked instruction concerning the taxation of costs.\n By far the greater number of suits between states have been brought for the purpose of settling boundaries. \n1\n In the first, Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 4 How. 591, 639, the bill was dismissed. There was no provision as to costs in the decree and the record of fees is not available. In \n\n[263 U.S. 583, 584]\n\u00a0\n Missouri v. Kentucky, 11 Wall. 395, the bill was dismissed with costs, from which we infer that the defeated party paid them. In the remaining 13 the costs were equally divided.\n In Nebraska v. Iowa. \n143 \nU.S. 359, 370\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 396, 400 (36 L. Ed. 186) Justice Brewer, speaking for the court, said:\n'The costs of this suit will be divided between the two states, because the matter involved is one of those governmental questions, in which each party has a real and vital, and yet not a litigious, interest.'\n\n And in Maryland v. West Virginia, \n217 \nU.S. 577, 585\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 630, 632 (54, L. Ed. 888), Mr. Justice Day delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'The matter involved is governmental in character, in which each party has a real, and yet not a litigious, interest. The object to be obtained is the settlement of a boundary line between sovereign states in the interest, not only of property rights, but also in promotion of the peace and good order of the communities, and is one which the states have a common interest to bring to a satisfactory and final conclusion. Where such is the nature of the cause we think the expenses should be borne in common, so far as may be, and we therefore adopt so much of the decree proposed by the state of Maryland as makes provision for the costs of the surveys made under the orders of this court.'\n\n The same rule, however, does not apply to cases in which the parties have a litigious interest. In New Hampshire v. Louisiana, and New York v. Louisana, \n108 \nU.S. 76, 91\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 176, the complainant states brought suits upon bonds of Louisiana assigned to them by their citizens for the purpose of avoiding the inhibition of the Eleventh Amendment. The suits were dismissed, with costs adjudged against the complainants.\n In Sough Dakota v. North Carolina, \n192 \nU.S. 286, 321\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 269, the suit was on bonds of North Carolina donated by the original purchasers to South Dakota, and there was judgment \n\n[263 U.S. 583, 585]\n\u00a0\n for South Dakota for the amount due, with costs of suit.\n In Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 U.S. 496\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 268, which was a bill to restrain Illinois and her subordinate agency, the Chicago Sanitary District, from discharging sewage into the Mississippi and exposing the people of Missouri to danger of typhoid fever from germs in their drinking water, the bill was dismissed without prejudice, but the costs were adjudged against the complainant state.\n In New York v. New Jersey, \n256 \nU.S. 296, 313\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 492, the bill sought to restrain the pollution of the harbor of New York. The bill was dismissed without prejudice, but the costs were adjudged against New York.\n In Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 117\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 655, the suit was brought to enjoin diversion of flowing water. Apparently the court regarded the issue as a nonlitigious one, the settlement of which would be useful to both states, and, following the boundary cases, divided the costs. In Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 U.S. 496\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 594; Id., \n260 \nU.S. 1, 3\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 2, where the issue was similar, the costs were adjudged one-third to Wyoming, one-third to Colorado, and one-third to two corporate defendants at whose expense the case had been defended by Colorado.\n The present proceeding is clearly a litigious one. The persons whose lands were overflowed raised a fund to conduct the litigation. The bill of North Dakota asked for a decree of injunction with $5,000 for damages to state property and $1,000,000 for damages to residents of North Dakota, with the purpose, presumably, of distributing the latter sum to injured residents, contributors to the fund. The exact agreement as to the use of the funds thus raised does not appear in the record. When the state engineer of North Dakota, Mr. Ralph, the chief witness for the state, was cross-examined in respect to it, he refused to answer by advice of counsel for North Dakota. The natural inference is that the fund was being \n\n[263 U.S. 583, 586]\n\u00a0\n used in the conduct of the litigation.

Gen., for the State of Texas.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By the order of May 5 last (\n265 U.S. 76\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 457, 68 L. Ed . --) certain questions suggested in the twelfth report of the receiver in this case were propounded to the parties in interest. Many responses were received, a hearing on them was had, and the court is now prepared to announce its ruling.\n The first question is: To what extent and in what manner shall the general expenses of the receivership be \n\n[265 U.S. 505, 508]\n\u00a0\n spread over the several impounded funds in the receiver's custody?\n Two areas are within the receivership, one designated as the south half of the river bed and the other as the flood plain. The latter consists of a stretch of low ground between the river bed and the Texas bluffs, and is divided into several relatively small tracts. The impounded funds consist, in the main, of proceeds from oil and gas taken, during the receivership, from wells in the two areas. Accurate accounts have been kept showing the production, proceeds, and special expenses pertaining to each well. But as yet there has been no allocation or apportionment of the general expenses.\n At the inception of the receivership both areas were in controversy. Texas and her grantees were claiming title to both; the United States was doing the same, and Oklahoma was claiming title to the river-bed area. These proprietary controversies were largely incidental to a pronounced controversy respecting the true boundary between the two states. Texas was insisting that the boundary was along the middle of the river; Oklahoma and the United States that it was along the foot of the Texas bluffs. All of the controversies were real and were earnestly pressed on the court's attention. In the progress of the case the court has considered and decided all of them. As a result it now is settled that the interstate boundary is not along the middle of the river, nor along the foot of the Texas bluffs, but on and along the south bank of the river, that the flood- plain area belongs to Texas or her grantees, that the river-bed area belongs to the United States, and that Oklahoma has no proprietary interest in either area.\n Most of the river-bed wells were drilled and brought in by the receiver; all wells in that area have been operated by him, and he now holds the net proceeds derived from them. Most of the flood-plain wells were drilled \n\n[265 U.S. 505, 509]\n\u00a0\n and brought in before the receivership by claimants asserting grants from the state of Texas or leasehold rights under such grants. Under a provision in the original receivership order (paragraph 4, \n252 U.S. 374\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 353), and a provision in a succeeding order ( paragraph 2, \n253 U.S. 466\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 580, 1017), most of the flood-plain wells have been operated by such claimants and their assigns under arrangements whereby the receiver was to direct and supervise the operation, was to receive and hold three-sixteenths of the gross proceeds, and could take over the operation if the arrangement was not respected. The receiver now holds the accumulated three-sixteenths of such proceeds. A few exceptional flood-plain wells-we mean wells south of the interstate boundary as now established-have been operated throughout by the receiver, and he now holds the full net proceeds derived from them.\n The parties in interest differ about the apportionment to be made of the general expenses. The Texas claimants, both owners and lessees, take the position that, as they have prevailed in the controversy over the flood plain, the funds derived from that area should be exempted from the apportionment. On the other hand, the United States insists that the apportionment should extend to all the funds, flood-plain as well as river- bed, and be on a pro rata basis. There is also a difference among the Texas claimants, in that the owners insist that, if the apportionment be made to cover the flood-plain funds, these expenses should be charged against the moneys going to the lessees, while the latter ask that the charge be against the moneys going to the owners.\n Obviously we are not here concerned with a situation where the outcome of the matter in litigation should be given controlling significance. The controversy over the flood plain was real, as much so as that over the river-bed area; and there was ample reason for including both areas in the receivership. Its purpose was to conserve the \n\n[265 U.S. 505, 510]\n\u00a0\n oil and gas values in those areas for the benefit of whoever might prove to be entitled to them; and that purpose has been accomplished. That the Texas claimants have prevailed as to the flood plain is no reason for exempting it from the general expenses. A like reason would require that the river bed be also exempted, for as to it the United States prevailed. The usual rule in such receiverships is to charge the general expenses ratably against all the impounded funds, unless there be special circumstances making it inequitable to do so. Here there are no circumstances calling for an exemption of the flood-plain funds; but there are circumstances making it equitable to charge against them a smaller proportion of the general expenses than is charged against the river-bed funds. Taking the full period of the receivership, the work and responsibility of the receiver's force has been perceptibly less in respect of the flood-plain wells than in respect of those in the river bed. Fairly estimated, we think the difference has been about one to two on each dollar impounded. But this difference in favor of the flood-plain wells applies only to such as have been operated by private claimants. The exceptional ones operated by the receiver are in this particular on substantially the same footing as the river-bed wells.\n We conclude that the general expenses should be spread over all the funds in such way that the charge against each dollar impounded from river- bed wells, or from flood-plain wells operated by the receiver-in all of which the impounding has covered the full proceeds, less special expenses- shall be double what is charged against each dollar impounded from flood- plain wells operated by private claimants where the impounding has covered only three-sixteenths of the proceeds.\n As to the Texas owners and lessees, we perceive no ground for making one rather than the other bear the \n\n[265 U.S. 505, 511]\n\u00a0\n charge for general expenses. The interests of both have been conserved, and the charge to be made against the total moneys going to both in any instance should be deducted ratably from what goes to each separately.\n The second question is: How shall the expense or loss incident to work done by the receiver on river-bed wells which proved unremunerative be distributed or cared for?\n The river-bed area is a single tract belonging to the United States. Others have no present interest in it. The United States concedes that the expense or loss indicated may be charged against funds derived from remunerative wells in that area. We think the concession is right and that effect should be given to it.\n The third question is whether the order of June 1, 1921 (\n256 U.S. 607\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 539, 1118), authorizing the receiver, where any river-bed well was drilled and brought into production prior to the receivership, to reimburse the operator for the actual cost of that work out of the proceeds from such sell, shall be enlarged so as to permit the receiver, where the same operator had drilled another river-bed well which proved unremunerative, to reimburse him for the cost of the latter out of the proceeds of the remunerative well. The United States objects to the change suggested, and we think it should not be made. All drilling for oil in the river-bed area was without right and without encouragement from the United States, the owner of the soil. Apart from the trespass involved, the operator assumed the risk of the venture; and if the well proved unremunerative it was his loss. On no equitable principle can he ask to be reimbursed. The order referred to is confined to wells which were utilized by the receiver and enriched the estate in his custody. Even in that form the order is one of marked liberality, considering the entire absence of any right to drill in the river-bed area. The situation requires, we think, that each well be regarded in this matter as a distinct venture. \n\n[265 U.S. 505, 512]\n\u00a0\n The fourth question is: Should the order just mentioned be changed so as to cover river-bed well No. 139, known as the Burk-Senator well?\n This well was expressly excepted from the order because there was a bitter controversy as to who drilled it and brought it into production. The well had been drilled and was producing oil when the receiver took possession. It is the only one of that class where the operator has not been reimbursed. We think the excepting clause should be eliminated from the order to the end that the receiver may effect an equitable adjustment of the matter, if the contesting operators are so disposed.\n Two phases of another matter connected with that well should be disposed of at this time. Under a contract with one of the contesting operators Tom Testerman participated in drilling the well. Some equipment belonging to him and used in that work came into the possession of the receiver and afterwards was sold by the receiver. Testerman asks that the receiver be authorized to pay over to him the money received for the property. That authority should be given. Testerman also asserts that the Bass Petroleum Company, another of the contesting operators, forcibly took possession of the well and converted a part of his equipment to its use, and he asks that he be reimbursed for that wrong out of impounded funds derived from flood-plain wells claimed by that company. This request cannot be entertained. The right to redress for such a wrong, committed prior to the receivership, is not a matter which can be considered or determined in this suit. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKL. v. STATE OF TEXAS(1924)\nNo. 13\nArgued: Decided: November 18, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. S. P. Freeling, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for State of Oklahoma. \n\n[266 U.S. 298, 299]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. A. Keeling, of Mexia, Tex., Thomas Watt Gregory, of Washington, D. C., C. W. Taylor, of Corsicana, Tex., and Orville Bullington and A. H. Carrigan, both of Wichita Falls, Tex., for the State of Texas.\n Mr. John S. Flannery, of Washington, D. C., for receiver.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n At the last term the state of Texas presented a petition for an order requiring the receiver to pay, out of the proceeds \n\n[266 U.S. 298, 300]\n\u00a0\n from receivership wells found to be south of the interstate boundary, the gross-production tax which the state law exacts of those who engage in producing crude oil from wells within the state. On consideration of the petition the court issued to the receiver the instructions which are set forth in paragraph 4 of the order of June 9, last. \n265 \nU.S. 513\n, 44 S. Ct. 608. The receiver collected the requisite data and otherwise prepared to make payments of the tax computed on so much of the oil produced from each well as was represented by the proceeds actually impounded in his hands. But the state questioned that mode of computation and insisted that the total production be taken as the basis of the computation; so the receiver withheld payment until the question could be brought to the attention of the court.\n In other paragraphs of the order of June 9 the receiver was instructed to make necessary preparations for closing up the receivership, to have his books and accounts examined and audited by designated public accountants, to surrender the oil wells to the rightful claimants, and to pay the net proceeds remaining in his hands to the owners, lessees, etc., entitled to them. There were pressing reasons why this work should go ahead and not be deferred until the tax question was settled. The receiver accordingly set aside from the impounded proceeds from each well, in so far as they were sufficient, the amount which would be required to pay the tax in respect of that well in the event the computation should be based on the full production, and he then proceeded with the work. That work is now far advanced, some of it being completed. The receiver's books and accounts have been audited; statements of the receipts and expenses pertaining to each well, certified by the public accountants, have been transmitted to the several owners, lessees, etc.; the time allotted for presenting objections has expired, and the checks for the balances shown to be awaiting disbursement, \n\n[266 U.S. 298, 301]\n\u00a0\n after deducting the amount set aside for the gross-production tax and a further sum to cover remaining receivership expenses, have been drawn and are ready for transmission, save in exceptional instances where confiicting claims need to be adjusted or determined.\n The state now presents a supplemental petition asking that the instructions given on the original petition be so modified as to require that payments of the gross-production tax be computed on the full production, and also to require payment of another tax not mentioned before.\n The gross-production tax is prescribed by article 7383 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas and an amendment adopted in 1923. Chapter 45, 2d Called Sess. It is denominated an 'occupation tax' and is laid on all who engage in producing crude oil from wells within the state. Up to April 1, 1923, the tax was 1 1\/2 per cent. of the market value of the oil, and since that date it has been 2 per cent. The other tax is prescribed by section 11 of an act passed in 1917 to regulate common carrier pipe lines engaged in transporting crude oil. Chapter 30, Laws 1917 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. Supp. 1918, art. 732 1\/2 j). It is laid on the same persons and in the same manner as the gross-production tax and is to be used in paying salaries and expenses incident to the enforcement of the pipe-line regulations. The tax is one-twentieth of 1 per cent. of the market value of the oil produced.\n This is an interstate boundary suit and has been entertained in virtue of the original jurisdiction which the Constitution confers on this court in respect of controversies between states. The appointment of the receiver and the conduct of the receivership, like the other proceedings, have been in virtue of that jurisdiction. In all that the receiver has done he has been the court's agent and representative. In operating the oil wells in the area in dispute, he was not engaged in a business or pursuing an occupation in the ordinary acceptation of those terms, but as an officer of the court was conserving the property within \n\n[266 U.S. 298, 302]\n\u00a0\n that area for the benefit of those to whom it ultimately might prove to belong. The state recognizes that all this is true, and so does not seek to subject the receiver to the taxes described, but only to have them paid out of the proceeds of the oil production which are in his hands and ready to be paid over to those for whose ultimate benefit the wells have been operated. In other words, the state seeks, through the equitable aid of the court, to have the taxes paid out of these proceeds before they are turned over to the beneficiaries on whom the taxes otherwise would fall. This aid is invoked on the ground that during the receivership many of the beneficiaries have become insolvent or left the state, so that the collection of the taxes by other means would be attended with embarrassment, and in some instances be impossible.\n As to the gross-production tax, we think the state is equitably entitled to the relief sought, and that the amounts to be paid should be computed on the full production. Sufficient money has been set aside, and the payments can be made without material inconvenience or appreciable interruption of other work. In a few instances the tax already has been paid by parties in interest; and of course it should not be paid again. There are also instances where a part only of the proceeds was impounded and the net balance in the receiver's hands is not sufficient to pay the full tax. In such cases the payment necessarily will be limited to the net balance in hand. Because of the difference in ownership each well should be treated as a separate unit in computing the tax and making the payments. As between owners and lessees the amounts paid should be charged against the lessees, on whom as between the two the tax would fall.\n As to the other tax, we think the state's request should be denied. It comes so late that the weight of equitable considerations is against its allowance. To grant it would require a readjustment of many of the receiver's accounts, \n\n[266 U.S. 298, 303]\n\u00a0\n would delay the distribution of the proceeds, which in the aggregate reach large figures, and would be distinctly prejudicial to many claimants. Other objections to it have been suggested, but they need not be considered.\n An order will be entered in accordance with this opinion.\n On consideration of the supplemental petition of the state of Texas for a modification of paragraph 4 of the order of June 9, last, it is ordered that the petition be denied in so far as it relates to the tax prescribed in section 11 of the Texas statute of February 20, 1917, regulating pipe lines-the denial to be without prejudice to such right as the state may have to collect this tax from persons other than the receiver-and that paragraph 4 of the said order of June 9, last, relating to the payment of the gross-production tax prescribed by article 7383 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, as amended by an act of June 2, 1923, be so modified as to require (a) that the amounts to be paid by the receiver be computed on the full production of each well; (b) that the payment in respect of any well be not in excess of the net proceeds from that well remaining in the receiver's hands; (c) that the payments be only of such part of the tax as has not been paid by parties in interest; and ( d) that as between owners and \n\n[266 U.S. 298, 304]\n\u00a0\n lessees the payments by the receiver be charged against the lessees, they being the ones on whom as between the two the tax would fall. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA v. STATE OF TEXAS(1924)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 490, 491]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arch Dawson and H. O. Williams, both of Wichita Falls, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In a recent report of the receiver in this case, he called attention to an action brought against him in the district court of Wichita county, Tex., by J. H. Duhon and H. J. Kebideaux, the object of which is to enforce payment by him of the claim hereinafter described. On examining the report, this court ordered the plaintiffs in that action to show cause why they should not be enjoined from maintaining it. In due time they submitted a response.\n The claim sought to be enforced is one for reimbursement for the cost of drilling an oil well in the river bed, and, if paid, must be paid out of an impounded fund in the receiver's custody. The well was drilled prior to the receivership, and without right. In no possible view did the drilling give rise to an enforceable claim against the receiver or against any property in the receivership.\n The right asserted against the receiver is based on a busequent order of this court. \n256 U.S. 607\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 539, 1118. That order is not imperative or mandatory; nor does it purport to give any operator or driller a right to be reimbursed. On the contrary, it commits the question of reimbursement to the receiver's discretion. Its words are, 'is hereby authorized, in his discretion,' etc. Obviously the receiver's action in a matter committed to his discretion by this court cannot be controlled by any other court. The plaintiffs say that the receiver recognized their claim. Even so, they assert and reassert that there has been no \n\n[265 U.S. 490, 492]\n\u00a0\n reimbursement. If this be true, the matter still rests in the receiver's discretion. A mere recognition of the claim would not terminate his discretion. He would be free to reconsider until there was an actual reimbursement.\n If the plaintiffs desired to enforce reimbursement regardless of the receiver's discretion, they should have applied to this court for a mandatory order. No other court could change the existing order, or require the receiver to surrender his discretion under it; and yet that is what the plaintiffs seek to accomplish by their action against the receiver. They rely on section 66 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1048), which reads as follows:\n'Every receiver or manager of any property appointed by any court of the United States may be sued in respect of any act or transaction of his in carrying on the business connected with such property, without the previous leave of the court in which such receiver or manager was appointed; but such suit shall be subject to the general equity jurisdiction of the court in which such manager or receiver was appointed so far as the same may be necessary to the ends of justice.'\n\n Whether the section rightly understood applies to a receiver appointed by this court in a suit within its original jurisdiction we need not consider. In terms it is confined to suits against a receiver in respect of his acts or transactions while carrying on the business of the receivership. Here the receiver is not sued in respect of any act or transaction of his in the course of the business, but in respect of acts occurring prior to the receivership, for the cost of which this court by a subsequent order authorized him, in his discretion, to make reimbursement. Under the plaintiffs' showing, the receiver's only connection with the matter has been a refusal to exercise his discretion favorably to them. That, in our opinion is not such an act or transaction as the section intends. Buckhannon & Northern R. R. Co. v. Davis, 135 Fed. 707, 711, 68 C. C. A. 345. \n\n[265 U.S. 490, 493]\n\u00a0\n Our conclusion is that an injunction should issue restraining the plaintiffs from maintaining their action. Such an injunction, in the circumstances disclosed, may issue consistently with section 265 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1242). Wells Fargo & Company v. Taylor, \n254 U.S. 175\n, 41 Sup.

Ct. 573.] The report of such commissioners of the time employed and expense incurred in that work is also approved, and the receiver is directed to pay the sums specified in such report and to charge the same against the impounded funds derived from the river-bed wells.\n\n 4. \nOn consideration of the motion of the state of Texas that the receiver pay out of the proceeds of the receivership wells south of the interstate boundary the production tax prescribed by the laws of that state, it is ordered that \n\n[265 U.S. 513, 515]\n\u00a0\n the receiver be authorized, out of the impounded proceeds from every such well, to pay such tax in respect of such impounded proceeds and to charge the same against such well as an expense specially pertaining to it. But before making any such payment the receiver shall request the Attorney General of the state of Texas, and the parties interested in the fund from which the payment is to be made, to submit to him definite statements showing the amount of the tax and whether it has been otherwise paid. If in any instance the receiver is in doubt respecting the propriety of the payment he shall withhold it and report the matter to this court for further instructions.\n\n 5. \nThe receiver is instructed to distribute pro rata over the impounded funds in his custody all interest received on receivership moneys, all discounts collected and all other similar items of profit arising from the general operations or business of the receivership, and not from particular wells.\n\n 6. \nThe receiver is authorized to take all proper steps to obtain payment of all accounts and claims that may be due or owing to him as such receiver and to report to the court at its next term all of such accounts and claims as then may remain unpaid with his recommendations respecting the measures to be taken to enforce payment.\n\n 7. \nThe receiver is directed to publish a final notice to all persons asserting or holding claims against him or the receivership rising out of matters accruing since the claims notice of June 1, 1921, to present such claims within 40 days after the first publication of such notice, in default of which the claims will be barred.\n\n 8. \nThe receiver is instructed to make no reimbursement, under the order of June 1, 1921 (\n256 U.S. 607\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 539, 1118), or otherwise, to any operator or driller for work done on any river- bed well prior to the receivership where the well has proved to be a dry hole or unproductive, and all \n\n[265 U.S. 513, 516]\n\u00a0\n applications and suggestions that reimbursement be made for such work are overruled.\n\n 9. \nThe receiver is instructed to spread the general expenses of the receivership over all the impounded funds in his custody in such way that each dollar in the funds derived from river-bed wells, and in those derived from flood-plain wells which have remained in the operation of the receiver, will bear twice as much of such expenses as each dollar in the funds derived from flood-plain wells which have been operated by private claimants will bear. The spreading shall be made evenly over all moneys in the funds bearing the lesser share of the expenses, and evenly over all moneys in the funds bearing the larger share. No distinction shall be made between moneys going to owners of flood-plain wells and moneys going to lessees of such wells. Neither shall be exempted and the spreading over the two shall be on a pro rata basis.\n 10. All expenses and losses incident to work done by the receiver on river-bed wells which proved unremunerative shall be charged against the funds derived from remunerative wells in the river bed.\n 11. The receiver is authorized to pay to Tom Testermann the sum received by the receiver on the sale by him of equipment belonging to Mr. Testermann which had come into the possession of the receiver.\n 12. The petition of Tom Testermann asking that he be reimbursed out of funds enuring to the Bass Petroleum Company, its successor or assigns, for the conversion by such company, prior to the receivership, of property claimed by Mr. Testermann is denied.\n 13. Notwithstanding the exception if well No. 139, known as the Burk- Senator well, from the order of June 1, 1921 (\n256 U.S. 607\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 539, 1118), the receiver is authorized, in his discretion, to reimburse the operators who drilled that well prior to the receivership for the cost of that work, \n\n[265 U.S. 513, 517]\n\u00a0\n if the operators who participated therein are disposed to adjust the differences between them and to accept a reimbursement which is satisfactory to the receiver.\n 14. The receiver is authorized to surrender to the Secretary of the Interior, as the representative of the United States, the possession of all of the south half of the river bed, now in the receivership, with all oil wells, pipe lines and other property pertaining to such river bed-the surrender to be made at the close of business on the 30th of June, 1924, or as soon thereafter as the Secretary of the Interior is prepared to take over that property.\n 15. The receiver is authorized to deliver to the Secretary of the Interior, as the representative of the United States, at the time of the surrender named in the last paragraph the office buildings, equipment and supplies belonging to the receivership and intended for use in its oil and gas operations-the delivery to be at a valuation agreed upon between the Secretary of the Interior and the receiver. The agreed price shall be charged to the United States and credited to the receiver as a partial payment to the former of the money enuring to it as proceeds of river-bed wells.\n 16. The receiver is authorized to pay over to the Secretary of the Interior, as the representative of the United States, at the time of the surrender and delivery named in the last two paragraphs approximately two- thirds of the net impounded funds derived from the river-bed wells.\n 17. The receiver is authorized to surrender to the several owners or lessees entitled thereto, as soon as arrangements therefor satisfactorily can be made, the possession of the flood-plain wells which he is now operating, together with the pipe lines and fixtures pertaining to them. If there be controversy or doubt as to who is entitled to any particular well the receiver shall withhold its surrender \n\n[265 U.S. 513, 518]\n\u00a0\n for the time being and pursue the course indicated in the next paragraph of this order.\n 18. The receiver is instructed to publish notice to all claimants to funds in his custody derived from flood-plain wells (meaning wells south of the interstate boundary as now established) to present their claims to such funds within 40 days after the first publication of such notice-the presentation to be in the form of a definite statement of what is claimed and of the claimant's title. After the expiration of 20 days more the receiver shall be authorized, where there are no conflicting claims, to pay the proceeds from any well or wells, less expenses and charges, to the proper claimant or claimants. If there be controversy or doubt as to who is entitled to the proceeds from any well the receiver shall withhold action as to such proceeds and report the matter to this court at its next term for further instructions.\n 19. The receiver is directed to have all of his accounts audited as of the close of business on June 30, 1924, by an expert public accountant designated by the Chief Justice. \n\n\n\n","163":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA v. STATE OF TEXAS(1924)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 493, 494]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George F. Short, of Oklahoma City Okl., for the State of oklahoma.\n Messrs. C. W. Taylor, of Corsicana, Tex., A. H. Carrigan, of Wichita Falls, Tex., W. A. Keeling, of Mexia, Tex., and T. W. Gregory, of Washington, D. C., for the State of Texas.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On April 25 last the commissioners appointed to run, survey, and mark portions of the boundary between the states of Texas and Oklahoma along the Red river under our decree of March 12, 1923 (\n261 U.S. 340\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 376), submitted their report covering the portion of the boundary along the Big Bend Area, and at the same time submitted their report of the survey and platting of the medial line of the river in the vicinity of the river-bed oil wells pursuant to a supplemental order of June 4, 1923 (\n262 U.S. 505\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 701). When the reports were received, general leave was given to parties in interest to except to the reports, or either of them, within a period of four weeks. \n264 U.S. 565\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 455, 68 L. Ed. --. Exceptions to the boundary report were presented by the state of Oklahoma, the Grand Oil & Developing Company, and William A. Fondren, and informal protests against its confirmation were received from Frank W. Thaison and J. E. Lester. No exceptions were taken to the medial line report. On May 26 a hearing before the court was had on the boundary report; but nothing of \n\n[265 U.S. 493, 495]\n\u00a0\n an evidential nature was offered in support of any of the exceptions or protests.\n The informal protests by Mr. Thaison and Mr. Lester require only passing notice. They neither show that their authors have any legal interest in the location of the boundary, nor state any facts indicative of error in the work or report of the commissioners.\n The exceptions of the Grand Oil & Developing Company and Mr. Fondren show that the exceptors have at best only a conjectural future interest in the location of the boundary. It is a conjectural interest, because it is founded on the hope that applications which the exceptors have made for oil and gas leases of parts of the southerly half of the river bed, under the Act of March 4, 1923, c. 249, 42 Stat. 1448, will be granted by the Secretary of the Interior. And it is a future interest, because it has not come into existence as yet, and because the sixth section of the act precludes the Secretary from granting such leases before the property is released from the existing receivership. Even after the release, the Secretary's authority will extend to such lands only as may lie between the interstate boundary and the medial line of the river, as the two are settled by this court. Under present conditions, the United States has the sole proprietary interest in whatever may be within those limits, and it is not excepting to the boundary reported by the commissioners. Plainly these exceptors do not have such a present or certain interest in the subject as entitles them to complain.\n We deem it proper, however, to notice one feature of Mr. Fondren's exceptions. In them he asserts that the commissioners were selected as representing respectively the United States and the state of Texas, and that counsel for the state of Oklahoma were remiss in not insisting on the selection of a third commissioner representing that state. The assertion rests on a misapprehension of what \n\n[265 U.S. 493, 496]\n\u00a0\n occurred. Originally there was a purpose to select three commissioners and to direct that the boundary be surveyed and marked for its full length along the river, 539 miles. But as the southerly cut bank, held by the court to be the true boundary, afterwards was conceded to be so well defined throughout the greater part of the distance that it need not be surveyed or marked (paragraph 12 of decree, \n261 U.S. 343\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 376, 67 L. ed. 687), the court deemed it better and in the interest of economy to commit the work on the portions of the boundary not covered by that concession to two commissioners, instead of three. The two were selected by the court as its representatives, not as representatives of any of the parties. The commissioners so understood. Counsel for Oklahoma were not remiss in the matter. Shortly after the two commissioners were selected, counsel for that state, including the Attorney General, requested that a third commissioner be selected, and the request was denied.\n The state of Oklahoma, of course, has a legal interest in the location of the boundary and a right to except to the report, for her territorial jurisdiction is involved. Her exceptions are on two grounds. The first is that the commissioners have not given proper effect to the sixth paragraph of the decree (\n261 U.S. 340\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 376), which with the opinion on which it was based (\n260 U.S. 606\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 221), was to be their guide. A right understanding of that paragraph requires that it be read with the fifth and seventh. The three are as follows:\n'5. The south bank of the river is the water-washed and relatively permanent elevation or aclivity, commonly called a cut bank, along the southerly side of the river which separates its bed from the adjacent upland, whether valley or hill, and usually serves to confine the waters within the bed and to preserve the course of the river.\n\n'6. The boundary between the two states is on and along that bank at the mean level attained by the waters \n\n[265 U.S. 493, 497]\n\u00a0\n of the river when they reach and wash the bank without overflowing it.\n\n'7. At exceptional places where there is no well defined cut bank, but only a gradual incline from the sand bed of the river to the upland, the boundary is a line over such incline conforming to the mean level of the waters when at other places in that vicinity they reach and wash the cut bank without overflowing it.'\n\n To sustain the exception, the state relies entirely on the introductory part of the report where, after setting forth the three paragraphs just quoted, the commissioners say:\n'The foregoing specifications applied in the light of the opinion, admit of, and require the exercise of practical judgment in determining the line intended; but certain fundamentals, such as the following, obviously must form the final basis for the exact location of the line.\n\n'The boundary line is a gradient of the flowing water in the river. It is located midway between the lower level of the flowing water that just reaches the cut bank, and the higher level of it that just does not overtop the cut bank. The physical top of the cut bank being very uneven in profile, cannot be a datum for locating the boundary line, but a gradient along the bank must be used for that purpose. The highest point on this gradient must not be higher than the lowest acceptable point on the bank in that vicinity. The boundary line has been determined accordingly.'\n\n We find nothing in what was thus said which indicates that the commissioners misapprehended the decree or failed to give proper effect to it, and after examining their report and the accompanying maps we think the decree was rightly construed and given full effect. The gradients used as representing the ordinary high and mean levels of the waters, when washing, but not overflowing, \n\n[265 U.S. 493, 498]\n\u00a0\n the bank, were not unbroken lines arbitrarily projected from one end of the Big Bend Area to the other, but were broken lines adjusted to prevailing levels in relatively short sections. That course was both reasonable and practical. Within the 16 miles along that area the river varies in width from 2,200 feet to 6,000 feet. Naturally the waters when entering the narrower sections choke and attain higher levels, and when entering the broader sections spread out and fall to lower levels. There is nothing in the decree to prevent a reasonable and practical solution of the problem incident to these varying water levels. And so of the problem incident to the irregularities in the elevation of the bank. The state, although excepting to the solution adopted by the commissioners, does not attempt to point out a better one. In our opinion the exception is not tenable.\n The second exception is that the commissioners regarded an extensive addition to the south bank as an accretion caused by natural processes, whereas it was caused by an artificial structure placed in the river by the receiver and should have been disregarded. The facts relating to this addition to the bank, as shown by the record in this cause, various photographic exhibits produced in evidence on former hearings, and the maps accompanying the report of the commissioners, are as follows:\n In 1920, when the receiver took possession, a definite channel and active current were near the south bank. Four oil wells had been drilled, or were in process of drilling, in the river bed close to that bank. A short wing dam had been extended into the river above the wells. The receiver made a change in the wing dam and extended it down stream in front of and near the wells. Winds in dry weather and the water during rises in the river commenced to deposit sand and other material behind the dam and about the wells. But quite independently \n\n[265 U.S. 493, 499]\n\u00a0\n of the dam the river shortly thereafter washed away a large section of the opposite bank on the north and shifted its principal channel to that side. The channel on the south side soon filled with sand. The river continued gradually to erode the north bank, and at the same time there was a gradual but slower accretion to the south bank. In this way the river moved northward, the north bank being cut away as much as 1,400 feet from where it was in 1920, and an accretion from 60 to 80 feet in width being added to the south bank of that period. The change is apparent when map exhibit No. 26 produced by the United States and Oklahoma on the principal hearing in this case is compared with the maps accompanying the commissioners' report. The 60 or 80 feet of accretion has come to be of the same elevation as the former bank, has similar vegetation on it where oil or oil operations have not been in the way, and otherwise appears to be stable land. the process of accretion is still active and now the new formation slopes, for 200 feet beyond the stable accretion, into the river bed and has the appearance of a sandy shore The commissioners regarded the south bank as carried to the outer line of the 60 or 80 feet, and located the boundary accordingly. Their location was based on the situation existing December 31, 1923\n\n\n On the facts disclosed, we think the commissioners were right. The boundary between the two states is not an unswerving line, but a river bank, and where through the natural and gradual processes of erosion or accretion the bank is changed the boundary follows the change. We so said in the opinion and decree which were to guide the commissioners. The wing dam was at most a minor factor in producing the accretion and does not take the change out of the general rule. County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46. We accordingly overrule the exception. \n\n[265 U.S. 493, 500]\n\u00a0\n Both reports will be approved, and a decree will be entered giving effect to the boundary along the Big Bend Area as run, surveyed, and marked by the commissioners. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA v.

[500-Continued.]\n On consideration of the report of the commissioners, heretofore selected to run, locate, and mark portions of the boundary between the states of Texas and Oklahoma along the south bank of the Red river, showing that they have run, located and marked the portion of such boundary along the Big Bend Area, such report being as follows:\n Report of the Boundary Commissioners.\n To the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States:\n As commissioners designated in the decree of March 12, 1923, in the above entitled cause, we have run, located and marked upon the ground the boundary between the \n\n[265 U.S. 500, 501]\n\u00a0\n states of Texas and Oklahoma along the Red river in what is known as the Big Bend Area (Area A) in accordance with that decree and the principles announced in the opinion delivered January 15, 1923, and we have the honor to submit the following joint report respecting that part of our work, with field notes and maps.\n Paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the decree follow:\n'5. The south bank of the river is the waterwashed and relatively permanent elevation or acclivity, commonly called a cut bank, along the southerly side of the river which separates its bed from the adjacent upland, whether valley or hill, and usually serves to confine the waters within the bed and to preserve the course of the river.\n\n'6. The boundary between the two states is on and along that bank at the mean level attained by the waters of the river when they reach and wash the bank without overflowing it.\n\n'7. The exceptional places where there is no well defined cut bank, but only a gradual incline from the sand bed of the river to the upland, the boundary is a line over such incline conforming to the mean level of the waters when at other places in that vicinity they reach and wash the cut bank without overflowing it.'\n\n The foregoing specifications applied in the light of the opinion, admit of, and require the exercise of practical judgment in determining the line intended; but certain fundamentals, such as the following, obviously must form the final basis for the exact location of the line.\n The boundary line is a gradient of the flowing water in the river. It is located midway between the lower level of the flowing water that just reaches the cut bank, and the higher level of it that just does not overtop the cut bank. The physical top of the cut bank being very uneven in profile, cannot be a datum for locating the boundary line; but a gradient along the bank must be \n\n[265 U.S. 500, 502]\n\u00a0\n used for that purpose. The highest point on this gradient must not be higher than the lowest acceptable point on the bank in that vicinity. The boundary line has been determined accordingly.\n We have marked the boundary line by wooden posts called 'witness posts' set along the bank at varying short distances from the boundary, and from each other. A bearing and distance has been taken from each witness post to one or more points on the boundary.\n Permanent reference monuments are located at varying intervals on the Texas bluff overlooking the river valley. Other permanent reference monuments are located on the Oklahoma bluff, and these overlook the river valley.\n By accurate surveys the witness posts are joined to each other and to the monuments on the Texas bluff. Similarly the Texas monuments are joined to each other and to the Oklahoma monuments, which in turn, are joined to each other and to the witness posts. Permanent bench marks located near the boundary are also joined to the witness posts and to the reference monuments.\n All oil wells within three hundred feet of the boundary have been accurately located upon the ground, and the position of each, whether in Texas or in Oklahoma, is stated. From each oil well, a bearing and distance is given to a point on the boundary.\n The boundary line is shown by the usual symbol and appropriate wording on the accompanying maps, which also show the positions of the witness posts, the oil wells, the reference monuments, the bench marks and other information usually appearing on such maps. These maps are made part of this report and are identified as follows:\n Map No. 1: Cadastral Map of the Big Bend Area. \n\n[265 U.S. 500, 503]\n\u00a0\n Map No. 2: Cadastral Map of the oil field region, in two sheets, Nos. 1 and 2.\n Map No. 3: Topographic Map of the Big Bend Area, in four sheets, Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, contour interval 2 feet. \n\n[265 U.S. 500, 503]\n\u00a0\n-Continued \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 500, 503]\n\u00a0\n-Continued \n\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 500, 503]\n\u00a0\n-Continued \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 500, 503]\n\u00a0\n-Continued\n The survey was begun April 16, 1923, and completed February 17, 1924. The location of the boundary, reported herewith, is that position which existed on December 31, 1923.\n The surveying has been done with painstaking care in accordance with approved modern methods. The results have been subjected to one or more tests to verify their accuracy. The field notes have been reduced to the minimum, consistent with the proper record of the boundary location.\n The geographic positions are on the standard datum of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey; the datum of the elevations in mean sea level.\n The field notes of the boundary, location of oil wells, description of reference monuments and witness posts, and tables of azimuths, distances, geographic positions and sea level elevations, follow:\n TRAVERSE OF WITNESS POSTS AND CONNECTIONS TO BOUNDARY AND REFERENCE MONUMENTS\n Beginning at reference monument No. 1 on the Texas bluff, as such monument is hereinafter defined, thence north, on an extension of the east line of range 13 west in Oklahoma, 2,138.2 ft. (32.397 chs.) to witness post 0. This point is on the flood plain within the river valley 455 ft. south of the top of the cut bank.

So help me God.'\n\n A statement of the time employed and the expense incurred in the performance of the work will be the subject of a later report.\n Five copies each of the report and maps have been to-day sent by registered mail to the Attorney General of the United States, the Attorney General of Texas and the Attorney General of Oklahoma. We also have filed with the clerk of the court fifty copies of the report and maps for the use of such private interveners as may apply for them. Thirty additional copies of the report and maps have been filed with the clerk for such disposition as the court may direct.\n The originals of the three maps hereinbefore named are bound with the original report, and appear in the following order: Map No. 1, Map No. 2, Sheets Nos. 1 and 2, and Map No. 3, Sheets Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.\n Respectfully submitted,\n Arthur D. Kidder,\n Arthur A. Stiles, Commissioners.\n Washington, D. C., April 25, 1924.\n Report of Medial Line Survey. \n1\n To the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States:\n In obedience to and in conformity with the order of June 4, 1923 (\n262 U.S. 505\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 701), we have surveyed and run upon the ground and have delineated upon an appropriate map the medial line between the state boundary along the south bank of Red river and the northerly bank thereof for a distance of three miles in the vicinity of the river bed oil wells, and we beg to submit this joint report of that work, with field notes and map.\n The survey was begun June 29, 1923, and completed February 17, 1924. The location of the medial line, as so established and delineated, conforms to the physical situation existing on December 31, 1923, the date as of which we ran, located and marked the boundary between the states of Texas and Oklahoma along the reveivership oil area as shown and described in our report thereof filed contemporaneously with this report.\n Besides locating the state boundary along the south [504-Continued.]\nbank as shown in the other report, a meander line of the north bank was run in the usual manner, for purposes of accurate platting and to aid in determining the location of the medial line. Temporary markers were placed at the angle points along the north bank.\n The establishment of the medial line conforms specifically to the provisions of the fifth paragraph of the decree of March 12, 1923 (\n261 U.S. 345\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 376), entitled 'Supplement to Partial Decree of June 5, 1922,' which paragraph reads as follows:\n'5. In the sense intended herein, the medial line of the river is a line drawn midway between the northerly and southerly banks of the river, commonly called cut banks, save that, under a stipulation between the parties affected, to which full effect must be given, this line, in so far as it reaches and is in contact with patented or allotted tracts which are within what is now the bed of the river, shall be regarded and treated as falling no farther north than the southerly line of such tracts as the same were represented by the official survey according to which they were patented or allotted.'\n\n To carry out those provisions, the 1875 meander line of section 8, of township 5 south, range 14 west, of the Indian meridian, in Oklahoma, was retraced and re-established, because that line forms the southerly line of patented or allotted tracts, which are within what is now the bed of the river, as such southerly line was represented by the official survey of the United States according to which those tracts were patented or allotted. The meander line of 1875 was retraced and re-established in conformity with the rules stated in the Manual of Instructions for the Survey of the Public Lands of the United States, with markers located in true position.\n The location of the medial line was then determined by running twenty- three cross-sections of the river, by accurate measurement from bank to bank to determine the exact mid-point positions. These mid-points were then connected by straight and curved lines in a manner designed to produce a true and connected medial line conforming to the directions and curves of the two banks, considered together. Markers were placed in the river bed to show and aid in retracing the line. A number of the markers are immediately on the medial line, but some are only near to it and are in the nature of witness posts, being connected up with the line by course and distance as shown in the field notes.\n All of these markers are heavy iron pipe, called 'drill stem,' 4 inches in diameter, 20 feet long, driven through the sand into the hard clay and shale of the river bed, leaving 30 inches exposed. The material, outfit and crew for this work were furnished by the receiver in this suit. Bronze tablets were placed in the tops of the pipes, each tablet being marked as indicated upon the map. [504-Continued.]\n The map which forms a part of this report, is more specifically identified as Map No. 2 of the boundary survey, and is a cadastral map of the oil field region, in two sheets, Nos. 1 and 2.\n All oil wells within 300 feet of the medial line have been accurately located and are shown in the field notes and upon the map.\n The field notes follow:\n MEANDERS OF NORTH BANK.\n Beginning at witness post No. 100, near the north point of the 'Big Bend,' as such post is described in the field notes of the boundary survey, and from which post a point on the south bank of the river bears N. 15\u00f8 W., 16 ft. dist.; thence\n N. 11\u00f800' W., on river cross-section, 2,157.5 ft. ft.

Laws 1911, p. 345. The state maintains that the objections to such requirement pointed out in Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 U.S. 149\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145, were removed by the Act of June 10, 1922, c. 216, 42 Stats. 634 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  991 [ 3], 1233).1 Its Supreme Court ruled otherwise. 122 Wash. 572, 582, 211 Pac. 724, 212 Pac. 1059\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 219, 222]\n\u00a0\n In No. 684 the Supreme Court of California approved the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Washington and declared the Act of June 10, 1922, went beyond the power of Congress. It accordingly held the Industrial Accident Commission had no jurisdiction to award compensation for the death of a workman killed while actually engaged at maritime work, under maritime contract, upon a vessel moored at her dock in San Francisco Bay and discharging her cargo. 220 Pac. 669.\n The judgments below must be affirmed; the doctrine of Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, to which we adhere, permits no other conclusion. There we construed the Act of October 6, 1917, c. 97, 40 Stat. 395 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  991 \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 3]\n\u00a0\n, 1233)2 which undertook \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 223]\n\u00a0\n to amend the provision of sections 24 and 256, Judicial Code, which saves to suitors in all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction 'the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it,' by adding the words 'and to claimants the rights and remedies under the Workmen's Compensation Law of any state.' After declaring the true meaning and purpose of the act, we held it beyond the power of Congress.\n Except as to the master and members of the crew, the act of 1922 must be read as undertaking to permit application of the workmen's compensation laws of the several states to injuries within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction substantially as provided by the act of 1917. The exception of master and crew is wholly insufficient to meet the objections to such enactments heretofore often pointed out. Manifestly, the proviso which denies jurisdiction to District Courts of the United States over causes arising out of the injuries specified was intended to supplement the provision covering rights and remedies under state compensation laws. As that provision is ineffective, so is the proviso. To hold otherwise would bring about an unfortunate condition wholly outside the legislative intent.\n Counsel insist that later conclusions of this court have modified the doctrine of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, and Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart. They rely especially upon Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 U.S. 233\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 89, Grant Smith- Porter Co. v. Rohde, \n257 U.S. 469\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008, and Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Co., \n259 U.S. 263\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 473, 25 A. L. R. 1013.\n Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen involved a claim under the New York Compensation Act for death resulting from injuries sustained while the deceased was on board and engaged in unloading the vessel. We held (\n244 \nU.S. 216, 217\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 529, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900):\n'It would be difficult, if not impossible, to define with exactness just how far the general maritime law may be changed, modified, or affected by state legislation. That \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 224]\n\u00a0\n this may be done to some extent cannot be denied. ... Equally well established is the rule that state statutes may not contravene an applicable act of Congress of affect the general maritime law beyond certain limits. ... And plainly, we think, no such legislation is valid if it contravenes the essential purpose expressed by an act of Congress or works material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law or interferes with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations. This limitation, at the least, is essential to the effective operation of the fundamental purposes for which such law was incorporated into our national laws by the Constitution itself. ... The work of a stevedore in which the deceased was engaging is maritime in its nature; his employment was a maritime contract; the injuries which he received were likewise maritime; and the rights and liabilities of the parties in connection therewith were matters clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction. Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 60 S.. If New York can subject foreign ships coming into her ports to such obligations as those imposed by her compensation statute, other states may do likewise. The necessary consequence would be destruction of the very uniformity in respect to maritime matters which the Constitution was designed to establish, and freedom of navigation between the states and with foreign countries would be seriously hampered and impeded. A far more serious injury would result to commerce than could have been inflicted by the Washington statute authorizing a materialman's lien condemned in The Roanoke. The Legislature exceeded its authority in attempting to extend the statute under consideration to conditions like those here disclosed.'\n\n In Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart (\n253 \nU.S. 163, 164\n, 166 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 441 (64 L. Ed. 834, 11 A. L. R. 1145), where claim was made under the New York act on account of the death of a bargeman who fell into the Hudson river and drowned, this was said:- \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 225]\n\u00a0\n 'We conclude that [by the Act of October 6, 1917] Congress undertook to permit application of Workmen's Compensation Laws of the several states to injuries within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and to save such statutes from the objections pointed out by Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen. It sought to authorize and sanction action by the states in prescribing and enforcing, as to all parties concerned, rights, obligations, liabilities, and remedies designed to provide compensation for injuries suffered by employees engaged in maritime work.\n'And, so construed, we think the enactment is beyond the power of Congress. Its power to legislate concerning rights and liabilities within the maritime jurisdiction and remedies for their enforcement, arises from the Constitution, as above indicated. The definite object of the grant was to commit direct control to the federal government, to relieve maritime commerce from unnecessary burdens and disadvantages incident to discordant legislation, and to establish, so far as practicable, harmonious and uniform rules applicable throughout every part of the Union.\n\n'Considering the fundamental purpose in view and the definite end for which such rules were accepted, we must conclude that in their characteristic features and essential international and interstate relations, the latter may not be repealed, amended, or changed, except by legislation which embodies both the will and deliberate judgment of Congress. The subject was intrusted to it to be dealt with according to its discretion-not for delegation to others. To say that, because Congress could have enacted a compensation act applicable to maritime injuries, it could authorize the states to do so as they might desire, is false reasoning. Moreover, such an authorization would inevitably destroy the harmony and uniformity which the Constitution not only contemplated but actually established; it would defeat the very purpose of the grant. See Sudden & Christenson v. Industrial Accident Commission, 188 Pac. Rep. 803. \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 226]\n\u00a0\n\n\n'Congress cannot transfer its legislative power to the states-by nature this is nondelegable. ...\n\n'Here we are concerned with a wholly different constitutional provision-one which, for the purpose of securing harmony and uniformity, prescribes a set of rules, empowers Congress to legislate to that end, and prohibits material interference by the states. Obviously, if every state may freely declare the rights and liabilities incident to maritime employment, there will at once arise the confusion and uncertainty which framers of the Constitution both foresaw and undertook to prevent.'\n\n In Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, a proceeding begun in admiralty to recover damages for death of a stevedore, fatally injured while working in the hold of a vessel then anchored and discharging her cargo, we held (\n257 U.S. 242\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 90):\n'As the logical result of prior decisions, we think it follows that, where death upon such waters results from a maritime tort committed on navigable waters within a state whose statutes give a right of action on account of death by wrongful act, the admiralty courts will entertain a libel in personam for the damages sustained by those to whom such right is given. The subject is maritime and local in character, and the specified modification of or supplement to the rule applied in admiralty courts, when following the common law, will not work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, nor interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.'\n\n Grant Smith-Porter Co. v. Rohde was a proceeding in admiralty to recover damages from the shipbuilder for injuries which the carpenter received while working on an unfinished vessel moored in the Willamette river at Portland, Or. 'The contract for constructing the Ahala was nonmaritime, and although the incompleted structure upon which the accident occurred was lying in \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 227]\n\u00a0\n navigable waters, neither Rohde's general employment nor his activities at the time had any direct relation to navigation or commerce.' We held the matter was only of local concern, and that to permit the rights and liabilities of the parties to be determined by the local law would not interfere with characteristic features of the general maritime rules. We also pointed out the conclusion was in entire accord with prior cases.\n Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Co. related to a claim based upon death which resulted from injuries received by the long-shoreman while on the dock-a matter never within the admiralty jurisdiction. 'Insana was injured upon the dock, an extension of the land (Cleveland Terminal & Valley R. R. Co. v. Cleveland S. S. Co., \n208 U.S. 3162\n), and certainly prior to the Workmen's Compensation Act the employer's liability for damages would have depended upon the common law and the state statutes. Consequently, when the Compensation Act superseded other state laws touching the liability in question, it did not come into conflict with any superior maritime law. And this is true, whether awards under the act are made as upon implied agreements or otherwise. The stevedore's contract of employment did not contemplate any dominant federal rule concerning the master's liability for personal injuries received on land.'\n None of the later causes depart from the doctrine of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen and Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, and we think the provisions of the act of 1922 cannot be reconciled therewith.\n Without doubt Congress has power to alter, amend, or revise the maritime law by statutes of general application embodying its will and judgment. This power, we think, would permit enactment of a general Employers' Liability Law or general provisions for compensating injured employees; but it may not be delegated to the several states. The grant of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction looks to \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 228]\n\u00a0\n uniformity; otherwise, wide discretion is left to Congress. Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart. Exercising another power-to regulate commerce-Congress has prescribed the liability of interstate carriers by railroad for damages to employees (Act April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 [Comp. St.  8657-8665]) and thereby abrogated conflicting local rules. New York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139.\n This cause presents a situation where there was no attempt to prescribe general rules. On the contrary, the manifest purpose was to permit any state to alter the maritime law and thereby introduce conflicting requirements. To prevent this result the Constitution adopted the law of the sea as the measure of maritime rights and obligations. The confusion and difficulty, if vessels were compelled to comply with the local statutes at every port, are not difficult to see. Of course, some within the states may prefer local rules; but the Union was formed with the very definite design of freeing maritime commerce from intolerable restrictions incident to such control. The subject is national. Local interests must yield to the common welfare. The Constitution is supreme.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n The reasoning of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, and cases following it, never has satisfied me and therefore I should have been glad to see a limit set to the principle. But I must leave it to those who think the principle right to say how far it extends.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n A concern, doing a general upholstering business in New York, directs one of its regular employees, resident there, to make repairs on a vessel lying alongside a New York dock. The ship, then temporarily out of commission, is owned and enrolled in New York, and when used is employed \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 229]\n\u00a0\n only within the state. While on the vessel engaged in making the repairs, the employee is injured without the fault of any one and is disabled for life. A statute of New York provides that, in such a case, he and his dependents shall receive compensation out of funds which employers are obliged to provide. To such state legislation Congress has, in express terms, given its sanction. Under the rule announced by the court, the federal Constitution prohibits recovery. \n3\n If, perchance, the accident had occurred while the employee so engaged was on the dock, the Constitution would permit recovery. \n4\n Or, if happily he had been killed and the accident had been due to the employer's negligence, recovery (which is provided for by another state statute) would likewise be permitted under the Constitution, even though the accident had occurred on board the vessel. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Constitution contains, of course, no provision which, in terms, deals, in any way, with the subject of workmen's compensation. The prohibition found by the court rests solely upon a clause in section 2 of article 3:- \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 230]\n\u00a0\n 'The judicial power [of the United States] shall extend ... to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The conclusion that the state law violates the Constitution and that the consent of Congress cannot save it, is reached solely by a process of deduction. The chain of reasoning involved is a long one. The argument is that the grant of judicial power to the United States confers upon Congress, by implication, legislative power over the substantive maritime law; that this legislative power in Congress (while not necessarily exclusive) precludes state legislation which 'works material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law or interferes with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international or interstate relations'; that there is a rule of the general maritime law by which an employer is not liable, except in case of negligence, for an occupational injury occurring on board a vessel; that the rule applies whenever the vessel on which the injury occurs is afloat on navigable water, even if the vessel, made fast to a dock, is out of commission; that the rule applies to occupations which, like upholstering, are not in their nature inherently maritime; that the rule governs the relations not only of the ship and its owners to their employees, but also the relations of independent contractors to their employees who customarily work on land; that this rule is a characteristic feature of the general maritime law; that for a state to change the rule, even as applied to independent contractors doing work on craft moored to a dock, temporarily disabled, and normally employed wholly within the state, interferes with the \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 231]\n\u00a0\n proper harmony and uniformity of the general maritime law in its international and interstate relations; and that hence a statute of a state, which provides that employers within it shall be liable to employees within it for occupational accidents occurring within it, violates the federal Constitution, notwithstanding the state statute is expressly sanctioned by Congress.\n Such is the chain of reasoning. Every link of the chain is essential to the conclusion stated. If any link fails, the argument falls. Several of the links are, in may opinion, unfounded assumption, which crumbles at the touch of reason. How can a law of New York, making a New York employer liable to a New York employee for every occupational injury occurring within the state, mar the proper harmony and uniformity of the assumed general maritime law in its interstate and international relations, when neither a ship, nor a shipowner, is the employer affected, even though the accident occurs on board a vessel on navigable waters? The relation of the independent contractor to his employee is a matter wholly of state concern. The employer's obligation to pay and the employee's right to receive compensation are not dependent upon any act or omission of the ship or of its owners. To impose pose upon such employer the obligation to make compensation in case of an occupational injury in no way affects the operation of the ship. Nor can it affect the shipowners in any respect, except as every other tax, direct or indirect, laid by a state or municipality may affect, by increasing the cost of living and of doing business, every one who has occasion to enter it and many who have not. \n7\n This is true of the application of the Workmen's Compensation Law, whether the service rendered by the independent contractor is in its nature non- \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 232]\n\u00a0\n maritime, like upholstering, or is inherently maritime, like stevedoring. The requirement by the state is a regulation of the business of upholstering or stevedoring. It is not a regulation of shipping. It in no respect attempts to modify, or deal with, admiralty jurisdiction or procedure, or the substantive maritime law. It is but an exercise of the local police power. \n8\n To impose upon the independent employer the obligation to provide compensation for accidents occurring on a vessel in port, while the vessel is made fast to the dock, in fact, cannot conceivably interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of the general maritime law in its international or interstate relations.\n Moreover, it is not a characteristic feature of the general maritime law that the employer, in case of accident, is liable to an employee only for negligence. The characteristic feature is the very contrary. To one of the crew, the vessel and her owners are liable, even in the absence of negligence, for maintenance, care, and wages, at least so long as the voyage is continued. To him they are liable, also, even in the absence of negligence, for indemnity or damages, if the injury results from unseaworthiness of the ship, or from failure to supply and keep in order the proper appliances. \n9\n The legal rights, in case of accident to persons other than members of the crew, were not determined by the maritime law until recently. The admiralty court, instead of extending to these persons this characteristic feature, borrowed the rule of negligence from the common-law courts, making modifications conformable to its views of justice. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[264 U.S. 219, 233]\n\u00a0\n The mere fact that the accident is an incident of a maritime contract, and the service performed thereunder is inherently maritime, does not preclude the application of the workmen's compensation law. The stevedore can recover under the workmen's compensation law, if the injury happens to occur on land, although the contract of the stevedoring concern is confessedly a maritime one, and the stevedore is employed in a maritime service quite as much while he is on the dock as after he crosses the gangplank and enters the ship. \n11\n Underlying the whole chain of reasoning, by which the conclusion is reached that the state and federal statutes are unconstitutional, will be found the legally indefensible assumption that the liability under the Workmen's Compensation Law is governed by the law of the locality in which the accident happened; that is, by the rule that in tort the test of admiralty jurisdiction is presence on navigable waters. There is no more reason why the mere fact that the injury occurs on navigable waters should make applicable the maritime law to liabilities arising under the Workmen's Compensation Law than that it should make the maritime law applicable, in such cases, to the liability under a general accident insurance policy. Tort is, in fact, not an element in the liability created by the Workmen's Compensation Law. \n12\n On the contrary, the basis of this legislation is liability without fault. Nor does the Workmen's Compensation Law create a status between employer and employee. It provides an incident to the employment which is often \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 234]\n\u00a0\n likened to a contractual obligation, even where the Workmen's Compensation Law is not of the class called optional. It will hardly be contended that an act occurring beyond the geographical limits of a state cannot be made the basis for the creation of rights to be enjoyed or enforced within it. Workmen's Compensation Laws which provide for compensation for injuries occurring in states other than that of the residence of the employer and the employee are held constitutional. \n13\n Why should they not be deemed valid where they provide for accidents occurring within the state, but upon navigable waters?\n A further assumption is that Congress, which has power to make and to unmakethe general maritime law, can have no voice in determining which of its provisions require adaptation to peculiar local needs and as to which absolute uniformity is an essential of the proper harmony of international and interstate maritime relations. This assumption has no support in reason; and it is inconsistent (at least in principle) with the powers conferred upon Congress in other connections. The grant 'of the ... judicial power ... to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction' is surely no broader in terms than the grant of power 'to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states.' Yet as to commerce, Congress may, at least in large measure, determine whether uniformity of regulation is required or diversity is permissible. \n14\n Likewise, Congress is given exclusive power of legislation over its forts, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful places and buildings. But it may permit the \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 235]\n\u00a0\n diverse laws of the several states to govern the relations of men within them. \n15\n Congress has exclusive power to legislate concerning the Army and Navy of the United States, to declare war, to determine to what extent citizens shall aid in its prosecution, and how effective aid can best be secured. But state legislation directly affecting these subjects has been sustained. \n16\n In respect to bankruptcy, duties, imposts, excises and naturalization the Constitution prescribes uniformity. Still the provision in the Bankruptcy Law giving effect to the divergent exemption laws of the several states was held valid. \n17\n Absolute uniformity in things maritime is confessedly not essential to the proper harmony of the maritime law in its interstate and international relations. This is illustrated both by the cases which hold constitutional state regulation of pilotage and liens created by state laws in aid of maritime contracts, and by those which hold that there are broad fields of maritime activity to which admiralty jurisdiction does not extend. A notable instance of the latter is the liability in tort for injuries inflicted by a ship to a dock, or to maritime workers on the dock engaged in the inherently maritime operation of stevedoring. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n The recent legislation of Congress seeks, in a statesmanlike manner, to limit the practical scope and effect of our decisions in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 U.S. 149\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145, and later cases, by making them hereafter applicable only to the \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 236]\n\u00a0\n relations of the ship to her master and crew. To hold that Congress can effect this result by sanctioning the application of state Workmen's Compensation Laws to accidents to any other class of employees occurring on the navigable waters of the state would not, in my judgment, require us to overrule any of these cases. It would require merely that we should limit the application of the rule therein announced, and that we should declare our disapproval of certain expressions used in the opinions. Such limitation of principles previously announced, and such express disapproval of dicta, are often necessary. It is an unavoidable incident of the search by courts of last resort for the true rule. \n19\n The process of inclusion and exclusion, so often applied in developing a rule, cannot end with its first enunciation. The rule as announced must be deemed tentative. For the many and varying facts to which it will be applied cannot be foreseen. Modification implies growth. It is the life of the law.\n If the court is of opinion that this act of Congress is in necessary conflict with its recent decisions, those cases should be frankly overruled. The reasons for doing so are persuasive. Our experience in attempting to apply the rule, and helpful discussion by friends of the Court, have made it clear that the rule declared is legally unsound;20 that it disturbs legal principles \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 237]\n\u00a0\n long established; and that if adhered to, it will make a serious addition to the classes of cases which this court is required to review. \n21\n Experience and discussion have also made apparent how unfortunate are the results, economically and socially. It has, in part, frustrated a promising attempt to alleviate some of the misery, and remove some of the injustice, incident to the conduct of industry and commerce. These far- reaching and unfortunate results of the rule declared in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen cannot have been foreseen when the decision was rendered. If it is adhered to, appropriate legislative provision, urgently needed, cannot be made until another amendment of the Constitution shall have been adopted. For no federal workmen's compensation law could satisfy the verying and peculiar economic and social needs incident to the diversity of conditions in the several States. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n[264 U.S. 219, 238]\n\u00a0\n The doctrine of stare decisis should not deter us from overruling that case and those which follow it. The decisions are recent ones. They have not been acquiesced in. They have not created a rule of property around which vested interests have clustered. They affect solely matters of a transitory nature. On the other hand, they affect seriously the lives of men, women and children, and the general welfare. Stare decisis is ordinarily a wise rule of action. But it is not a universal, inexorable command. The instances in whcih the court has disregarded its admonition are many. \n23\n The existing admiralty jurisdiction rests, in large part, upon like action of the court in The Genesee Chief, 12 How. 443, 456. In that case the court overrrled The Thomas Jefferson, 10 Wheat. 428, and \n\n[264 U.S. 219, 239]\n\u00a0\n The Steamboat Orleans v. Phoebus, 11 Pet. 175; and a doctrine declared by Mr. Justice Story with the concurrence of Chief Justice Marshall, and approved by Chancellor Kent, was abandoned when found to be erroneous, although it had been acted on for 26 years. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That clause 3 of section 24 of the Judicial Code as hereby amended to read as follows: \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Third.

U.S.(1924)\nNo. 79\nArgued: October 16, 1924Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 226, 227]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. G. Wilson, J. M. Springer, Horace Speed, and Wm. H. Thompson, all of Tulsa, Okl., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. H. L. Underwood, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 226, 231]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Nathaniel Perryman, a Creek half-blood Indian, was allotted a homestead, with restrictions against alienation until April 26, 1931, subject, however, to removal, wholly or in part, by the Secretary of the Interior, 'under such rules and regulations concerning terms of sale and disposal of the proceeds for the benefit of the respective Indians as he may prescribe.' Act May 27, 1908,  1, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312. Upon application, the Secretary removed the restrictions from a portion of the homestead, which was then sold, the proceeds of the sale being retained by the Secretary. Subsequently a portion of the proceeds was used to purchase \n\n[266 U.S. 226, 232]\n\u00a0\n another tract of land (the subject of the present controversy), such purchase being authorized by the Secretary upon condition that the deed of conveyance contain a clause restricting the alienation of the land so purchased until April 26, 1931, 'unless made with the consent of and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.' The deed was made accordingly and duly recorded in the records of Tulsa county, Okl. Perryman, thereafter, without the consent of the Secretary, sold and conveyed the land to the appellant. A decree of an Oklahoma state court was obtained in a suit against Perryman, to which the United States was not a party, quieting title in appellant. The United States then brought this suit in the federal District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma to cancel and set aside the conveyance of the land to appellant and annul the decree of the state court. The District Court rendered a decree in favor of the United States, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 287 F. 468.\n Upon the appeal here, appellant does not seriously challenge the decree in so far as it annuls the decree of the state court (Bowling v. United States, \n233 U.S. 528\n, 534-535, 34 S. Ct. 659; Privett v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 201, 203\n, 41 S. Ct. 455 ), but confines his attack to that portion of the decree canceling the deed. The grounds relied upon are: (1) That Congress is without power to authorize the imposition of restrictions upon the sale of lands within a state which have passed to private ownership; (2) that Congress has not, in fact, conferred upon the Secretary such authority; and (3) that there is no competent, relevant or material evidence sufficient to support the decree of the trial court.\n First. The power of Congress is challenged upon the ground that the land had become subject to the jurisdiction of the state and was exclusively within the control of its laws. The general rule is not to be doubted, that the tenure, transfer, control and disposition of real property \n\n[266 U.S. 226, 233]\n\u00a0\n are matters which rest exclusively with the state where the property lies ( United States v. Fox, \n94 \nU.S. 315, 320\n, 321 S.), but it by no means follows that a restriction upon alienation, limited as it is here, may not be imposed by the United States as a condition upon which a purchase of private lands within the state will be made for an Indian ward. The question is argued as though there had been an actual invasion of or an interference with the authority of the state to regulate and condition the transfer of land within its boundaries. But there is no such invasion or interference. If Congress, in fulfillment of its duty to protect the Indians, whose welfare is the peculiar concern of the federal government, deems it proper to restrict for a limited time the right of the individual Indian to alienate land purchased for him with funds arising from the sale of other lands originally subject to a like restriction, we are not aware of anything which stands in the way. The state of Oklahoma is not concerned, since there is no state statute, rule of law or policy, which has been called to our attention, to the contrary effect. If there were, or if the power of state taxation were involved, we should consider the question of supremacy of power; but no such question is presented by this record.\n Nor are we called upon to determine whether a qualified and limited restraint upon the alienation of a fee-simple title, imposed by an ordinary grantor upon an ordinary grantee, would be valid, even though not offensive to the rule against perpetuities. However, that may be, we do not doubt the power of the United States to impose such a restraint upon the sale of the lands of its Indian wards, whether acquired by private purchase and generally subject to state control or not. Such power rests upon the dependent cahracter of the Indians, their recognized inability to safely conduct business affairs, and the \n\n[266 U.S. 226, 234]\n\u00a0\n peculiar duty of the federal government to safeguard their interests and protect them against the greed of others and their own improvidence. See and compare Libby v. Clark, \n118 \nU.S. 250, 255\n, 6 S. Ct. 1045; United States v. Paine Lumber Co., \n206 \nU.S. 467, 473\n, 27 S. Ct. 697; Blanset v. Cardin, \n256 \nU.S. 319, 326\n, 41 S. Ct. 519; Bunch v. Cole, \n263 \nU.S. 250, 252\n, 44 S. Ct. 101; Sperry Oil & Gas Co. v. Chisholm, \n264 \nU.S. 488, 493\n, 44 S. Ct. 372. And the power does not fall short of the need, but, so long as they remain wards of the Government, justifies the interposition of the strong shield of federal law to the end that they be not overreached or despoiled in respect of their property of whatsoever kind or nuture. United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 383\n, 385 S., 6 S. Ct. 1109.\n Second. The statute imposes the restriction upon the alienation of the Indian's allotted lands and this, it is said, precludes an extension of the restraint to lands purchased for him. The authority given the Secretary to remove such restrictions, under prescribed rules and regulations 'concerning the terms of sale and disposal of the proceeds for the benefit of the respective Indians,' it is further insisted, ends with the disposal of the proceeds and does not extend so far as to permit him to impose restrictions upon the alienation of land purchased with such proceeds. The Secretary did not construe the statute so narrowly, but, acting under it, among other rules, prescribed that:\n'Where lands are purchased for the use and benefit of any citizen of the Five Civilized Tribes, of the restricted class, payment for which is made from proceeds arising from the sale of restricted allotted lands ... the superintendent ... shall cause a conveyance of such lands to be made on a form of conveyance containing a habendum clause against alienation or encumbrance until April 26, 1931.'\n\n When the general protective policy of Congress in dealing with the Indians is borne in mind, it reasonably cannot \n\n[266 U.S. 226, 235]\n\u00a0\n be doubted that the authority conferred upon the Secretary to make rules concerning the 'disposal of the proceeds for the benefit of the respective Indians' is broad enough to justify the rule in question. Since the allotted lands could not be sold or encumbered without his consent, and since the proceeds of any sale thereof were subject to his control and could only be disposed of with his approval and under such rules as he might prescribe for the benefit of the respective Indians, the extension of such control to the property in which the proceeds were directly invested would seem to be within the statute fairly construed. Indeed, we think the authority of the Secretary to withhold his consent to the proposed investment of the proceeds subject to his control, includes the lesser authority to allow the investment upon condition that the property into which the proceeds are converted shall be impressed with a like control. See United States v. Law, 250 F. 218, 162 C. C. A. 354; United States v. Thurston County, 143 F. 287, 290-291, 74 C. C. A. 425; National Bank of Commerce v. Anderson, 147 F. 87, 90, 77 C. C. A. 259. It is unnecessary to review the decisions said by appellant to justify the contrary conclusion. Upon examination they are all found to be readily differentiated from the case under consideration.\n Third. The only suggestion contained in appellant's brief which seriously relates to the sufficiency of the evidence, is that the proof fails to establish that the Secretary imposed restrictions specifically upon the sale of the land in question. There was received in evidence a telegram from the Department, purporting to grant authority to purchase the land for Perryman and directing the use of 'a restricted form of deed.' We are unable to see how this could have referred to anything else than the requirement of the rule heretofore quoted. It is said further that the telegram was not recorded in any office so as to \n\n[266 U.S. 226, 236]\n\u00a0\n give constructive notice to appellant or the public. It was not necessary that it should have been. The conveyance made by its authority, embodying the restriction required by the rule, was recorded, and that was enough. The remainder of appellant's brief under this head resolves itself into a mere challenge of the competency or relevancy of certain documentary evidence, including the telegram just mentioned, admitted, over objection, by the trial court. The assignment of errors contains no suggestion that the erroneous admission of evidence would be relied upon. The rulings of the court, therefore, admitting such evidence are not before us.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUPREME LODGE K P v.

Prior to the effective date of the new rates the assured had paid all dues assessed under the old rates. After such date he refused to pay at the new rates, upon the ground, among others, that in disregard of a state statute the society was not operating under a representative form of government when the rates were increased; but he regularly and duly tendered payment at the old rates. \n\n[265 U.S. 30, 32]\n\u00a0\n Section 4 of the congressional act provides:\n'That said corporation shall have a constitution, and shall have power to amend the same at pleasure: Provided, that such constitution or amendments thereof do not conflict with the laws of the United States or of any state.'\n\n A statute of Nebraska in force at the time the new rates were adopted defines a fraternal benefit society as a corporation, etc., organized and carried on for the sole benefit of its members and their beneficiaries and not for profit, and provides:\n'Each such society shall have a lodge system, with ritualistic form of work and representative form of government.' Laws of 1897, p. 266, c. 47,  1.\n\n According to the stipulation of facts, the Supreme Lodge when it made the amendment increasing rates, 'was composed of 163 members and that of such members 9 were Past Supreme Chancellors, 8 were Supreme Officers of the defendant, 98 were holders of certificates in the Insurance Department, and 146 were delegates elected by the various Grand Lodges within the order,' all of whom participated in enacting the amendment. On the first appeal, the state Supreme Court, after a full discussion of the question and of the facts, and a review of its earlier decisions, held that the body above described did not constitute a representative form of government, within the meaning of the state statute. 104 Neb. 505, 177 N. W. 828. Upon rehearing the court adhered to this conclusion, 104 Neb. 511, 180 N. W. 579; and, upon the second appeal, again affirmed it, 189 N. W. 839.\n Under the settled rule of this court, declared so frequently and uniformly as to have become axiomatic, we must accept this decision of the highest court of the state fixing the meaning of the state legislation, as though such meaning had been specifically expressed therein. See, for example, Leffingwell v. Warren, 2 Black, 599, 603; Green v. Lessee of Neal, 6 Pet. 291, 297-300. And we follow \n\n[265 U.S. 30, 33]\n\u00a0\n the state construction, even though it may not agree with our own opinion. Supervisors v. United States, 18 Wall. 71, 82.1 Shelby v. Guy, 11 Wheat. 361, 367; Tioga R. R. v. Blossburg & Corning R. R., 20 Wall. 137, 143. No question is raised as to the necessity for compliance with the provisions of the state statute; but the defense pleaded and relied upon is that the matter was concluded by a decree of the federal District Court of Indiana, affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Holt v. Supreme Lodge Knights of Pythias, 235 Fed. 885, 149 C. C. A. 197, establishing the validity and enforceability of the increased rates; that such decree was binding, as res adjudicata, upon Meyer, the plaintiff; and that the court below, in declining to so consider it, denied full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of another state, in contravention of article 4,  1, of the Constitution of the United States, and of section 905, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1519).\n While the judicial proceedings of the federal courts are not within the terms of the constitutional provision, such proceedings, nevertheless, must be accorded the same full faith and credit by state courts as would be required in respect of the judicial proceedings of another state. Hancock National Bank v. Farnum, \n176 \nU.S. 640, 644\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 506; Embry v. Palmer, \n107 \nU.S. 3, 9\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 25. It appears from the record in the Holt Case, which was in evidence and is in the record here, that the court expressly found that the society was, during its entire existence, operating under a representative form of government. We assume, for present purposes, that the plaintiff is bound by that decree; but the question-and the vital question-still remains, is the issue the same? We are of the opinion that it is not the same, and that the plea of res adjudicata fails.\n The principal place of business of the order was in Indiana; and the question presented in the Holt Case, which was brought in Indiana, evidently was whether \n\n[265 U.S. 30, 34]\n\u00a0\n there was a representative form of government within the meaning of the statute of that state (section 5043; 2 Burns' Indiana Stats. 1914, p. 882), since the federal statute made no requirement on the subject, and the finding, unless to satisfy the Indiana law, would have been meaningless. The question of compliance with the statute of Nebraska or those of other states was not involved. The Indiana statute is reproduced in the margin,2 and, as will be seen, differs from the Nebraska statute, in that the former specifically defines what shall constitute a representative form of government, while the latter does not. But if we assume, for the moment, that the two statutes are alike, nevertheless, our determination must be the same. It was within the competency of the federal court to construe the Indiana statute in one way, and it was equally within the competency of the Nebraska Supreme Court to construe the Nebraska statute in an opposite way; and, since the construction becomes part of the statute and is to be read as though in its text, in the one case as in the other, the result is that they are, in effect, not the same, but different \n\n[265 U.S. 30, 35]\n\u00a0\n statutes. In Christy v. Pridgeon, 4 Wall. 196, 203 (18 L. Ed. 322) this court said:\n'Nor does it matter that in the courts of other states, carved out of territory since acquired from Mexico, a different interpretation may have been adopted. If such be the case, the courts of the United States will, in conformity with the same principles, follow the different ruling so far as it affects titles in those states. The interpretation within the jurisdiction of one state becomes a part of the law of that state, as much so as if incorporated into the body of it by the Legislature. If, therefore, different interpretations are given in different states to a similar local law, that law in effect becomes by the interpretations, so far as it is a rule for our action, a different law in one state from what it is in the other.'\n\n In Louisiana v. Pilsbury, \n105 U.S. 278\n, 294 (26 L. Ed. 1090) it was said:\n'So far does this doctrine extend that, when a statute of two states, expressed in the same terms, is construed differently by the highest courts, they are treated by us as different laws, each embodying the particular construction of its own state, and enforced in accordance with it in all cases arising under it.'\n\n See Shelby v. Guy, supra; May v. Tenney, \n148 U.S. 60\n, 64 13 Sup. Ct. 491; Detroit v. Osborne, \n135 \nU.S. 492, 498\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 1012; Chicago Union Bank v. Kansas City Bank, \n136 \nU.S. 223, 235\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 1013.\n It follows that there is not identity of issue in the two cases, since, so far as this court is concerned, the statutes which determine it are of exactly opposite import. In principle, it is the same as though the Indiana statute, which controlled the question decided in the first suit, had been superseded by a later Indiana enactment to the contrary effect, and a second suit, arising under and controlled by the later enactment, was brought, involving the same question. The intervention of the new and antagonistic statute in either case furnishes a new basis for the litigation, and the issue is no longer the same. Memphis City Bank v. Tennessee, \n161 U.S. 186\n, \n\n[265 U.S. 30, 36]\n\u00a0\n 192, 16 Sup. Ct. 468; Utter v. Franklin, \n172 \nU.S. 416, 424\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 183; Erskine v. Steele County (C. C.) 87 Fed. 630, 636; affirmed 98 Fed. 215, 220, 39 C. C. A. 173.\n Prior decisions of this court are pressed upon our attention, of which Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, v. Mims, \n241 U.S. 574\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 702, L. R. A. 1916F, 919, and Supreme Council of the Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 U.S. 531\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 724, L. R. A. 1916A, 771, are examples. They are not in point. Neither the effect of state statutes imposing conditions like the one here under review, nor the question in respect of identity of issue, upon which the plea of res adjudicata in the present case turns, was involved or considered.\n Under section 709 Revised Statutes (Judicial Code,  237; Comp. St  1214), this case would be properly here upon writ of error, Pittsburg, etc ., Ry. Co. v. Long Island Loan & Trust Co., \n172 \nU.S. 493, 508\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 238; Hancock National Bank v. Farnum, supra; Embry v. Palmer, supra; but, as amended by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, the remedy is by certiorari. We therefore dismiss the writ of error, grant the petition for certiorari, Yazoo & M. V. R. R. Co. v. Clarksdale, \n257 U.S. 10\n, 15-16, 42 Sup. Ct. 27, and, for the reasons given above, affirm the judgment of the state Supreme Court.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS:\n Claiming as beneficiary, Meyer brought an action upon a policy issued by the Supreme Lodge in the district court, Otoe county, Neb.\n The declaration alleges:\n'That the defendant is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a fraternal order or organization maintaining a life insurance department for its members, organized and existing under an act of the United States Congress, in the District of Columbia, and having its principal offices and place of business in the city of Indianapolis, in the state of Indiana, and duly authorized to transact its business in the state of Nebraska. That on and prior to the 11th day of June, 1885, \n\n[265 U.S. 30, 37]\n\u00a0\n Louis J. Meyer, a resident of Otoe county, Nebraska, was a member of a subordinate lodge of the defendant, and on said date the said defendant issued and delivered to the said Louis J. Meyer in Otoe county, Nebraska, its membership certificate No. 4651, by the terms of which it insured the life of the said Louis J. Meyer in the sum of $ 2,000, and agreed in the event of his death to pay that sum to a beneficiary therein named. That on or about the 31st of May, 1910, the said Louis J. Meyer surrendered said certificate to the defendant for the sole purpose of changing the beneficiary therein named, and thereafter the defendant issued in lieu thereof to the said Louis J. Meyer its certificate of membership dated June 30, 1910, numbered 4651, insuring the life of the said Louis J. Meyer in the sum of $2, 000, by the terms of which the defendant agreed that in the event of the death of the said Louis J. Meyer to pay to George O. Meyer, this plaintiff, the sum of $2,000, a copy of which membership certificate is hereto attached, marked Exhibit A, and made a part thereof.'\n\n And further that the assured died April 11, 1916, after performing all things required of him.\n Certificate No. 4651-Exhibit A-recites that Louis J. Meyer had been accepted as a member of the insurance department and the Supreme Lodge promised to pay the designated beneficiary two thousand dollars, subject to certain conditions and payment of $5.70 each month. Also:\n'The member holding this certificate shall make all monthly payments as they may be due from him, and also make any extra or special monthly payments required from him. ... His rate of contribution hereunder may be changed, increased or adjusted at any time in accordance with the laws of this society when deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of the insurance department.'\n\n The defense was that by a duly adopted rule, or law, the Supreme Lodge had increased the monthly rates for \n\n[265 U.S. 30, 38]\n\u00a0\n the time subsequent to January 1, 1911, and assured had refused to pay them.\n The act of Congress which incorporated the Supreme Lodge among other things provided:\n'That said corporation shall have a constitution, and shall have power to amend the same at pleasure: Provided, that such constitution or amendments thereof do not conflict with the laws of the United States or of any state.' Act of June 29, 1894, c. 119, 28 Stat. 96, 97.\n\n Under this federal charter it might amend its statutes, or by-laws, and the change of rates was effective unless prohibited by statute as to Nebraska members. The obligation of the contract between the lodge and the assured presents a question of federal law. Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 U.S. 531\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 724, L. R. A. 1916A, 771; Hartford Life Insurance Co. v. Ibs, \n237 U.S. 662\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 692, L. R. A. 1916A, 765; Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, v. Mims, \n241 U.S. 574\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 702, L. R. A. 1916F, 919. This is plain under the last-cited case, which reviewed and reversed the judgment of the Texas court denying the validiy of the bylaw here questioned.\n The court below held that, under chapter 47, General Laws of Nebraska 1897, the action of the Supreme Lodge in undertaking to increase rates was without effect because the association did not have a 'representative form of government.' And this makes it necessary to inquire whether that act is fairly susceptible of the construction adopted by the state court. Generally this court accepts the construction of a local statute approved by the state court of last resort, but the rule does not apply where this is fanciful and amounts to a mere subterfuge. Leathe v. Thomas, \n207 \nU.S. 93, 99\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 30; Vandalia Railroad v. South Bend, \n207 \nU.S. 359, 367\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 130; Enterprise Irrigation District v. Canal Co., \n243 \nU.S. 157, 164\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 318; Superior Water Co. v. Superior, \n263 \nU.S. 125, 136\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 82, 68 L. Ed. --.\n Chapter 47 contains 24 sections. The first declares:\n'A fraternal beneficiary association is hereby \n\n[265 U.S. 30, 39]\n\u00a0\n declared to be a corporation, society or voluntary association, formed or organized and carried on for the sole benefit of its members and their beneficiaries, and not for profit. Each such society shall have a lodge system, with ritualistic form of work and representative form of government.'\n\n The remaining sections relate to the organization and government of domestic corporations and provide for reports by and the licensing and duties of such corporations when organized in other states. Section 16:\n'Any such association refusing or neglecting to make the report as provided in this act shall be excluded from doing business within this state. The auditor of public accounts must, within sixty days after the failure to make such report, or in case any such society shall exceed its powers, or shall conduct its business fraudulently, or shall fail to comply with any of the provisions of this act, give notice in writing to the Attorney General, who shall immediately commence an action against such society to enjoin the same from carrying on any business. ...'\n\n There is nothing in the act which excludes an association with a government like that of plaintiff in error. It does not undertake to invalidate contracts of such companies after licenses have been issued to them. Nor do I find that the laws of the state inhibited the auditor from licensing an association with a nonrepresentative form of government.\n It is stipulated and agreed:\n'That the defendant [plaintiff in error] is a fraternal order or organization, maintaining a life insurance department for its members, existing under an act of the United States Congress in the District of Columbia, having its principal place of business in the city of Indianapolis and state of Indiana, and authorized to transact business in the state of Nebraska during the period covered by the pleadings in this case.'\n\n With knowledge of its form of government, the duly designated official licensed it to do business within the state. \n\n[265 U.S. 30, 40]\n\u00a0\n Attributing a fanciful meaning to the term 'representative form of government,' the court below declared that the challenged by-law was not adopted as required by the Nebraska statute and therefore was without force within that state. This was the excuse offered for annulling an agreement entered into by an association incorporated under federal law and duly licensed by the state.\n A view of the statute is enough to show that it did not undertake to prescribe rules for the internal government of foreign corporations licensed to do business within the state or to control agreements between such corporations and their members.\n Moreover, it seems impossible reasonably to conclude that plaintiff in error had no 'representative form of government' because a few officers, by virtue of their positions, constituted a small minority (10 per cent.) of the lawmaking body, otherwise composed of elected representatives. And certainly the conclusion of the court is not strengthened by the opinion, which advances the following as the reason therefor:\n'To retain the exercise of governmental authority in the hands of the people is the modern trend. Extended argument is not needed to establish this fact. Witness the election of United States senators by direct vote, the direct primary, and the initiative and referendum. Fraternal societies are no exception to the rule.'\n\n In the circumstances, I think we should refuse to accept a ruling so obviously contrary to reason, treat it as a mere subterfuge, and hold that under Knights of Pythias v. Mims, supra, the rates were properly increased, and by failing to pay them the assured surrendered all rights under the policy. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 21 L.

WASHINGTON WATER POWER CO.(1924)\nNo. 142\nArgued: February 21, 1924Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 322, 323]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James F. Ailshie, of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, for appellants.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank T. Post, of Spokane, Wash., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee is a corporation engaged in the generation and distribution of electrical energy in Washington and Idaho. It has a high tension power transmission line extending from Spokane, Washington, to Burke, Idaho, in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District. The line was constructed in 1902 and 1903. A portion of it was located across certain \n\n[265 U.S. 322, 326]\n\u00a0\n lands then unsurveyed and constituting a part of the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation. Telephone wires were strung on the poles carrying the power line for use in connection with the operation and maintenance of that line. And there was constructed a patrol road necessary for the maintenance of the power line. Ever since its construction, the power line has been used to furnish electrical energy in that district.\n July 7, 1902, the Secretary of the Interior under authority of the Act of February 15, 1901, c. 372, 31 Stat. 790 (Comp. St.  4946), granted appellee a permit for the use of a right of way upon which to construct and maintain the power line through the reservation; and about the same time, he granted appellee a right of way for the construction and operation of a telephone line through the reservation, under authority of the Act of March 3, 1901, c. 832, 31 Stat. 1083,  3 (Comp. St.  4191).\n An Act of Congress of June 21, 1906, c. 3504, 34 Stat. 335, provided for the allotment of lands within the reservation to members of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, and authorized the opening to settlement and entry of the lands remaining undisposed of. Pursuant to the President's proclamation, this was done in May, 1910. Appellants respectively made homestead entries of certain of those lands across which the power line had been constructed, and later received patents therefor. \n1\n The patents are absolute in form and contain no exception or reservation in respect of the power line or privileges granted appellee. The appellants, denying the right of appellee after patents to operate and maintain the power line across the lands described in their patents, interfered with and threatened to prevent its use. Appellee brought a suit in the United \n\n[265 U.S. 322, 327]\n\u00a0\n States District Court for Idaho against each of the appellants to enjoin such interference, and to have it decreed that the patents did not revoke or affect the permits, and that they are in full force and effect. Jurisdiction was invoked on the ground that the suits arose under the laws of the United States above referred to. The four cases were tried together. The District Court granted appellee the relief prayed. Its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 281 Fed. 900. The case is here on appeal under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218).\n The question to be decided is whether, as to the lands described therein, the patents issued to appellants revoked or canceled the permits theretofore granted to appellee by the Secretary.\n The Act of March 3, 1901, 31 Stat. 1083, relating to rights of way for the construction of telephone lines does not apply. The telephone wires are used only in connection with the operation and maintenance of the power line. Appellee's rights are to be determined under the Act of February 15, 1901. Its material provisions are:\n'That the Secretary of the Interior be, and hereby is, authorized and empowered, under general regulations to be fixed by him, to permit the use of rights of way through the public lands, forest and other reservations of the United States, and the Yosemite, Sequoia, and General Grant National Parks, California, for electrical plants, poles, and lines for the generation and distribution of electrical power, and for telephone and telegraph purposes, and for canals, ditches, pipes and pipe lines, flumes, tunnels, or other water conduits, and for water plants, dams, and reservoirs used to promote irrigation or mining or quarrying, or the manufacturing or cutting of timber or lumber, or the supplying of water for domestic, public, or any other beneficial uses to the extent of the ground occupied by such canals, ditches, flumes, tunnels, reservoirs, or other water conduits or water plants, or electrical \n\n[265 U.S. 322, 328]\n\u00a0\n or other works permitted hereunder, and not to exceed fifty feet on each side of the marginal limits thereof, or not to exceed fifty feet on each side of the center line of such pipes and pipe lines, electrical, telegraph, and telephone lines and poles, by any citizen, association, or corporation of the United States, where it is intended by such to exercise the use permitted hereunder or [for] any one or more of the purposes herein named: ... And provided further, that any permission given by the Secretary of the Interior under the provisions of this act may be revoked by him or his successor in his discretion, and shall not be held to confer any right, or easement, or interest in, to, or over any public land, reservation, or park.'\n\n When the homestead entries were made by appellants, the regulation of July 8, 1901, was in force. Paragraph 11 (31 L. D. 17) contains the following:\n'The final disposal by the United States of any tract traversed by the permitted right of way is of itself, without further act on the part of the department, a revocation of the permission so far as it affects that tract, and any permission granted hereunder is also subject to such further and future regulations as may be adopted by the department.'\n\n August 24, 1912, before the patents were issued, this provision was superseded by the following regulation (41 L. D. 152, par. 9):\n'The final disposal by the United States of any tract traversed by a right of way permitted under this act shall not be construed to be a revocation of such permission in whole or in part, but such final disposal shall be deemed and taken to be subject to such right of way until such permission shall have been specifically revoked in accordance with the provisions of said act.'\n\n At the same time, the Secretary by regulation required that all patents issued have on their face a notation of prior permits. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[265 U.S. 322, 329]\n\u00a0\n It was competent for Congress to make subsequent homestead entries subject to the Act of February 15, 1901, and to the regulations fixed by the Secretary. And undoubtedly the power and authority of the Secretary under the act may be so exercised as to affect the rights and limit the title of subsequent homestead entrymen. Within the scope of the authorization, he may make, and from time to time change, regulations for the administration of the act. The rights of appellants as entrymen were subject to the proper exercise of that power. The regulation in effect when appellants settled on the land expressly provided that permissions granted were subject to further and future regulation. At that time, the right of way was occupied and used for the operation of the power line. When the patents issued, that regulation had been superseded by the one of August 24, 1912\n\n\n Appellants contend that appellee acquired a mere license temporarily to use the right of way through the lands in question, and that the patents without more revoked the license and deprived appellee of its right of way over the lands therein described. In support of this contention, they stress the concluding clause of the act, stating that the permission given 'shall not be held to confer any right or easement or interest in, to, or over any public land, reservation, or park.' The purpose of the act is to grant to the Secretary power 'to permit the use of rights of way' through the lands referred to. And, in order that control over them may be retained, it is provided that the Secretary in his discretion may revoke such permits. The enterprises mentioned in the act involve expensive and permanent construction. The use of land necessary for the undertakings specified is to be distinguished from mere licenses to travel over, graze cattle on, or otherwise use or occupy land without investment for construction or improvements. Plainly, the piecemeal revocation of the right of way, whenever a patent is \n\n[265 U.S. 322, 330]\n\u00a0\n issued to a settler along the line, would increase the financial burden and add elements of risk to the investments, and so be inconsistent with the purpose of the act. The clause above quoted should be read to promote and advance, not to defeat, the legislative purpose to permit the use of rights of way through public lands for the industries and utilities mentioned. It is included from an abundance of caution to support and safeguard the Secretary's power of revocation. It means that the permissions given shall not be deemed to confer any right that may not be revoked by him in the exercise of his discretion. There is no other enactment providing for the termination of the use of the rights of way. The right to use continues until the permission given by the Secretary is revoked by him.\n As the sole power of revocation was committed to his discretion, it was within the power of the Secretary to determine that final disposal of the lands would operate to revoke the permission; and it was also within his power, by the regulation of August 24, 1912, to declare that final disposal shall not be deemed to be a revocation, but shall be subject to the right of way until such permission shall have been specifically revoked. Upon elaborate consideration, in 1912, the Secretary held that the provision of the regulation first above quoted was directly contrary to the purpose of the statute. He said:\n'It discouraged development by making the title of the permittee subject to that of the final patentee of the land occupied under the permit. ... To effectuate the purpose of the statute it is necessary that a permit once given should be superior to the rights of the subsequent patentee of the land until such time as the permit is duly revoked by the Secretary of the Interior in the exercise of the express authority given by the statute. ... The regulations hereinbefore made [41 L. D., supra] will protect permittees from any demands that might \n\n[265 U.S. 322, 331]\n\u00a0\n otherwise be made upon them by subsequent claimants of the lands over which the permits give a right of way.' Letter of August 23, 1912, from the Secretary of the Interior to the Commissioner of the General Land Office.\n\n The regulation is still in effect. The construction and application of the act so made and provided for have been followed since that time. If the meaning of the act were not otherwise plain, this interpretation would be a useful guide to the ascertainment of the legislative intention. It is a 'settled rule that the practical interpretation of an ambiguous or uncertain statute by the executive department charged with its administration is entitled to the highest respect, and, if acted upon for a number of years, will not be disturbed except for very cogent reasons.' Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 685, 690 (58 L. Ed. 1121).\n Appellants contend, and it is true as a general rule, that when, conformably to the laws, entry is made and certificate given, the land covered ceased to be a part of the public lands (Witherspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wall. 210, 219), and that, when a patent issues in accordance with governing statutes, all title and control of the land passes from the United States (United States v. Schurz, \n102 U.S. 378\n, 396). But we hold that, under the act and the regulation made pursuant to it and in force when the patents issued, these rules do not operate to strike down rights, subject to which, under the law, the lands are patented. Under the permission of the Secretary, the power line had been constructed and was maintained on the right of way over the lands in question for a long time before the reservation was opened for settlement. The entries were made subject to the regulations then in force, and were affected by the provision 'that any permission granted hereunder is also subject to such further and future regulations as may be adopted by the department.' The fact that the patents did not have thereon a notation of the prior permit \n\n[265 U.S. 322, 332]\n\u00a0\n is not controlling. Under the regulation then in force, final disposal did not revoke the permit, but was made subject to the use of the right of way for the power line. It was intended that the patent should not extinguish the earlier permission given by the Secretary. The issuing of the patents without a reservation did not convey what the law reserved. They are to be given effect according to the laws and regulations under which they were issued. See Stoddard v. Chambers, 2 How. 284, 318; Jamestown & Northern Rd. Co. v.

FOX(1924)\nNo. 188\nArgued: Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Elkan Turk, of New York City, and Frank J. Hogan, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. David W. Kahn and Irving L. Ernst, both of New York City for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDELS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Company, Inc., recovered, in the Supreme Court of the state of New York, a judgment against Cowen Hosiery Company, Inc. Execution thereon was levied upon personal property of the defendant lying upon \n\n[264 U.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n premises occupied by it. The levy created a lien upon the property. New York Civil Practice Act,  679. The sheriff took, and thereafter retained, exclusive possession and control of the property. Within four months of the date of the levy, the Cowen Company filed, in the Southern District of New York, a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and was adjudged a bankrupt. Relying upon subdivision 'f'1 of section 67 of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9651), the trustees sought, by a summary proceeding before the referee, to have the lien on execution declared void and to obtain possession of the property. The referee ordered that the judgment creditor show cause before him why this should not be done. Before the District Court the judgment creditor seasonably challenged the jurisdiction of the referee and of the bankruptcy court, furnished substantial support for its claim that the debtor was solvent at the date of the entry of judgment and levy of execution thereon, and insisted that, since the bankrupt did not have, and the bankruptcy court did not acquire, possession of the property, the execution lien and the right to possession under \n\n[264 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n the levy could not be assailed by the trustees, except by a plenary suit in the appropriate forum. The trustees, on the other hand, urged that the referee had jurisdiction, even if the adverse claim by the judgment creditor be deemed a substantial one. The District Court sustained the contention of the judgment creditor and stayed the proceeding before the referee. Upon a petition to revise, its order was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 286 Fed. 351. The case is here on writ of certiorari. \n260 U.S. 719\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 250.\n A trustee seeking to have declared void, under subdivision 'f' of section 67, a lien obtained through legal proceedings, and to recover possession of property, may be confronted with an adverse claim upon several grounds. It may be asserted that the lien attacked is of a character different from those provided for in that subdivision;2 or, although the lien (i. e., that obtained by levy of execution) is clearly one to which subdivision 'f' applies, that it is valid by reason of other facts, for the statute does not, as a matter of substantive law, declare void every lien obtained through legal proceedings within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. The lien may be valid, because the debtor was, in fact, solvent at the time the levy was made;3 or, although the debtor \n\n[264 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n was then insolvent, because the property had passed into the hands of a bona fide purchaser;4 or, although the debtor was then insolvent and the levy was made within the four months, because inchoate rights by way of lien had been acquired earlier. \n5\n As the establishment of any one of these facts would bar recovery by the trustee, their assertion presents a judicial question. In this case, since the possession of the sheriff was the possession of the state court, the trustees' claim to the property would, under general principles of law, have to be litigated in the state court. \n6\n The question for decision is: Has Congress conferred upon the bankruptcy court, under these circumstances, jurisdiction to adjudicate the controverted rights by summary proceedings?\n Congress has, of course, power to confer upon the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to adjudicate the rights of trustees to property adversely claimed. In matters relating to bankruptcy its power is paramount. \n7\n Hence, even if the property is not within the possession of the bankruptcy court, Congress can confer upon it, as upon any other lower federal court, jurisdiction of the controversy, by conferring jurisdiction over the person in \n\n[264 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n whose possession the property is. Congress has, also (subject to the constitutional guaranties), power to determine to what extent jurisdiction conferred, whether through possession of the res or otherwise, shall be exercised by summary proceedings and to what extent by plenary suit. \n8\n But Congress did not, either by section 2, section 23 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 (Comp. St.  9586, 9607), or any other provision of the act, confer generally such broad jurisdiction over claims by a trustee against third persons. \n9\n Nor has it provided in terms, that a substantial adverse claim to property which is not in the possession of the bankruptcy court, and which is demanded by the trustee under subdivision 'f' of section 67, may be litigated, without consent, by a summary proceeding. To sustain the judgment under review, a specific grant of power to so deal with such a controversy must be shown. The contention is that a specific grant of the power is implied in a clause contained in subdivision 'f.' Before examining the clause, it will be helpful to consider the rules, established by decisions of this court, governing like proceedings under provisions of the Bankruptcy Act cognate to subdivision 'f' of section 67.\n The Bankruptcy Act provides, in subdivision 'e' of section 67, in subdivision 'b' of section 60 (Comp. St.  9644) and in subdivision 'e' of section 70 (Comp. St.  9654), for the recovery by the trustee of property formerly belonging \n\n[264 U.S. 426, 432]\n\u00a0\n to the bankrupt and which, within four months of the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy, had been subjected, in some manner, to a lien. The substantive rights of the trustee under these provisions differ according to the nature of the lien or of the infirmity therein. Under subdivision 'e' of section 67, where the lien was created in pais, it is voidable if it was made, within the four months, with the intent to hinder and defraud creditors, or if, within that period, it was made while insolvent under such circumstances that, under the laws of the state where the property is situated, it is void as to creditors. Under subdivision 'b' of section 60, the lien is voidable, whether it was created in pais or through legal proceedings, if it was created within the four months while the debtor was insolvent and the effect of its enforcement would be to give a preference. Under subdivision 'e' of section 70, a lien, however created, although not within the four months, is voidable by the trustee, if any creditor of the bankrupt might have avoided it. But the adjective rights of the trustee to litigate in the bankruptcy court claims incident to the lien were the same under these differing provisions.\n By the act of 1898 as originally enacted, the power of the bankruptcy court to adjudicate, without consent, controversies concerning the title, arising under either section 67e or section 60b, or section 70e, was confined to property of which it had possession. The possession, which was thus essential to jurisdiction, need not be actual. Constructive possession is sufficient. It exists where the property was in the physical possession of the debtor at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, but was not delivered by him to the trustee;10 where the property was delivered to the trustee, but was there after wrongfully withdrawn from \n\n[264 U.S. 426, 433]\n\u00a0\n his custody;11 where the property is in the hands of the bankrupt's agent or bailee;12 where the property is held by some other person who makes no claim to it;13 and where the property is held by one who makes a claim, but the claim is colorable only. \n14\n As every court must have power to determine, in the first instance, whether it has jurisdiction to proceed, the bankruptcy court has, in every case, jurisdiction to determine whether it has possession actual or constructive. \n15\n It may conclude, where it lacks actual possession, that the physical possession held by some other persons is of such a nature that the property is constructively within the possession of the court. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Wherever the bankruptcy court had possession, it could, under the act of 1898, as originally enacted, and can now, determine in a summary proceeding controversies involving substantial adverse claims of title under subdivision 'e' of section 67, under subdivision 'b' of section 60 and under subdivision 'e' of section 70.17 But, in no case where it lacked possession, \n\n[264 U.S. 426, 434]\n\u00a0\n could the bankruptcy court, under the law as originally enacted, nor can it now (without consent) adjudicate in a summary proceeding the validity of a substantial adverse claim. \n18\n In the absence of possession, there was under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, as originally passed, no jurisdiction, without consent, to adjudicate the controversy even by a plenary suit. \n19\n The Act of February 5, 1903, c. 487,  8, 32 Stat. 797, 798, 800, together with the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 412,  7, 36 Stat. 838, 840 (Comp. St.  9607), conferred upon the bankruptcy court jurisdiction, under certain circumstances, against the adverse claimant, in a plenary suit under section 60, subdivision 'b,' section 67, subdivision 'e,' and section 70, subdivision 'e.' But no amendment has conferred upon the bankruptcy court jurisdiction, even in a plenary suit, of proceedings under subdivision 'f' of section 67.\n The controversy presented when a trustee proceeding under subdivision 'f' of section 67 is confronted with a substantial adverse claim to property not in his possession, does not differ in character from that presented by like proceedings under the other sections discussed. No reason is suggested why the act of 1898 should have granted to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction in cases arising under section 67, subdivision 'f,' while it did not in like cases arising under these other provisions. Nor is any reason suggested why Congress should have granted by that act power to adjudicate the controversy arising under subdivision 'f' of section 67 in \n\n[264 U.S. 426, 435]\n\u00a0\n a summary proceeding, while it has never permitted a like controversy arising under any of the other provisions discussed above to be dealt with otherwise than in a plenary suit. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n The contention that Congress did confer upon the bankruptcy court the exceptional jurisdiction to determine in a summary proceeding substantial adverse claims arising under subdivision 'f,' concerning the title and possession of property not in its possession, rests wholly on the following clause of that subdivision:\n'The property affected by the levy [held void] shall pass to the trustee as a part of the estate of the bankrupt, unless the court shall, on due notice, order that the right under such levy ... shall be preserved by the trustee for the benefit of the estate as aforesaid. And the court may order such conveyance as shall be necessary to carry the purposes of this section into effect.'\n\n The argument is that, since the bankruptcy court is expressly empowered to order that a lien void as against the trustee shall be preserved for the benefit of the estate, it was given, by implication, jurisdiction to determine whether the lien is void. The argument proceeds upon a misapprehension of the nature and purpose of the clause in question. It does not confer jurisdiction. It confers substantive and adjective rights. Its grant of substantive rights, effected by means of subrogation, is a grant of property interests which the bankrupt did not own at the \n\n[264 U.S. 426, 436]\n\u00a0\n time of filing the petition. \n21\n Thus, an execution lien upon property, owned by the debtor at the time of the levy and good as against a subsequent purchaser but void as against the trustee under subdivision 'f,' may be preserved for the benefit of the estate. If the lien were not so preserved, the benefit resulting from nullifying it would enure to the purchaser. Subrogation is the process by which this substantive right is made available. \n22\n Where the bankrupt remained owner of the property until the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings and the void lien remained the only incumbrance on the property, there is no need of preserving it. But in such a case it may be desirable to invoke the strictly adjective powers conferred by the clause, and to apply for an order that a release or conveyance be made so as to remove a could upon title. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n The substantive right of subrogation which the clause confers can come into effect only after the invalidity of the lien as against the trustee has been established either by an admission of the holder of the lien or by an adjudication. It is entirely immaterial, so far as concerns the enjoyment of the right of subrogation, in which of \n\n[264 U.S. 426, 437]\n\u00a0\n these ways the invalidity is established. It is entirely immaterial, whether it is established by an adjudication, whether it be that of a state court, the bankruptcy court, or of the federal District Court sitting at law or equity. In every case in this court in which this right to subrogation has been exercised (and in most cases in the lower courts), 24 following an adjudication of invalidity made by the bankruptcy court, there had been either consent that jurisdiction be taken for that purpose 25 or there was possession of the res by that court. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n[264 U.S. 426, 438]\n\u00a0\n In this case, the sheriff had, before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, taken exclusive possession and control of the property, and he had retained such possession and control after adjudication and the appointment of the trustees. \n27\n The bankruptcy court, therefore, did not have actual possession of the res. The adverse claim of the judgment creditor was a substantial one. The bankruptcy court, therefore, did not have constructive possession of the res. Neither the judgment creditor, nor the sheriff, had become a party to the bankruptcy proceedings. \n28\n There was no consent to the adjudication by the bankruptcy court of the adverse claim. The objection to the jurisdiction was seasonably made and was insisted upon throughout. The bankruptcy court, therefore, did not acquire jurisdiction over the controversy in summary proceedings. Nor did it otherwise.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'f.

Hocker, all of St. Louis, Mo., for appellees.\n\n\n[266 U.S. 17, 23]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In November, 1905, the United States filed complaint in the Circuit ( now District) Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, two bridge companies, and a ferry company, subsidiaries of the association, certain railroad companies which owned the capital stock of the association, and the individuals who represented the shareholders on the board of directors of the association. The names of the defendants are given in a note printed in the margin of the opinion in United States v. St. Louis Terminal, \n224 \nU.S. 383, 390\n, 32 S. Ct. 507. The complaint alleged a combination in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830), and prayed a dissolution of the association. Under the Expedition Act of February 11, 1903, c. 544, 32 Stat. 823 (Comp. St.  8824, 8825), four Circuit Judges heard the case and entered a decree dismissing the complaint. On appeal to this court, there was a reversal. The case was remanded, and, March 2, 1914, a final decree was entered in the District Court in favor of the United States, in accordance with the mandate of this court. United States v. St. Louis Terminal, supra, 411, ( 32 S. Ct. 507). See also Ex parte United States, \n226 \nU.S. 420\n, 33 S. Ct. 170. There was another appeal (\n236 \nU.S. 194\n, 35 S. Ct. 408) and, February 7, 1917, the District Court modified its decree in accordance with the direction of this court. The substance of the decree, as modified, so far as here material, is as follows:\n'(1) The Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis is an unlawful combination contrary to the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890 (26 Stat. 209), when it and the various bridge and terminal companies composing it are operated as railroad transportation companies. The combination may, however, exist and continue as a lawful unification of terminal facilities upon abandoning all operating methods and charges as and for railroad transportation and confining \n\n[266 U.S. 17, 24]\n\u00a0\n itself to the transaction of a terminal business such as supplying and operating facilities for the interchange of traffic between railroads and to assist in the collecting and distributing of traffic for the carrier companies, switching, storing and the like, and modifying its contracts as herein specified. An election having been made to continue the combination for terminal purposes, the defendants are therefore perpetually enjoined from in anywise managing or conducting the said Terminal Railroad Association or any of its constituent companies and from operating any of the properties belonging to it or its constituents otherwise than as terminal facilities for the railraod companies using the same, and from making charges otherwise than for and according to the nature of the services so lawfully authorized to be rendered: Provided, however, that the right of said Terminal Railroad Association as an accessory to its strictly terminal business to carry on transportation as to business exclusively originating on its lines, exclusively moving thereon, and exclusively intended for delivery on the same is hereby recognized and nothing in this decree shall be construed to deny such rights.'\n\n Paragraph 2 of the decree directs a reorganization of the contracts between the defendant railroad companies and the Terminal Association by providing for the admission of any railroad to joint ownership and control of the combined terminal properties on terms of equality with the then proprietary companies, and for the use of the terminal facilities by any railroad not a joint owner upon such terms as will, in respect of use, character and cost of service, place every such railroad upon as nearly an equal plane as may be, with respect to expenses and charges, as that occupied by proprietary companies, and by eliminating from the existing agreement any provision which restricts any proprietary company to the use of the facilities of the Terminal Association. \n\n[266 U.S. 17, 25]\n\u00a0\n Paragraph 3 abolishes the practice of billing to East St. Louis or other junction points, and then rebilling traffic destined to St. Louis or points beyond.\n Paragraph 4 abolishes any special or socalled arbitrary charge for the use of the terminal facilities in respect of traffic originating within the so-called 100-mile area that is not equally applied in respect of traffic originating outside of that area.\n Paragraph 5 extends the effect of the decree to all railroad companies thereafter admitted to ownership or use of the terminal facilities.\n Paragraph 6 is as follows:\n'Nothing in this decree shall be taken to affect in any wise or at an time the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission over the rates to be charged by the Terminal Railroad Association, or the mode of billing traffic passing over its lines, or the establishing of joint through rates or routes over its lines, or any other power conferred by law upon such commission.'\n\n The cause was reserved for such further orders and decrees as might be deemed necessary.\n Certain defendant railroad companies, for convenience, are called the west side lines. \n1\n Certain others are called the east side lines. \n2\n The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company and the Wabash Railway Company each has a line which enters St. Louis from the east and a line which enters it from the west, but they are aligned with the east side lines on this appeal. The capital stock \n\n[266 U.S. 17, 26]\n\u00a0\n of the Association is owned in equal amounts by all these companies, and they are called proprietary companies.\n In August, 1920, the west side lines filed a petition and motion in the District Courts to have the Terminal Association and its subsidiaries and the east side lines and also their representatives on the board of directors of the Terminal Association adjudged guilty of contempt of court for violating the decree. The parties so complained of (appellants here) appeared and moved to dismiss the petition and also filed answer. An examiner was appointed, and, after the taking of evidence and a hearing, the court denied the motion to dismiss, and entered its decree that the appellants--\n'have continuously since the entry of said final order and decree, in contempt of this court, violated the terms thereof and are still violating its said terms--\n\n'(a) In that defendants, the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and its subsidiary companies, are not acting in good faith as the impartial agents of the various proprietary lines.\n\n'(b) In that the proprietary lines other than the petitioners, through the domination and control of the board of directors of defendant the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and its subsidiaries compelled the petitioners to pay the Terminal Railroad Association its transfer charges for supplying and operating facilities for the interchange of both through east-bound and through west-bound freight traffic between the east side lines and the west side lines.\n\n'(c) In that the defendants [the east side lines above named] ... have not paid and are not now paying the reasonable transfer charges of defendant the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and its subsidiary companies on west-bound through freight to the rails' of the petitioners and other defendants whose lines enter St. Louis from the West. \n\n[266 U.S. 17, 27]\n\u00a0\n '(d) In that the said Terminal Railroad Association has been issuing bills of lading or receipts taking the place of bills of lading usable for the transportation of through freight from points on its lines to distant points beyond its lines, and has been issuing passes usable by passengers riding on passes or tickets from points on its lines to distant points beyond its lines.'\n\n And the decree commands that within 60 days the appellant companies cease violating the final decree in the respects above set forth, and that the east side lines--\n'be and they are hereby required to pay within 60 days after the amount of same shall have been ascertained and determined for the use and benefit of said west side lines ... the total amount of the transfer charges of defendant Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and its subsidiary companies paid by said west side lines on west-bound through freight of said east side lines to the rails of said west side lines at St. Louis, Mo., from the date of the entry of said final decree, to wit, March 2, 1914, to the date of this order . ...'\n\n And the decree prescribed and directed how such total amount should be determined.\n In these proceedings, the United States did not join in the complaint or participate in the hearing in the District Court, but has since appeared and is aligned with the appellees. The proceedings were instituted by the west side lines, not to vindicate the authority of the court, but to enforce rights claimed by them under the original decree. The controversy is between them and the east side lines as to whether the former or the latter shall bear transfer charges on west bound through freight. The nature of the proceedings is civil and remedial, not criminal. See In re Nevitt, 117 F. 448, 458, 54 C. C. A. 622; Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co., \n194 \nU.S. 324\n, 24 S. Ct. 665; Gompers v.

A. 582.\n This appeal was taken under the Expedition Act of February 11, 1903, c. 544, 32 Stat. 823. Appellants applied to the Circuit Judges for allowance of appeal and supersedeas. The appeal was allowed and supersedeas was granted on condition, among others, that, commencing 60 days after the entry of the decree, the east side lines pay to the Terminal Association and its subsidiaries charges for transferring west- bound through freight from the east side lines to the rails of the west side lines. Appellants, being unwilling to accept that burden, applied to a justice of this court, who allowed their appeal and, upon the giving of appropriate security, granted supersedeas without requiring such payments to be made pending the appeal. Appellees assert that the allowance of the appeal was under rule 36, which provides that an appeal from a District Court may be allowed and supersedeas granted by a justice of this court, in cases provided for in sections 238 and 252 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215, 1229); that thereby the case was brought under section 238, and that the question of jurisdiction is all that may be considered on this appeal. The contention is without merit. The authority of a justice of this court to allow appeals and grant supersedeas does not depend upon and is not limited by rule 36 or any other rule of this court. See Hudson v. Parker, \n156 \nU.S. 277, 284\n, 15 S. Ct. 450. The Expedition Act gives the right of appeal in this case, and the appeal was properly allowed by a justice of this court.

Ct. 559.\n The original decree was not enlarged by the decree appealed from. And, as there is no cross-appeal, no question is presented as to the right of the appellees to have it amended, so as to impose any additional condition on the continued existence of the combination as unified ter minal \n\n[266 U.S. 17, 29]\n\u00a0\n facilities. Peoria Ry. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 528, 536\n, 44 S. Ct. 194. The question whether the east side lines are bound to pay transfer charges on west-bound through freight depends upon the proper construction and application of the original decree.\n In contempt proceedings for its enforcement, a decree will not be expanded by implication or intendment beyond the meaning of its terms when read in the light of the issues and the purpose for which the suit was brought, and the facts found must constitute a plain violation of the decree so read.

Supp. 134.3 The statement of the decree appealed from [subdivision ( a)] that the Terminal Association and its subsidiaries are not acting in good faith as the impartial agents of the various proprietary lines is too general and vague, when considered by itself, to constitute a specification of facts amounting to contempt of court. The meaning and application of this general language is to be limited by the specification of details which follow it in (b) and (c) of the same section. Atkins v. Disintegrating Co., 18 Wall. 272, 302; Bock v. Perkins, \n139 \nU.S. 628, 634\n, 635 S., 11 S. Ct. 677; Brunson v. Carter Oil Co. (D. C.) 259 F. 656, 664.\n The original decree does not require the east side lines to pay the charges for transferring west-bound through freight. No provision so directs, and there is nothing in the circumstances to indicate that the court intended to prescribe the amount of such transfer charges or to fix liability therefor. United States v. St. Louis Terminal, \n\n[266 U.S. 17, 30]\n\u00a0\n \n236 \nU.S. 194, 204\n, 35 S. Ct. 408. The suit was brought by the United States to prevent restraint of trade and monopoly in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. It did not relate to the transfer charges or division of joint rates. All the proprietary companies were defendants. The pleadings presented no issue between the west side lines and the east side lines; and no controversy between them was determined by the decree.\n The practice of 'breaking' the rates on west-bound through freight at the east bank of the Mississippi river in East St. Louis has prevailed since 1877; that is, joint rates on freight moving from the east through St. Louis to points in the West have been considered as made up of an amount to cover the haul to the east bank of the river and an amount to cover the haul beyond that point. The former has been divided among the carriers hauling to the east bank of the river; the balance among those hauling from that point including the Terminal Association and its subsidiaries, making the transfer from the lines on the east to the lines on the west side of the river. It has also been the practice at this crossing to 'break' the joint rates on east-bound through freight at the same place. All rates have been set forth by tariffs, and the divisions of the charges among the participating carriers have been shown by their division sheets filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The practice has been the same on all competing routes crossing the river at points between East St. Louis and Dubuque.\n The making of rates is a legislative and not a judicial function Keller v. Potomac Electric Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428, 440\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 445; Ohio Valley Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287, 289\n, 40 S. Ct. 527; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v.

Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 \nU.S. 210, 226\n, 29 S. Ct. 67. The division of joint rates is also legislative in character. The Interstate \n\n[266 U.S. 17, 31]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Commission is authorized to establish through routes and joint rates and to prescribe conditions upon which such routes shall be operated, and to fix divisions of such rates among carriers. Section 15(1), (3), (6), Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Act Feb. 28, 1920,  418, c. 91, 41 Stat. 485, 486 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8583). It is well settled as a general rule that the question of the reasonableness of rates or of divisions of joint rates will not be considered by the courts before application has been made to the Commission. Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426, 440\n, 27 S. Ct. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075; Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R., \n222 \nU.S. 506\n, 32 S. Ct. 114; Mitchell Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania Coal Co., \n230 U.S. 247\n, 254-261, 33 S. Ct. 916; Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 39 S. Ct. 375; Kansas City, Mexico & Orient Divisions Case (U. S. v. Abilene & S. R. Co.), 44 S. Ct. 565. The Terminal Association and it subsidiaries are common carriers by railroad and, like the proprietary companies, are subject to regulation by the Commission. The original decree does not purport to regulate rates or prescribe divisions of joint rates, or fix liability for such transfer charges. On the other hand, it expressly provides that it shall not affect in any wise or at any time the power of the Commission over charges to be made by the Terminal Association or its subsidiaries, or any power conferred by law upon the Commission. In the exercise of its powers under existing law, the Commission is untrammeled by the decree and may make and regulate rates on through freight and the divisions thereof. As the original decree does not prescribe charges or fix divisions of joint rates, contempt proceedings will not lie to determine whether the west side lines have paid more than their fair share of the charges for the services rendered by the Terminal Association, or to require the east side lines to make the payments specified in the decree appealed from. The refusal or failure of the east side lines to pay the charges in controversy or any other transfer charges is not contempt of court. \n\n[266 U.S. 17, 32]\n\u00a0\n The issuing of the bills of lading, receipts and passes referred to in the decree [subdivision (d)] appealed from is not expressly forbidden by the original decree. But assuming in favor of the west side lines that such issuing is not included in the terminal business which the combination is permitted to do, it is not shown that any injury to them has resulted therefrom, or that they are entitled to any relief.

The demand was resisted on the ground that the tax was in contravention of the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States (article 1,  8, cl. 3), in that it was an interference with and tax upon interstate and foreign commerce. Defendant was regularly employed as agent for four steamship lines, under a contract fixing its compensation on the basis of commissions, calculated upon the gross amount of freight charges collected by it for each company. In addition, defendant occasionally represented other shipowners. All were exclusively engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, and defendant's business was confined solely to representing principals so engaged in such commerce. The service rendered consisted of soliciting and engaging cargo, nominating ships for carrying it, arranging for its delivery on the wharf, issuing bills of lading under the name of shipowner or charterer, arranging for stevedores for loading and discharging cargo, collecting freight charges, paying ships' disbursements, attending to immigration service, and assisting generally in matters of local customs and regulations. \n\n[264 U.S. 150, 152]\n\u00a0\n Freight moneys collected, after deducting commissions, were remitted to the owners or charterers. As such agent, defendant was authorized to solicit cargo and quote freight rates and to issue receipts in the name of its principal for cargo delivered on the wharf.\n Upon these facts the trial court held that defendant's business was local in character and subject to the tax. Upon appeal, this judgment was affirmed by the state Supreme Court. 152 La. 498, 93 South. 751.\n The state Supreme Court thus stated the necessity and character of the agent's duties:\n'The business of steamship agents is an extensive business in New Orleans, as it is in every large seaport. As a separate or an independent business, it is a result of the development of the country's commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. In the early days, when time was not so much the object or subject of economy as it is to-day, every ship's captain, for his own ship, discharged the duties and rendered the services for which local steamship agents are employed nowadays. But it would be impracticable now for a ship's captain to remain with his ship in port long enough to attend to the many matters which the local steamship agents can and do attend to for a ship at sea or in a foreign port. The business of steamship agents is therefore a necessary adjunct to commerce on the high seas.'\n\n This court has had frequent occasion to consider and determine the effect of taxes of the same general character as that here involved, and for present purposes we find it unnecessary to do more than refer to the general and well-established rule, which is that a state or state municipality is powerless to impose a tax upon persons for selling or seeking to sell the goods of a nonresident within the state prior to their introduction therein, Stockard v. Morgan, \n185 U.S. 27\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 576; or to impose a tax upon persons for securing or seeking to secure the trans portation \n\n[264 U.S. 150, 153]\n\u00a0\n of freight or passengers in interstate or foreign commerce, McCall v. California, \n136 U.S. 104\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 881. The latter decision controls the present case. There the agent of a railroad company was engaged in San Francisco in the business of soliciting and inducing persons to travel from the state of California into and through other states to New York City, over the line of railroad which he represented. It was held that the business of the agent constituted a method of securing passenger traffic for the company, and therefore (\n136 U.S. 109\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 882) the tax was one 'upon a means or an occupation of carrying on interstate commerce, pure and simple.' The only difference between that case and this is that there the agent was engaged in seeking interstate passenger business, while here the agent was engaged in seeking interstate and foreign freight business. Plainly, as pointed out in the McCall (\n136 U.S. 109\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 882), the principle is the same.\n Ficklen v. Shelby County, \n145 U.S. 1\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 810, is relied upon to justify the tax, but quite clearly it does not do so. The facts of that case differ materially from those of the McCall Case and those with which we are here dealing. In the Ficklen Case complainants were general merchandise brokers. They paid the initial tax imposed by the Tennessee law for the year 1887 and received and held throughout the year a general and unrestricted license to do business as such. They thereby became liable, under the statute, to pay an additional privilege tax in part graduated according to the amount of commissions received. It happened that during 1887 the principals of one complainant were wholly nonresident, and those of the other largely so. The opinion pointed out that the fact might have been otherwise then and afterward, since their business was not confined to transactions for nonresidents. At the expiration of the year complainants applied for a renewal of their licenses, which was refused because they had made no return of their commissions \n\n[264 U.S. 150, 154]\n\u00a0\n and no payment of the tax, as required. In deciding the case, stress was laid upon the fact that they had taken out a license under the law to do a general commission business, had given bond to report their commissions during the year and to pay the required percentage thereon, and, agreeing with the state court, it was said that resort to a judicial remedy could not be had because the authorities had refused to issue a license for the ensuing year without payment of the stipulated tax. Concluding the opinion, it was said:\n'What position they would have occupied if they had not undertaken to do a general commission business, and had taken out no licenses therefor, but had simply transacted business for nonresident principals, is an entirely different question, which does not arise upon this record.'\n\n The decision rests largely upon the elements above stated, as was pointed out by Mr. Justice Brewer in Brennan v. Titusville, \n153 \nU.S. 289, 307\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 829, 834 (38 L. Ed. 719):\n'It was held that the tax was an entirety, and was not effected by the variable and adventitious results of business from year to year . ... In other words, the tax imposed was for the privilege of doing a general commission business within the state, and whatever were the results pecuniarily to the licensees, or the manner in which they carried on business, the fact remained unchanged that the state had, for a stipulated price, granted them this privilege. It was thought by a majority of the court that to release them from the obligations of their bonds on account of the accidental results of the year's business was refining too much, and that the plaintiffs who had sought the privilege of engaging in a general business should be bound by the contracts which they had made with the state therefor.'\n\n The case is near the border line and has been deemed exceptional. Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 296\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 126; Stockard v. Morgan, supra, pages 34-37 (22 Stat. Ct. 576). \n\n[264 U.S. 150, 155]\n\u00a0\n The present case is sufficiently differentiated by the fact that the agent here neither did nor held itself out as ready to do a general business, partly local and partly interstate and foreign, but confined itself exclusively to the latter.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs.\n From the multitude of cases, this general rule may be educed. \n1\n The validity of a state tax under the commerce clause does not depend upon its character or classification. It is not void merely because it affects or burdens interstate commerce. The tax is void only if it directly burdens such commerce, or (where the burden is indirect) if the tax discriminates against or obstructs interstate commerce. In this case there is no claim that interstate commerce is discriminated against or obstructed. The contention is that the tax imposes a direct burden. Whether the burden should be deemed direct depends upon the character of plaintiff's occupation and its relation to interstate transactions.\n The occupation tax laid by New Orleans is fixed in amount; business being classified into several grades according to the amount of business done. The Texas Transport & Terminal Company falls within the highest grade-those whose receipts exceed $100,000 a year-and thus it is taxed $ 400 a year. The business is what is called a steamship agency. The main office is in New York City. It has branches in New Orleans and in five other ports of the United States. It is a wholly independent concern. No shipowner has an interest in it; and it has no interest in any ship which it serves. Some \n\n[264 U.S. 150, 156]\n\u00a0\n of these are regular ocean liners; others are casual tramp ships. The services rendered include, among other things, arranging with independent stevedore concerns for discharging and loading cargoes; arranging with independent dealers for bunkering, that is, buying fuel and oil; making provision for fitting ships for any special or peculiar cargo; making provision for compliance with the immigration and customs laws; and paying the ship's disbursements. For these, and the other services of soliciting cargoes, arranging for their delivery, and collecting payment for freight, the company is compensated. Usually the compensation is measured by a percentage on the gross freight charges collected. Sometimes it is a lump sum for each ship served. These comprehensive services require, for their efficient performance, the employment of a steamship agency, or its equivalent, whatever the home port of the ship or the principal place of its owner's business.\n It is settled law that interstate commerce is not directly burdened by a tax imposed upon property used exclusively in interstate commerce, Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, \n99 U.S. 273\n, 284; Dominion Steamship Co. v. Virginia, \n198 \nU.S. 299, 306\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 686, 3 Ann. Cas. 1100; or by a tax upon net income derived exclusively from interstate commerce, United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 U.S. 321\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E. 748; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 221 (compare Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 U.S. 165\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 432); or by an occupation tax, fixed in amount, although the business consists exclusively of selling goods brought from another state, Wagner v. City of Covington, \n251 U.S. 95\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 93. On the other hand, the burden is deemed direct, where the tax is upon property moving in interstate commerce, Champlain Realty Co. v. Brattelboro, \n260 U.S. 366\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 146, 25 A. L. R. 1195; or where it lays, like a gross receipts tax, a burden upon every transaction in such commerce 'by withholding for the use of the state part of every dollar received in such transactions,' \n\n[264 U.S. 150, 157]\n\u00a0\n Crew-Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 297\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 126; or where an occupation tax is laid upon one who, like a drummer or delivery agent, is engaged exclusively in inaugurating or completing his own or his employer's transaction in interstate commerce, Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n120 U.S. 489\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 592; Davis v. Virginia, \n236 U.S. 697\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 479.\n The New Orleans tax is obviously not laid upon property moving in interstate commerce. Nor does it, like a gross receipts tax, lay a burden upon every transaction. It is simply a tax upon one of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce. It is no more a direct burden than is the tax on the other indispensable instrumentalities; upon the ship; upon the pilot boat, which she must employ; upon the wharf at which she must load and unload; upon the office which the owner would have to hire for his employees, if, instead of engaging the services of an independent contractor, he had preferred to perform those duties himself. The fact that, in this case, the services are performed by an independent contractor having his own established business, and the fact that the services rendered are not limited to soliciting, differentiate this case from McCall v. California, \n136 U.S. 104\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 881. If these differences are deemed insufficient to distinguish that case from the one at bar, it should be frankly overruled, as inconsistent with the general trend of later decisions. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Thomas Reed Powell, 'Indirect Encroachment on Federal Authority by the Taxing Powers of the States,' 31 Harv.

Her master, appearing for the sole purpose of objecting to the court's jurisdiction, claimed immunity for the vessel because owned and possessed by the Turkish government, and asked that she be released. No one except the master has advanced this claim.\n The parties stipulated1: The Turkish government and the United States are at peace with each other, but diplomatic relations have been severed. The Gul Djemal is the absolute property of the Turkish government and under the administration of the transport section of the Ministry of Marine. That government employed and \n\n[264 U.S. 90, 92]\n\u00a0\n paid the master, officers and crew-the master being a reserve naval officer-and was in possession of the ship when arrested. She--\n'was engaged in commercial trade, under charter for one round voyage to George Dedeoglou, who engaged to carry passengers and goods for hire, and in such trade the Gul Djemal was not functioning in a naval or military capacity, nor was there anything of a naval or military character connected with the voyage of the Gul Djemal from Constantinople to New York and return.' return.'\n\n The court below denied the alleged immunity and passed a decree for the libelant. Upon this direct appeal only the question of jurisdiction is presented. The relevant certificate follows:\n'The sole question raised by the answer of the claimant herein, and the sole issue before this court, was the jurisdiction \n\n[264 U.S. 90, 93]\n\u00a0\n of the court over the steamship Gul Djemal, a vessel owned, manned, operated by, and in the possession of the sovereign government of Turkey, at peace with the government of the United States of America. The allegations of the libelant that it had furnished supplies to the vessel, were admitted by the claimant, whose answer set up that the vessel was immune, as a sovereign owned vessel, from the process of this court, and that the vessel was not within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of this court. I have granted a decree for the amount prayed for by the libelant, and have denied immunity to the vessel, because at the time the cause of action and \n\n[264 U.S. 90, 94]\n\u00a0\n liability on which the libel is founded were created, and at the time the vessel was seized under process of this court, she was, although owned, manned by, and in the possession of the sovereign government of Turkey, engaged in commercial trade, under charter for hire to a private trader, and furthermore, because diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey were then severed, and no appropriate suggestion was filed from the State Department of the United States.'\n\n Appellee maintains that whatever may be the proper rule in our courts concerning the ultimate immunity of vessels owned by foreign governments and employed in ordinary trade and commerce, such immunity will not be granted upon the mere claim of the master, especially when the United States has no diplomatic relations with the sovereign owner. Such claim can be made only by one duly authorized to vindicate the owner's sovereignty. Ex parte Muir, \n254 \nU.S. 522, 532\n, 533 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 185, 187 ( 65 L. Ed. 383), is relied upon to support this view. It is there said:\n'As of right the British government was entitled to appear in the suit, to propound its claim to the vessel and to raise the jurisdictional question. ... Or, with its sanction, its accredited and recognized representative might have appeared and have taken the same steps in its interest. ... And, if there was objection to appearing as a suitor in a foreign court, it was open to that government to make the asserted public status and immunity of the vessel the subject of diplomatic representations to the end that, if that claim was recognized by the Executive Department of this government, it might be set forth and supported in an appropriate suggestion to the court by the Attorney General, or some law officer acting under his direction.'\n\n Treating Ex parte Muir as relevant, appellant insists that within the meaning of the declaration there made the master of the Gul Djemal, a duly commissioned officer of \n\n[264 U.S. 90, 95]\n\u00a0\n the Turkish Navy, was the accredited and recognized representative of that government, possessed of adequate authority to protest against the seizure and object to the court's jurisdiction.\n We agree with the view advanced by the appellee. The Anne, 3 Wheat. 435, reaffirmed by The Sao Vicente, \n260 U.S. 151\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 15, is enough to show that the immunity could not have been successfully set up by a duly recognized consul, representative of his sovereign in commercial matters, in the ordinary course of his official duties, and there seems no adequate reason to presume that the master of the Gul Djemal had any greater authority in respect thereto. Although an officer of the Turkish Navy, he was performing no naval or military duty, and was serving upon a vessel not functioning in naval or military capacity, but engaged in commerce under charter to a private individual, who undertook to carry passengers and goods for hire. He was not shown to have any authority to represent his sovereign, other than can be inferred from his position as master and the circumstances specified in the stipulation of facts.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'First.

Fish, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Melville Church, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought by the Thomson Spot Welder Company in a Federal District Court in Michigan for the infringement of United States patent No. 1,046,066 for improvements in electric welding, issued December 3, 1912, to the plaintiff's predecessor in title, as assignee, upon an application filed by Johann Harmatta, December 3, 1903. The chief defenses were anticipation, lack of invention, prior public use, and estoppel. The District Court sustained all of these defenses, and dismissed the bill. 268 Fed. 836. The Circuit Court of Appeals-one judge dissenting-held the patent invalid for lack of invention, and, without considering the other defenses, affirmed the decree of the District Court. 281 Fed. 680. On account of a conflict with a prior decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Thomson Electric Welding Co. v. Barney & Berry, 227 Fed. 428, 142 C. C. A. 124, in which the patent had been held to be valid, this writ of certiorari was granted. \n260 U.S. 718\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 96.\n In the present case both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals have held that Harmatta's improvement involved merely the exercise of mechanical skill and not invention. The question whether an improvement requires mere mechanical skill or the exercise of the faculty of invention, is one of fact; and in an action at law for infringement is to be left to the determination of the jury.

Wright-Blodgett Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 397, 402\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 339; United States v. State Investment Co., \n264 U.S. 206\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 289, 68 L. Ed. --, and cases there cited. We think, however, that this rule should not be strictly applied in cases brought here because of a conflict of decision in the different circuit courts of appeal, and have therefore given consideration to the question as to which of the decisions upon this question of fact, in the light of the prior art, is based upon the sounder reasoning. At the outset it is to be noted that in the First Circuit there was not a concurrent finding on the question of patentability; the District Court having found, as did the two courts in the present case, that the patent was invalid for want of invention. 227 Fed. 428, 433.1\n Welding is the art, practiced immemorially, of uniting two pieces of metal in one piece by heating those portions which are to be welded to a temperature at which they become plastic and then pressing them strongly together so as to effect a union, as exemplified by a blacksmith when heating in a forge the two pieces to be welded and hammering them together.\n The art of electric welding, which was invented in 1886, was well advanced when Harmatta filed his application, having been disclosed in various prior patents for uniting the abutting ends of metal bars, wires, etc., uniting the over-lapped edges of metal sheets, plates, etc., and other purposes. \n\n[265 U.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n The patent in suit relates to that branch of electric welding known as spot welding, by which two sheets or plates are welded together face to face, in spots, as a substitute for riveting; this being accomplished by placing the two sheets between two pointed electrodes applied to their exterior surfaces, opposite to one another, which heat the sheets to the welding temperature and exert the required pressure in the line between the points of the electrodes, resulting in welding together the inside faces of the sheets in the spot on that line.\n The reasons for which the petitioner claims that this improvement is patentable are thus summarized in its brief:\n'Harmatta produced a new result, namely a small round weld (a spot weld) uniting two plane sheets of metal at any place in their meeting faces. This was radically new. ... (2) To make this spot weld Harmatta manipulated the articles with which he dealt, namely the sheets, in a new way by indiscriminately superimposing one upon the other and he made his electrodes perform a function, which no electrodes, used in electric welding, had ever before performed. (3) In so doing he carried out a new technical process, that is, the electric current, which generates the welding heat, behaved and operated in an entirely new way, ... and he applied the welding pressure to a condition, which seemed to make such application impossible.'\n\n The opinions of the two District Courts and of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that the patent in suit was lacking in invention, are based, in each instance, on a detailed and analytical consideration of the prior art. We take the following extracts from the well considered opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals:\n'The art of electric resistance welding was old and far advanced in 1903, when the Harmatta patent was applied for. Prof. Elihu Thomson ... was a pioneer in \n\n[265 U.S. 445, 449]\n\u00a0\n that art. In 1886 he obtained process and apparatus patents ... for so-called butt welding, which involved the uniting of the abutting ends of metal wires, bars, etc., by applying heat at the joint and the adjacent surfaces by means of electrodes, and pressing the two pieces together when heated to welding temperature. There was here true resistance welding, with pressure of the parts involved, although the electrode did not exert the welding pressure. In 1889 Thomson obtained a patent ... for electric riveting, which involved the heating of the rivet when in place by means of a current passed through it by the use of electrodes, under pressure thereon, the effect being not only to swage the rivet and weld it to the adjoining metal, but apparently (when desired) to weld together, in part at least, the portions of the plates immediately adjoining the rivet. In 1891 Thomson obtained a patent ... for what is called lap-welding. While the specification states that the invention is specially adapted to the welding of the overlapped edges of plates, it ... expressly includes 'welding together strips, sheets, plates, or bars of metal where it is desirable to form a joint of considerable length.' According to the specification, 'the surfaces to be welded are pressed together to form a union,' the work being fed in the longitudinal direction of the joint 'through suitable pressure devices (preferably roller electrodes), the work being properly arranged, so that the pressure devices will press the surfaces to be welded together and simultaneously passing the electric current through the work at the point of pressure, The electrodes were employed to exert the welding pressure. The specification further states that 'as the work is passed through such rolls with a continuous motion each point, as it comes between the rolls, is heated and the surfaces pressed together.' ... In 1893 Thomson obtained a patent ... relating particularly to soldering sheet metal pieces flatwiser, either \n\n[265 U.S. 445, 450]\n\u00a0\n by the use of solder or (when applied to tin plates) by melting the tin sufficiently to establish union thereby. The electrodes, in the form of clamps or otherwise, served not only to supply the necessary heat, but to exert sufficient pressure upon the overlapped sheets to effect their union. A roller electrode is disclosed, performing the double function of heating and pressing, and having its periphery corrugated or grooved ... This was, to say the least, electric resistance spot soldering. In 1897 Robinson received a patent ... on so-called projection welding, as specially applied to the welding of a splice bar to the web of a railroad rail, the splice bar having upon its inner face a number of projections which by the application of the heating current are fused, and by pressure made to form welds between the projections on the bar and the fused opposing portions of the rail. Kleinschmidt, in 1898, took out a patent ... for a similar process, and by methods not essentially unlike those of Robinson.\n\n'Whether or not the Thomson so-called lapwelding invention should be regarded as an absolute anticipation of the Harmatta patent, we think the state of the art to which we have referred left no room for invention in Harmatta. ... We see no distinction upon principle between plane-face welding and lap-welding; the former certainly embraces the latter. If Thomson's roller electrode device was capable of welding a line or seam in a metal lap joint, it was readily adaptable to line-welding together coterminous plane-face plates . ... We think Thomson's lap-welding invention was in essence a welding in points. In fact, his line seam was merely a succession of adjoining points. ... It satisfactorily appears that, although Thomson's roller electrodes in the form shown in the patent were not practicably adapted to commercial spot-welding as disclosed by the Harmatta patent, they could readily be made to do such spot-welding \n\n[265 U.S. 445, 451]\n\u00a0\n by the use of the suitable projections upon the face of the rolls ( Thomson later did spot-soldering by the use of such projections); and assuming that pin electrodes were essential to successful commercial spot-welding, that form of electrodes was old, as illustrated by Thomson's electric soldering patent. ... In our opinion the art of soldering is analogous to that of welding. ... By the use of enough more heat Thomson's soldering device could readily have effected spot- welding. ... No essential difference in principle between heating at points and heating in spots is apparent. Projection welding partakes, though not in so pronounced a sense, of the nature of spot- welding. We agree with Judge Dodge [227 Fed. 428] that Harmatta's idea of 'making his electric welds small in area rather than large in comparison with the areas of the opposed surface to be joined and isolating them, so as to leave each surrounded by a comparatively large area of unwelded surface,' does not involve invention in view of the prior art. In other words, given the desire for a welding in spots, naturally enough suggested by the prior art and by its commercial development, we think Harmatta's specific application of the principles of that prior art involved only the skill of the expert mechanic. Not only every principle, but every electric and mechanical process, involved in the Harmatta claims, was well known in the prior or directly analogous arts, or in mechanical arts generally. We cannot think, in view of the prior art, that invention is to be found in the considerations, separately or collectively, that in Harmatta no bodily movement of the sheets is required, that the current is localized and pressure exerted solely by the electrodes, or by the difference in the form of the electrodes, or by the difference in amount of extruded metal, as compared with some of the earlier applications of resistance welding. Although invention is not necessarily negatived by the fact that each element of the \n\n[265 U.S. 445, 452]\n\u00a0\n combination is old, the question of fact whether the combination itself involves invention in view of the prior art is always present.\n\n'Our conclusion of noninvention, based upon a review of the prior art, is materially strengthened by the serious doubt whether Harmatta thought, when he filed his patent application, that he had patentably invented anything by the disclosure of spot-welding as a process or product distinct from point-welding or linewelding, as well as by the fact that others previous to the grant to Harmatta, and apparently in ignorance of Harmatta's claimed invention, successfully practiced the art of spot-welding. ...\n\n'The patent issued nine years after the application was filed, and after numerous vicissitudes and amendments (including the entire elimination of the roller-electrode feature), and after the application had been placed in interference with the claims of Adolph Rietzel, to whom a patent had previously been issued on July 20, 1909 . ... From the beginning Rietzel's application was owned by plaintiff's predecessor. The interference was declared in favor of Harmatta, for Rietzel's failure, as the junior party to the interference, to take testimony in support of his claim of priority; plaintiff's predecessor, at the time owning both the Harmatta application and the Rietzel patent. \n2\n ... But the fact that the award of priority was not based upon an adjudication on the merits tends to weaken its force. It, however, convincingly appears ... that in 1898 (and about five years before Harmatta's application) Rietzel, while in the employ of plaintiff's predecessor, in several instances successfully joined two pieces of lapped metal at isolated spots by means of a Thomson buttwelding machine; the \n\n[265 U.S. 445, 453]\n\u00a0\n sheets of metal being united by pressing them together and at the same time passing the heating current from one electrode (or so- called contact) to the opposite electrode, at the selected spot on the meeting surface of the plates, the spots being restricted in area, so as to leave well-defined and comparatively extensive areas of no- union completely surrounding the spots-one of the electrodes or contacts used being of standard size and form, the other being reduced by cutting down to a diameter of about three-eighths of an inch. ... Rietzel's experience strongly discredits inventive quality in what Harmatta did several years later, including his disclosure of the use of pin-electrodes. The fact also appears ... that at various times, ranging from two years to five or six years, before the issue of the Harmatta patent, and apparently in ignorance of his asserted invention, various manufacturers put out or used spot- welding machines with commercial success. ... These experiences also tend to discredit invention in Harmatta.\n\n'It follows, in our opinion, from what has been said, that the effect of the great commercial success of the Harmatta invention in the hands of plaintiff is entitled to little weight upon the question of invention, even were that question otherwise in doubt, which we think it is not.'\n\n 281 Fed. 682 et seq.\n The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, on the other hand, contains only general allusions to the prior art and no analysis of the prior patents. While, in considering the defense of anticipation, it is said that the soldering art was remote, the only statement in the opinion bearing directly upon the defense of want of invention, is that:\n'In view of the further proposition that the presumptions in favor of the patent are so far supported in this case by the insistency of the defense, and the comparatively enormous expense involved in maintaining it, we cannot question the present \n\n[265 U.S. 445, 454]\n\u00a0\n validity of the patent with reference to all propositions involved in the word 'patentability.\" 227 Fed. 436, 142 C. C. A. 132.\n\n The conclusion of fact reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, as set forth in its opinion, that in the light of the prior art Harmatta's improvement was lacking in invention, commends itself to our judgment. It involves no error in law. Therefore, without considering the other defenses presented, the decree of that court is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The opinion of the District Court is published with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The proceedings in the Patent Office are set forth at length in the opinion of the District Court (pages 855 et seq.). \n\n\n\n\n","174":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTIDAL OIL CO. v. FLANAGAN(1924)\nNo. 179\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 444, 445]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Preston C. West, A. A. Davidson, Wallace C. Franklin, and Arthur J. Biddison, all of Tulsa, Okl., for plaintiffs in error, in opposition to the motion.\n Messrs. Edward H. Chandler and Wm. O. Beall, both of Tulsa, Okl., for defendant in error, in support of the motion.\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 444, 448]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n J. P. Flanagan sued the Tidal Oil Company and Eleanor Arnold in the district court of Creek county, Oklahoma, to quiet his title to two tracts of land therein of 80 acres each. His title was based on a quitclaim deed of Robert Marshall, an allottee and citizen of the Creek Nation, executed in October, 1916, after Marshall had attained his majority and had been discharged from guardianship. The defendants derived their title from the same allottee, but the deed under which they claimed was made by Marshall when he was 14 years old and married, and after he had been granted majority rights by the district court. He subsequently sought to have this deed canceled in a suit in the same court brought by his guardian, but judgment went against him. Defendants insisted that this judgment was conclusive in the case at bar against the plaintiff as subsequent \n\n[263 U.S. 444, 449]\n\u00a0\n grantee of Marshall. After this judgment, and by way of compromise, gas and oil leases and contracts to convey were made in favor of defendants or their grantors by the guardian and approved by the county court, and these were also relied on to defeat plaintiff's title. The district court gave judgment in favor of Flanagan for the lands and included a heavy recovery for mesne profits. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma affirmed this, but somewhat reduced the amount of recovery. It held that the deed and agreements and leases under which defendants claimed were void because Marshall was a minor when they were made; that the judgment of the district court against him and his guardian in their suit to cancel the first deed was void because it appeared on the face of the record that Marshall was then a minor and that these were allotted lands, of the title to which he could not be divested except in a probate court under procedure required by a state statute and not complied with. The errors here assigned are, first, that the judgment deprived the defendants of their property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment; and, second, that the Supreme Court of the state in holding the judgment and confirmations of the district and county courts to be void, reversed its previous decisions and changed a rule of property of the state upon the faith of which the deed, leases and other contracts set up by defendants were made, and thus impaired their obligation in violation of section 10, article 1, of the federal Constitution.\n A motion to dismiss is made by the defendant in error, because the federal questions were too late, in that they were raised for the first time in petitions for rehearing which the court denied without opinion. The record does not sustain this ground in respect to the objection based on the Fourteenth Amendment, because that appears in the assignment of errors filed on the appeal from \n\n[263 U.S. 444, 450]\n\u00a0\n the district court to the state Supreme Court. The assignment, however, has no substance in it. The parties to this action have been fully heard in the state court in the regular course of judicial proceedings and in such a case the mere fact that the state court reversed a former decision to the prejudice of one party does not take away his property without due process of law. This was expressly held in the case of Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 \nU.S. 103, 112\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 80. See, also, Morley v. Lake Shore Railway Co., \n146 \nU.S. 162, 171\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 54; Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 461\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 556, 10 Ann. Cas. 689; Delmar Jockey Club v. Missouri, \n210 \nU.S. 324, 335\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 732; Bonner v. Gorman, \n213 \nU.S. 86, 91\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 483; Milwaukee Electric Ry. Co. v. Milwaukee, \n252 \nU.S. 100, 106\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 306, 10 A. L. R. 892.\n A ground for dismissal urged is that the validity of no federal or state statute or authority exercised under the United States or the state, was drawn in question in the state court on the ground of a repugnance to the federal Constitution and hence there is no right to a writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended by the Act of September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. 726 [Comp St.  1214]), and that the only remedy available to the plaintiffs in error was an application to this court for certiorari because they had been denied a right, title, privilege or immunity granted by the federal Constitution. In answer the plaintiffs in error invite attention to an Act of Congress of February 17, 1922 (42 Stat. 366), again amending section 237, reading as follows:\n'In any suit involving the validity of a contract wherein it is claimed that a change in the rule of law or construction of statutes by the highest court of a state applicable to such contract would be repugnent to the Constitution of the United States, the Supreme Court shall, upon writ of error, re-examine, reverse, or affirm the final judgment of the highest court of a state in which a decision in the suit could be had, if said claim is made in said \n\n[263 U.S. 444, 451]\n\u00a0\n court at any time before said final judgment is entered and if the decision is against the claim so made.' Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1214\n\n\n\n The case before us seems clearly within the foregoing. It does involve the validity of a contract, it is claimed that a change in the rule of law by the highest court of the state applicable to the contract is repugnant to the federal Constitution, and the decision of that court was against the claim.\n It has been settled by a long line of decisions,1 that the provision of section 10, article 1, of the federal Constitution, protecting the obligation of contracts against state action, is directed only against impairment by legislation and not by judgments of courts. The language-'No state shall ... pass any ... law impairing the obligation of contracts'-plainly requires such a conclusion. However, the fact that it has been necessary for this court to decide the question so many times is evidence of persistent error in regard to it. Among the cases relied on to sustain the error, are Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175; Butz v. Muscatine, 8 Wall. 575; Douglass v. Pike County, \n101 U.S. 677\n; Anderson v. Santa Anna Twp., \n116 U.S. 356\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 413; German Savings Bank v. Franklin County, \n128 U.S. 526\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 159; Rowan v. Runnels, 5 How. 134, 139; and Los Angeles v. \n\n[263 U.S. 444, 452]\n\u00a0\n Los Angeles City Water Co., \n177 U.S. 558\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 736. These cases were not writs of error to the Supreme Court of a state. They were appeals or writs of error to federal courts where recovery was sought upon municipal or county bonds or some other form of contracts, the validity of which had been sustained by decisions of the Supreme Court of a state prior to their execution, and had been denied by the same court after their issue or making. In such cases the federal courts exercising jurisdiction between citizens of different states held themselves free to decide what the state law was, and to enforce it as laid down by the state Supreme Court before the contracts were made rather than in later decisions. They did not base this conclusion on article 1, section 10, of the Federal Constitution, but on the state law as they determined it, which, in diverse citizenship cases, under the third article of the federal Constitution they were empowered to do. Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 U.S. 20\n, 2 Sup. Ct. 10. In such cases, as a general rule, they, in the interest of comity and uniformity, followed the decisions of state courts as to the state law, but, where gross injustice would be otherwise done, they followed the earlier rather than the later decisions as to what it was. Had such cases been decided by the state courts however, and had it been attempted to bring them here by writ of error to the state Supreme Court, they would have presented no federal question, and this court must have dismissed the writs for lack both of power and jurisdiction. This is well illustrated by the case of Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, and Railroad Co. v. McClure, 10 Wall. 511. In the former, bonds sued on in the Circuit Court of the United States, were collected under judgment of this court. In the latter, like bonds sued on in a state court were held invalid, and a writ of error to the state Supreme Court was dismissed.\n Other cases cited are Louisiana v. Pilsbury, \n105 U.S. 278\n, and Muhlker v. New York & Harlem R. R. Co., 197 \n\n[263 U.S. 444, 453]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 544, 25 Sup. Ct. 522, but in each of them a statute had been passed subsequently to the contract involved and was held to impair it. In such a case this court accepts the meaning put upon the impairing statute by the state court as authoritative, but it is the statute as enforced by the state through its courts which impairs the contract, not the judgment of the court.\n There is another class of cases relied on to maintain this writ of error. They are those in which this court has held that in determining whether a state law has impaired a contract, it must decide for itself whether there was a contract and whether the law as enforced by the state court impairs it. It often happens that a law of the state constitutes part of the contract and to make the constitutional inhibition effective, this court must exercise an independent judgment in deciding as to the validity and construction of the law and the existence and terms of the contract. Jefferson Branch Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black, 436, 443; Bridge Proprietors v. Hoboken Co., 1 Wall. 116, 145; Wright v. Nagle, \n101 U.S. 791\n, 793; and McGahey v. Virginia, \n135 \nU.S. 662, 667\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 972.\n Then there are cases like McCullough v. Virginia, \n172 U.S. 102\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 134, Houston & Texas Central Railroad v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 66, 76\n, 77 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 545, Hubert v. New Orleans, \n215 \nU.S. 170, 175\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 40, Carondelet Canal Co. v. Louisiana, \n233 \nU.S. 362, 376\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 627, and Louisiana Railway & Nav. Co. v. New Orleans, \n235 \nU.S. 164, 171\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 62. In each of them the judgment of the state Supreme Court seemed from its opinion merely to be a reversal of a previous construction by it of a statute upon the faith of which the contract had been made. In fact, however, the judgment merely gave effect to an existing subsequent statute impairing the obligation of the contract which was thus a law passed in violation of article 1, section 10.\n The difference between all these classes of cases and the present one wherein it is claimed that a state court judgment \n\n[263 U.S. 444, 454]\n\u00a0\n alone, and without any law, impairs the obligation of a contract, has been carefully pointed out in Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 \nU.S. 103, 111\n, 120 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 80, in Bacon v. Texas, \n163 \nU.S. 207, 221\n, 223 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 1023, and in Ross v. Oregon, \n227 \nU.S. 150, 161\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 220, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 224. Certain unguarded language in Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, 206; Butz v. City of Muscatine, 8 Wall. 575, 583, and in Douglass v. Pike County, \n101 U.S. 677\n, 686-687, and in some other cases has caused confusion, although those cases did not really involve the contract impairment clause of the Constitution.\n We come, then, to the last point made on behalf of plaintiffs in error. It may be best stated in the words of their brief. After referring to Gelpcke v. Dubugue, supra, Douglass v. Pike County, supra, Anderson v. Township, supra, and German Savings Bank v. Franklin County, supra, counsel say:\n'The court has held, however, under the Codes prior to the amendment of February 17, 1922, that it had no appellate jurisdiction to review this character of question on a writ of error to a state court. This, as we understand it, is the rule announced in the cases cited by defendant in error, such as Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 U.S. 103\n, Bacon v. State, \n163 U.S. 207\n, and Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., \n261 U.S. 114\n.\n\n'Evidently the amendment of February 17, 1922, to section 237 of the Judicial Code, was for the express purpose of extending the appellate jurisdiction of this court to cover cases involving the impairment of contract obligations by change of judicial decision in the construction of applicable statutes. This is the plain language of the act.'\n\n The intention of Congress was not, we think, to add to the general appellate jurisdiction of this court existing under prior legislation, but rather to permit a review on writ of error in a particular class of cases in which the defeated party claims that his federal constitutional rights \n\n[263 U.S. 444, 455]\n\u00a0\n have been violated by the judgment of the state court itself, and further to permit the raising of the objection after the handing down of the opinion. This court has always held it a prerequisite to the consideration here of a federal question in a case coming from a state court that the question should have been raised in that court before decision, or that it should have been actually entertained and considered upon petition to rehear. A mere denial of the petition by the state court without opinion, is not enough. Godchaux Co. v. Estopinal, \n251 \nU.S. 179, 181\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 116; Bilby v. Stewart, \n246 U.S. 255\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 264; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Taber, \n244 U.S. 200\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 522; St. Louis & San Francisco R. R. Co. v. Shepherd, \n240 \nU.S. 240, 241\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 274; Consolidated Turnpike Co. v. Norfolk, etc., Railway, \n228 \nU.S. 326, 334\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 510; Forbes v. State Council of Virginia, \n216 \nU.S. 396, 399\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 295; McCorquodale v. Texas, \n211 \nU.S. 432, 437\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 146; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. McGrew, \n188 \nU.S. 291, 308\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 375, 63 L. R. A 33; Mallett v. North Carolina, \n181 \nU.S. 589, 592\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 730; Pim v. St. Louis, \n165 U.S. 273\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 322.\n It was the purpose of the Act of 1922 to change the rule established by this formidable array of authorities as to the class of cases therein described. The question in such cases could not well be raised until the handing down of the opinion indicating that the objectionable judgment was to follow. This act was intended to secure to the defeated party the right to raise the question here if the state court denied the petition for rehearing without opinion.\n We cannot assume that Congress attempted to give to this court appellate jurisdiction beyond the judicial power accorded to the United States by the Constitution. The mere reversal by a state court of its previous decision, as in this case before us, whatever its effect upon contracts, does not, as we have seen, violate any clause of the federal Constitution. Plaintiff's claim, therefore, does not raise a substantial federal question. This has been \n\n[263 U.S. 444, 456]\n\u00a0\n decided in so many cases that it becomes our duty to dismiss the writ of error for want of jurisdiction. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Commercial Bank v.

WALDMAN(1924)\nNo. 95\nArgued: Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 113, 114]\n\u00a0\n This is a certiorari to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, discharging Mrs. Szejwa Waldman and her three minor children as relators in a writ of habeas corpus. The writ was issued by the District Court for the Southern District of New York, to Robert E. Tod, Commissioner of Immigration at Ellis Island. That court dismissed the petition and remanded the relators. Mrs. Waldman and her children, reaching New York from Europe, were, after examination, detained at Ellis Island on August 28, 1922, for deportation, on the ground that they were liable to become public charges if admitted to the United States, and also because the mother was an illiterate person. She appealed to the Department of Labor, which directed the case to be reopened before a Board of Special Inquiry for the purpose of according her a re-examination regarding her ability to read Yiddish and Hebrew, with direction, if she did not pass it, to deport her and her family, without further reference to the department. She was re-examined. She alleged in her petition that although she was able to read in Yiddish, she was declared illiterate and she and her family were ordered deported on the next sailing and was refused appeal from this decision. She further alleged that she and her family were seeking admission to the United States to avoid religious persecution in their home in Proskurow (once in Russia and now in the Ukraine), that she escaped from there in 1919, and after 17 months spent in securing a passport to this country came here as a refugee; that, if she is de- \n\n[266 U.S. 113, 115]\n\u00a0\n ported from the United States, she must be returned to Proskurow, and that she and her children would be in danger of death; that she and they, as refugees from religious persecution, are exempt by the immigration statute from the operation of the literacy test, but that this claim as such refugees had not been considered by the Commissioner of Immigration or the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the rules of the Immigration Bureau, although the facts were fully shown in her sworn evidence before the Commissioner. Her petition further alleged that relatives of hers, who are responsible citizens and residents of the United States, are willing to furnish a satisfactory bond that the Waldman family will not become public charges; indeed, that they are themselves willing and able to agree to support the family.\n The return asked that the writ be quashed because it did not appear that there was no evidence before the department upon which the warrant could be based, or that the issues sought by the petition now to be litigated in the court had not already been determined by the Department of Labor adversely to the aliens. The return exhibits the records of the department and the evidence taken, and a medical certificate showing that one of the daughters, Zenia Waldman, is afflicted with a dislocation of the left hip, causing shortening of the left leg and lameness, which may affect her ability to earn a living, and that for this, and for failure of the mother to pass the language test, all the aliens were properly ordered excluded; that on appeal, after a careful consideration, the Second Assistant Secretary directed that the case be reopened before a Board of Special Inquiry; that another hearing was given by a different Board of Special Inquiry and the minutes of the prior hearing being made a part of the evidence taken and other evidence introduced, a copy of which is annexed. And that the board duly and \n\n[266 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n unanimously reaffirmed the former order of exclusion. The return concludes:\n'The proofs and record of the proceeding before mentioned having been duly transmitted to him, the Secretary of Labor, after carefully considering the evidence presented in the record, duly affirmed the excluding decision of the board and directed the deportation of the aliens herein; and for the cause of the detention of the said aliens complained of in the petition herein, deponent says that the said aliens are and since the receipt of said writ of habeas corpus have been held under and in obedience to said writ.'\n\n The prayer was that the writ of habeas corpus be dismissed and the aliens remanded to the custody of the commissioner, to be dealt with in accordance with the order of exclusion.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the failure of the return to set out the details of the test as to the knowledge of Mrs. Waldman in Yiddish and Hebrew, at the first and second hearing, was improper; that the test directed in both Hebrew and Yiddish, which the statute recognized as different languages, was a double one, for which there was no warrant in he statute. Without stressing these defects, the court, pointing out that by section 17 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917 (chapter 29, 39 Stat. 874, 887 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 ii]), and regulations duly issued thereunder, when a case is referred back to a board by the bureau or department, in order that additional evidence may be taken, and a new decision is rendered by the board, the reopened hearing is to be 'of the same nature and subject to the same conditions, limitations and privileges as an original hearing,' held that the departmental order reopening the case was illegal in that it took away the right of appeal after the second examination, and that the warrant of deportation was void. The Circuit Court of Appeals further held that the record so left the case \n\n[266 U.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n of the child Zenia that it must be assumed that the decision to exclude her was not affirmed by the Department of Labor, and that the department may well have disagreed with the local board as to whether or not the physical defect would interfere with the ability of Zenia to earn a living. The order of the District Court was reversed, with directions to enter an order discharging the relators and releasing their bail.\n An application for a rehearing was made to the Circuit Court of Appeals to modify its order, so as not to discharge the relators and their bail, but to direct that the trial court might itself proceed to hear the issues and determine the admissibility of the appellants. The Circuit Court of Appeals declined to make this modification, but said that as the judgment was not res adjudicata, the executive authorities might rearrest the relator and institute further proceedings to test the legality of her being in the country. It is the discharge of the relators and their bail by the Circuit Court of Appeals of which the government complains.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for petitioner.\n Mr. Max J. Kohler, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[266 U.S. 113, 118]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We think that the complaint of the government is well founded. The petitioners in the writ of habeas corpus were aliens who had not been legally admitted to the country-that is, neither the immigration authorities anor the court had held that they were entitled to admission. The immigration authorities had ordered their deportation. The Circuit Court of Appeals merely found that in the course of the examination by the immigration authorities the relators had not been given a fair opportunity to appeal to the Secretary of Labor as provided by the statute. This denial of appeal did not give to them a right to admission to the country. In the due and orderly disposition of the writ of habeas corpus, relators should not have been discharged and their bail released, but the order should have been framed so as to secure the benefit of the appeal to the relators, to which the court by its decision had held them entitled. To discharge them was to take them out of the proper custody of the government authorities pending their admission or exclusion, was to entail upon the government the affirmative and initial duty of rearresting them and was improperly discharging the security for their response to any lawful order of the immigration authorities. The mere fact that by rearrest the government would not be confronted by any judgment of res adjudicata did not suffice. The power of the court in such a case is indicated by section 761 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1289) in reference to habeas corpus. The section provides that a court or justice or judge shall proceed in a summary manner to determine the facts of the case by hearing the testimony and arguments and thereupon to dispose of the party as law and justice require. The law and justice here required under the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was that the \n\n[266 U.S. 113, 119]\n\u00a0\n case should be sent to the District Court with instructions to remand the petitioners to the custody of the immigration authorities, to await the result of the appeal from the judgment of deportation to the Secretary of Labor.\n Counsel for the government urge that under three decisions of this court, Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 8, 13\n, 28 S. Ct. 201; Kwock Jan Fat v. White, \n253 \nU.S. 454\n, 40 S. Ct. 566, and Ng Fung Ho v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276\n, 42 S. Ct. 492, the question with respect to which the petitioners have not been given a fair hearing should now be remanded to the District Court for its decision. Without saying that the circumstances might not arise which would justify such a variation in the order from that which we now direct, we do not think that the course taken in the cases cited should guide us here. In those cases the single question was whether the petitioner was a citizen of the United States before he sought admission, a question of frequent judicial inquiry. Here the questions are technical ones involving the educational qualification of an immigrant in a language foreign to ours, and the medical inquiry as to effect of a physical defect on the probability of a child's being able to earn a living or of becoming a public charge. The court is not as well qualified in such cases to consider and decide the issues as the immigration authorities. The statute intends that such questions shall be considered and determined by the immigration authorities. It would seem better to remand the relators to the hearing of the appeal, by the Secretary and this assistants, who have constant practice and are better advised in deciding such questions.\n We concur with the Circuit Court of Appeals in its criticism of the record in this case in that it does not set out more fully the details of the test applied in the examinations. The record is defective also in not showing the definite rulings of the commissioner or the Board of Inquiry on the issues made by Mrs. Waldman in her \n\n[266 U.S. 113, 120]\n\u00a0\n evidence. This made clear her claim that she and her children were refugees from religious persecution relieving her from an educational test; but no finding appears in the record on this point either by the board or the department on appeal. The mere implication that the claim must have been passed on adversely to her because the language test was applied is not enough. If the necessary finding was in fact made, it should be made part of the record. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals also that the absence from the record of any finding by the department on appeal as to the issue whether the lameness of Zenia, one of the children, affected her ability to earn a living or made her likely to become a public charge is a defect. The inquiry and finding should have been made. If made, the record should disclose it. If not made, the inquiry should be made and the finding recorded.\n We see no reason, therefore, why upon the appeal which it is now decided the Secretary of Labor must afford the relators, he should not consider and make a definite finding on the issues made by the petition, to wit, first whether the relators are not relieved from the test as to language because they are refugees from religious persecution; second whether, if it be necessary, a proper test as to the reading knowledge of Yiddish only, which Mrs. Waldman had, was sufficient to meet the requirements of the statute, and if not to order another; and, third, whether the lameness of Zenia Waldman is likely to affect her ability to earn her living or to make her a public charge. The order of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and modified in accordance with this opinion, with instructions to remand the petitioners to the custody of the immigration authorities to await the hearing on the appeal before the Secretary of Labor. Failing the granting and hearing of the appeal within 30 days after the coming down of the mandate herein, the relators \n\n[266 U.S. 113, 121]\n\u00a0\n and their bail are to be discharged.

St.  1215).\n This court is without jurisdiction of the writ of error. It was settled in Oliver American Trading Co. v. United States of Mexico, \n264 U.S. 440\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 390, 68 L. Ed. -- (decided since the entry of the judgment below), that the claim of sovereign immunity does not present a question of federal jurisdiction within the meaning of section 238. This is equally true whether the claim of immunity is contested because of the character of the defendant or because the immunity is alleged to have been waived.

The plaintiff prevailed in the Philippine courts, both trial and appellate (Sagrada Orden de Predicadores, etc., v. Trinidad, 42 Phil. Rep. 397), and the case is here on certiorari (\n260 U.S. 711\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 13).\n The tax was levied under paragraphs G(a) and M of section 2 of the Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 172, 180, requiring every corporation, not within defined exceptions, to pay an annual tax, computed at a specified rate, on its entire net income from all sources. The exceptions covered, among others, any corporation 'organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific or educational purposes, no part of the net income of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.' The plaintiff insisted it was within this exception, and the Philippine courts so ruled.\n The case was heard on a stipulation stating:\n'That the plaintiff is a corporation sole constituted under sections 154 to 164 of Act No. 1459 of the Philippine Commission, and is organized and operated for religious, benevolent, scientific and educational purposes in these islands and in its missions in China, Cochin China and Japan, and that neither its net income nor part of its rents from whatever source it may come is applied to the benefit of any particular stockholder or individual, or of any of its members, and that no part of the whole or of some of its temporal properties belong to any of its members, who have no rights to the same, even in case of dissolution of the corporation.\n\n'That the dividends and interests or profits and expenses, which appear in Exhibit 1 of the defendant as the income of the plaintiff, constitute the income derived from the investments of the capital of the plaintiff corporation, which was invested, in the year 1913, nearly in the manner \n\n[263 U.S. 578, 580]\n\u00a0\n and form specified in Exhibit 2 of the defendant, and that the rents appearing in Exhibit 1 were derived from the properties which together with their valuations appear in Exhibit 3 of the defendant.'\n\n The second paragraph of the stipulation is rather obscure and the exhibits are in a very condensed form, but all are elucidated by the opinions below and the briefs here. They mean, when read with these aids, that the plaintiff has large properties in the Philippines, consisting of real estate, stocks in private corporations and money loaned at interest, all of which are held and used as sources from which to obtain funds or revenue for carrying on its religious, charitable and educational work; that the bulk of its income consists of rents, dividends and interest derived from these properties; that the rest of its income is relatively small and comes from alms for mass, profits from occasional sales of some of its stocks, and sums received, in excess of cost, for wine, chocolate and other articles purchased and supplied for use in its churches, missions, parsonages, schools, and other subordinate agencies. The proportions in which these several items contributed to its income for the year covered by the tax in question are shown in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The defendant concedes that the plaintiff is organized and operated for religious, charitable and educational purposes and that no part of its net income inures to the benefit of any stockholder or individual, but contends that \n\n[263 U.S. 578, 581]\n\u00a0\n it is not 'operated exclusively' for those purposes, and therefore is not within the exception in the taxing act. Stated in another way, the contention is that the plaintiff is operated also for business and commercial purposes in that it uses its properties to produce income, and trades in wine, chocolate and other articles. In effect, the contention puts aside as immaterial the fact that the income from the properties is devoted exclusively to religious, charitable and educational purposes, and also the fact that the limited trading, if it can be called such, is purely incidental to the pursuit of those purposes, and is in no sense a distinct or external venture.\n Whether the contention is well taken turns primarily on the meaning of the excepting clause, before quoted from the taxing act. Two matters apparent on the face of the clause go far towards settling its meaning. First, it recognizes that a corporation may be organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific or educational purposes, and yet have a net income. Next, it says nothing about the source of the income, but makes the destination the ultimate test of exemption.\n Evidently the exemption is made in recognition of the benefit which the public derives from corporate activities of the class named, and is intended to aid them when not conducted for private gain. Such activities cannot be carried on without money; and it is common knowledge that they are largely carried on with income received from properties dedicated to their pursuit. This is particularly true of many charitable, scientific and educational corporations and is measurably true of some religious corporations. Making such properties productive to the end that the income may be thus used does not alter or enlarge the purposes for which the corporation is created and conducted. This is recognized in University v. People, \n99 U.S. 309\n, 324 (25 L. Ed. 387), where this court said:\n'The purpose of a college or university is to give \n\n[263 U.S. 578, 582]\n\u00a0\n youth an education. The money which comes from the sale or rent of land dedicated to that object aids this purpose. Land so held and leased is held for school purposes, in the fullest and clearest sense.'\n\n To the same effect is Methodist Episcopal Church South v. Hinton, 92 Tenn. 188, 200, 21 S. W. 321. And in our opinion the excepting clause, taken according to its letter and spirit, proceeds on this view of the subject.\n The plaintiff, being a corporation sole, has no stockholders. It is the legal representative of an ancient religious order the members of which have, among other vows, that of poverty. According to the Philippine law under which it is created, all of its properties are held for religious, charitable and educational purposes; and according to the facts stipulated it devotes and applies to those purposes all of the income- rents, dividends and interest-from such properties. In using the properties to produce the income, it therefore is adhering to and advancing those purposes, and not stepping aside from them or engaging in a business pursuit.\n As respects the transactions in wine, chocolate and other articles, we think they do not amount to engaging in trade in any proper sense of the term. It is not claimed that there is any selling to the public or in competition with others. The articles are merely bought and supplied for use within the plaintiff's own organization and agencies-some of them for strictly religious use, and the others for uses which are purely incidental to the work which the plaintiff is carrying on. That the transactions yield some profit is in the circumstances a negligible factor. Financial gain is not the end to which they are directed.\n Our conclusion is that the plaintiff is organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of the excepting clause.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rents (pesos) 90,092.70 Dividends 96,465.54 Interest 54,239.19 Sale of stocks 250.80 Sale of wine 2,711.15 Sale of chocolate 3,219.21 Sale of other articles 1,249.10 Alms for mass 6,475.00 ___ (pesos) 254,702.69\n\n\n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTWIN FALLS SALMON RIVER LAND & WATER CO. v. CALDWELL(1924)\n\nArgued: March 3, 1924Decided: October 27, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 85, 86]\n\u00a0\n Oliver O. Haga and James H. Richards, both of Boise, Idaho, for appellants.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 85, 87]\n\u00a0\n James R. Bothwell, of Twin Falls, Idaho, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal presents a controversy over an assessment for operation and maintenance of the Salmon River irrigation project in the state of Idaho.\n In 1914 eight settlers under the project, for themselves and all others similarly situated, brought a suit in equity in the United States District Court to obtain a comprehensive adjudication of various disputes which had arisen respecting the relative rights and obligations of the parties interested in the project; the court's jurisdiction being invoked because of the involution of the construction and application of Carey Act, c. 301,  4, 28 Stat. 422 (Comp. St.  4685), and its amendments. The principal defendant was the company which had contracted with the state to construct the irrigation works and to sell necessary water rights to settlers, and another was the company which was to operate and maintain the works when completed, but which was as yet under the control of the construction company. The early proceedings in the suit are reported in 225 F. 584, and 242 F. 177, 155 C. C. A. 17.\n In 1919, while that suit was still pending, the two companies-one still under the control of the other-made and sought to collect from the settlers an assessment of 50 cents per acre to defray the cost of work about to be done on a section of the irrigation works called the check basin. The assessment was made as part of an annual maintenance charge which the settlers were to bear; but they refused to pay because they regarded the work as construction work the cost of which was to be borne by the construction company. The companies threatened to shut off the water if payment was not made; and one of the plaintiffs in the equity suit, for himself and all other settlers, brought an action in a court of the state \n\n[266 U.S. 85, 88]\n\u00a0\n to have the assessment annulled and to enforce delivery of the water.\n During a subsequent hearing in the equity suit the defendants therein, who were also defendants in the action brought in the state court, presented to the District Court a petition setting forth the institution of that action, alleging there was such relation between the two proceedings that their prosecution in distinct tribunals would embarrass the parties and lead to possible conflicts of authority, and praying for an injunction against the prosecution of the proceeding in the state court. An informal, but extended, discussion followed, in which counsel on both sides recognized the propriety of drawing the whole matter into the District Court. Counsel for the plaintiffs took the position that, if the injunction was granted, there should be some provision assuring prompt repayment to the settlers if the assessment was collected and their objection to it afterwards was sustained by the court. Counsel for the defendants assented to this and indicated that the defendants or some of them stood ready to give a bond of that character. Accordingly the court, with the full acquiescence of the parties, entered an interlocutory order ( a) enjoining the prosecution of the action in the state court, (b) requiring the construction company within a limited time to execute a bond to repay within 30 days all moneys collected on the assessment if the court determined it was a construction charge to be borne by that company rather than a maintenance charge to be collected from the settlers, and (c) enjoining the collection of the assessment if the bond so required was not given. The bond was given and the settlers paid the assessment. Subsequently, after a due hearing, the court rendered a decree determining that the work was construction work the cost of which was to be borne by the construction company, and requiring that company to repay to the settlers within thirty days the amounts collected from them. \n\n[266 U.S. 85, 89]\n\u00a0\n The defendants appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which at first reversed the decree, but later in the same term, on finding that it had proceeded on a mistaken understanding of the circumstances in which the District Court came to adjudicate the controversy, changed the reversal into a decree of affirmance. 272 F. 356. The appeal to this court is from that decree.\n\n 1. \nThe defendants complain that the Circuit Court of Appeals, in changing its decision, acted on an application for rehearing and evidence submitted therewith without granting a rehearing.\n It is true that the change in decision was prompted by an application for rehearing, but not that any evidence was submitted with the application. What the defendants refer to as evidence was not such, but was a supplemental transcript containing their petition for an injunction against the prosecution in the state court of the action relating to the assessment. The petition had not been included in the original transcript sent to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that court, finding no pleading relating to the controversy over the assessment, held that the District Court had no occasion to adjudicate the controversy, and accordingly reversed its decree. When that decision was announced, the plaintiffs obtained the supplemental transcript, and, under a prior stipulation permitting omissions in the record to be supplied, filed it in the Circuit Court of Appeals with an application for rehearing. The court then recalled its first decision and substituted another, dealing with the merits of the controversy and affirming the decree. The second decision was given at the same term as the first, and therefore while the matter was still within the court's control. An examination of the two transcripts shows that the supplemental one served only to bring sharply to the court's attention what already appeared in the original-that the controversy was laid before the District Court in circumstances \n\n[266 U.S. 85, 90]\n\u00a0\n which made it admissible and appropriate for the court to proceed to its adjudication. Among other things, the original transcript set forth at length the discussion had when the defendants presented the petition for an injunction, and also contained the interlocutory order made at the time and the bond given under that order. The discussion, as set forth, disclosed the substance and purpose of the petition, the nature of the controversy over the assessment and a tacit consent of the parcies that the matter be dealt with on the lines followed in the interlocutory order and bond. The ultimate decree recited that it was rendered after a hearing had under the order and bond. In short, the original transcript showed such a submission of the controversy that the absence from the record of the petition for an injunction was not material.\n In our opinion it was quite admissible in the circumstances for the Circuit Court of Appeals to change its first decision and correct the mistake therein by disposing of the merits without granting a rehearing. The parties had been fully heard in the beginning.\n\n 2. \nThe defendants further complain that, in adjudging that the moneys collected on the assessment should be repaid to the settlers, the court failed to give proper effect to what the state land board had done in the matter and encroached on the board's province.\n By the laws of the state the board is invested with authority to supervise the fulfilment of contracts for the construction of irrigation works under the Carey Act and to accept the work when completed. But One of the state laws, Sess. Laws 1917, c. One of the state laws, Sess. Laws 1917, .c. 14, requires that assessments for the operation and maintenance of such works, where the operating company has not come under the control of the settlers, which was the case here, shall be submitted to and receive the approval of the board before payment is exacted. This assessment was submitted to the board, and the \n\n[266 U.S. 85, 91]\n\u00a0\n settlers objected that it was not for operation or maintenance but for construction. A hearing resulted in the adoption by the board of a resolution declaring that it was not then prepared to pass definitely on the matter, and would secure further data during the approaching irrigation season on which to rest a definite conclusion, but that it would temporarily approve the assessment as one for maintenance. In order that the money might be collected and the work proceed, and, if it ultimately concluded that the work was construction work, it would require the amounts collected to be applied as credits on the settlers' contracts for water rights or to be repaid in cash. This was not satisfactory to the settlers, so the matter was taken into court as before shown.\n It is not necessary to consider what effect should be given to an unqualified approval by the board, for there was none here. In effect what the board did was to say:\n'We cannot determine from the data before us whether the work, to pay for which the assessment is made, is construction work which the construction company is bound to do, or is maintenance the cost of which is to be collected from the settlers, so we reserve that question for future investigation and determination; but to tide the matter over we now give the assessment a merely tentative approval, and if we ultimately determine that the work is construction work we shall see that the settlers receive credit on their water-right contracts for the amounts collected or that they are repaid.'\n\n The state law makes it a condition to giving an approval that the board be 'satisfied' that the proposed expenditures 'are necessary for the operation and maintenance' of the irrigation works and 'are proper charges against' the settlers. This prerequisite was plainly wanting, as is affirmatively shown by the board's resolution, and therefore the tentative approval, only formally given, was in contravention of the statute and of no effect. The law also makes the board's approval a condition to the right to collect an assessment, \n\n[266 U.S. 85, 92]\n\u00a0\n and of course, where the board does not approve, it can give no authority to collect. As the collection was made without the prescribed approval, and therefore without right, the settlers were entitled to repayment. The state law does not purport, nor has it been construed, to vest the board with power to adjudicate rights to repayment of moneys thus wrongfully collected; so their adjudication in the courts is not an encroachment on the province of the board.\n\n 3. \nIt is also complained that the findings of fact on which the decree rests are not in accord with the evidence.

LLOYDS(1924)\nNo. 940\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. William Otis Badger, Jr., of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Hugh B. Rowland, of Washington, D. C., and\nHerbert Barry and Archibald G. Thacher, both of New York City, for defendant in error. \n\n[265 U.S. 454, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Averring that it was the owner of a floating dry dock at Havana, Cuba, which had sunk and become a total loss, plaintiff in error, a Delaware corporation, filed its bill of complaint in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York to recover upon a policy of marine insurance covering the dock. The policy was alleged to have been issued by certain enumerated Lloyds Underwriters Syndicates, each transacting business as an unincorporated association of more than seven persons under the name and style of Lloyds Underwriters, Lloyds, Lloyds London, or Underwriting Members of Lloyds. The service of process was made upon one Fowler, agent in New York City, for Lloyds, a corporation alleged to be the treasurer, or acting as the treasurer, for each of the underwriting associations. The corporation Lloyds, appearing specially, moved to quash the service on the grounds that the policy sued upon constituted the separate and not joint contracts of the individual underwriters who had signed the same; that Lloyds was not the treasurer or acting in the capacity of treasurer for the underwriters upon said policy or for any association or associations of underwriters; and that the service on Fowler, as its agent, was therefore null and void. Plaintiff challenged these assertions and urged that the service in question was valid under the provisions of a New York statute authorizing service to be made upon unincorporated associations consisting of more than seven persons by delivery of process to the president or treasurer of the association or upon the person acting in such capacity.\n The District Court, being of opinion that defendant's objections were well taken, made and signed an order on April 10, 1923, quashing the service as of no effect. More \n\n[265 U.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n than three months thereafter, to wit, on October 11, 1923, plaintiff was allowed a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals to review said order. When the writ of error came on for hearing in the Court of Appeals, that court held that it was without jurisdiction to entertain it, as the sole question presented by the record concerned the jurisdiction of the District Court, and review could be had only in this court. It accordingly ordered the case transferred to this court pursuant to the Act of September 14, 1922 (chapter 305, 42 Stat. 837 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1215a]), which provides that where, on appeal or writ of error, a case is taken from a District Court to the wrong appellate court, that is, to a Circuit Court of Appeals when it should have been taken directly to this court, or to this court when it should have been taken to a Circuit Court of Appeals, the appeal or writ of error shall not for that reason be dismissed, but shall be transferred to the proper court, which shall thereupon proceed with the case as though review had originally been sought in that court.\n Appellee now moves in this court to dismiss the writ of error, or in the alternative to remand the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals, because the writ was not sued out until after the expiration of the three- months period following entry of the judgment or decree complained of within which, under section 6 of the Act of September 6, 1916 (chapter 448, 39 Stat. 726, 728 Comp. St.  1228a), a writ of error, appeal, or writ of certiorari must be applied for to give this court jurisdiction to entertain it. In support of its motion, appellee relies upon the recent decision of this court in McMillan Co. v. Abernathy, \n263 \nU.S. 438, 443\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 200, 202, 68 L. Ed. --, wherein it was said:\n'We do not think the act of 1922 applies to any case in which the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals is taken after the period for appeals to this court has expired. Otherwise the act will enable one who negligently allowed his right of appeal to this court to go by, \n\n[265 U.S. 454, 457]\n\u00a0\n to take his appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals and by transfer get into this court, and thus lengthen the time for direct appeals to this court from three to six months. This result we can not assume Congress intended.'\n\n In view of this ruling, it is obvious that the failure in the present case to sue out the writ of error until after the expiration of three months from the entry of the District Court's order deprives this court of jurisdiction to entertain the writ, and that the transfer of the case from the Circuit Court of Appeals to this court was without sanction in the act of 1922. We can only send the case back to the Circuit Court of Appeals for its disposition.\n The motion to dismiss is therefore denied, and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S EX REL BALDWIN, CO. v.

The trade- marks were one for the word 'Howard,' accompanied by the initials 'V. G. P. Co.' arranged in a monogram, dated March 8, 1898, and the other the word 'Howard' printed or impressed in a particular and distinctive manner, dated October 17, 1905. The R. S. Howard Company came into the case as an intervener, and filed an answer denying the right of the complainant \n\n[265 U.S. 168, 176]\n\u00a0\n to continue to enjoy such registrations, and resisting the injunction to prevent the cancellation. The Commissioner of Patents, as defendant, also filed an answer denying the right of the complainant to the relief sought. The intervener also filed a motion to dismiss the bill for lack of jurisdiction in the court to entertain it. The court denied the motion to dismiss the bill and enjoined cancellation pending the final disposition of the cause. An appeal from this interlocutory order was taken under section 7 of the Act of February 9, 1893, establishing the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (27 Stat. 434, c. 74). The Court of Appeals reversed the Supreme Court and remanded the cause, with instructions to dismiss the bill. Appeal to this court was sought and allowed under section 250 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1227), which provides as follows:\n'Any final judgment or decree of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia may be re-examined and affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon writ of error or appeal, in the following cases:\n\n'First. In cases in which the jurisdiction of the trial court is in issue; but when any such case is not otherwise reviewable in said Supreme Court, then the question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified to said Supreme Court for decision.\n\n ...\n'Sixth. In cases in which the construction of any law of the United States is drawn in question by the defendant.'\n\n The errors assigned were the holding that the Supreme Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the suit, and the direction to dismiss the bill on that account. In addition to the appeal, the appellee in the Court of Appeals petitioned for a certiorari which is now pending.\n As the decree of the Court of Appeals directs the dismissal of the bill for lack of jurisdiction, it is a final decree. \n\n[265 U.S. 168, 177]\n\u00a0\n Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 44\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 221. As the court based its conclusion upon the construction of section 9 of the Trade-Mark Act (33 Stat. 727 [Comp. St.  9494]), and section 4915, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  9460), which was specifically drawn in question by the intervener, and necessarily by the defendant in his answer in denying the complainant's right to relief as claimed by him in his bill under said two sections, we think the appeal was rightfully allowed and that the petition for certiorari should be denied.\n The controversy between the parties litigant has had several phases. In August, 1914, R. S. Howard & Co. sought to cancel the registration of the two trade-marks of Baldwin & Co., already referred to, by application to the Commissioner. The Commissioner refused, but upon appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District the decision of the Commissioner was reversed, and this was duly certified to the Commissioner. 48 App. D. C. 437. The Baldwin Company appealed to this court and filed an application for a certiorari as well. The appeal was dismissed and the certiorari denied on the ground that the certificate of the Court of Appeals to the Commissioner was not a final judgment, reviewable here upon appeal or certiorari. \n256 U.S. 35\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 405. This was April 11, 1921, and on May 7, 1921, the Baldwin Company filed the original bill in this case in the Supreme Court of the District against the Commissioner of Patents, seeking an injunction against the canceling of the trade-marks in question. By an amended bill, there was set forth the record in a suit between R. S. Howard & Co. and Baldwin & Co. in New York, resulting in an injunction against the use of the word 'Howard' without prefix or suffix by the R. S. Howard Company in sales of pianos. 233 Fed. 439; 238 Fed. 154, 151 C. C. A. 230.\n The main question we have here to consider is whether by the statutes applicable to procedure in settling controversies over the registration of trade-marks in interstate \n\n[265 U.S. 168, 178]\n\u00a0\n and foreign trade, a remedy by bill in equity to enjoin the Commissioner of Patents from canceling a registered trade-mark is given to the owner of the trade-mark so registered. We are to find the answer in section 9 of the Trade-Mark Act (33 Stat. 727, c. 592) and in section 4915 of the Revised Statutes. Section 9 provides as follows:\n'That if an applicant for registration of a trade-mark, or a party to an interference as to a trade-mark, or a party who has filed opposition to the registration of a trade-mark, or party to an application for the cancellation of the registration of a trade-mark, is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, he may appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, on complying with the conditions required in case of an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner by an applicant for patent, or a party to an interference as to an invention, and the same rules of practice and procedure shall govern in every stage of such proceedings, as far as the same may be applicable.'\n\n Section 4915, R. S., provides as follows:\n'Whenever a patent on application is refused, either by the Commissioner of Patents or by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia upon appeal from the Commissioner, the applicant may have remedy by bill in equity; and the court having cognizance thereof, on notice to adverse parties and other due proceedings had, may adjudge that such applicant is entitled, according to law, to receive a patent for his invention, as specified in his claim, or for any part thereof, as the facts in the case may appear. And such adjudication, if it be in favor of the right of the applicant, shall authorize the Commissioner to issue such patent on the applicant filing in the Patent Office a copy of the adjudication, and otherwise complying with the requirements of law. In all cases, where there is no opposing party, a copy of the bill shall be served on the Commissioner; and all the expenses \n\n[265 U.S. 168, 179]\n\u00a0\n of the proceeding shall be paid by the applicant, whether the final decision is in his favor or not.'\n\n We have held that the assimilation of the practice in respect of the registration of trade-marks to that in securing patents as enjoined by section 9 of the Trade-Mark Act makes section 4915, R. S., providing for a bill in equity to compel the Commissioner of Patents to issue a patent, applicable to a petition for the registration of a trade-mark when rejected by the Commissioner. American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, Commissioner of Patents, \n262 U.S. 209\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 541; Baldwin Company v. Howard Company, \n256 \nU.S. 35, 39\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 405; Atkins & Co. v. Moore, \n212 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 390.\n The present case presents this difference. The defeated party in the hearing before the Commissioner is not asking registration of a trade-mark, but is seeking to prevent the cancellation of trade-marks already registered. Section 9 provides for appeals to the District Court of Appeals, not only for a defeated applicant for registration of a trade- mark, but also for a dissatisfied party to an interference as to a trade- mark, a dissatisfied party who has filed opposition to the registration of a trade-mark and a dissatisfied party to an application for the cancellation of the registration of a trade-mark. It seems clear that the complainant below was a dissatisfied party to an application for the cancellation of the registration of a trade-mark. We think that both the applicant for cancellation and the registrant opposing it are given the right of appeal to the District Court of Appeals under that section.\n The next inquiry is whether in addition to such appeal and after it proves futile, the applicant is given a remedy by bill in equity as provided for a defeated applicant for a patent in section 4915, R. S. We have in the cases cited given the closing words of section 9 a liberal construction in the view that Congress intended by them to give every \n\n[265 U.S. 168, 180]\n\u00a0\n remedy in respect to trade-marks that is afforded in proceedings as to patents, and have held that under them a bill of equity is afforded to a defeated applicant for trade-mark registration just as to a defeated applicant for a patent. It is not an undue expansion of that construction to hold that the final words were intended to furnish a remedy in equity against the Commissioner in every case in which by section 9 an appeal first lies to the Court of Appeals. This necessarily would give to one defeated by the Commissioner as a party to an application for the cancellation of the registration of a trade-mark, after an unsuccessful appeal to the advisory supervision of the Court of Appeals, a right to resort to an independent bill in equity against the Commissioner to prevent cancellation.\n It is pointed out as militating against our interpretation of section 9 and an assimilation of trade-mark procedure to that in the case of patents that after a patent issues, there is no proceeding provided by which a patent can be cancelled, except on suit of the United States. Mowry v. Whithey, 14 Wall. 434, 439; United States v. Bell Tel. Co., \n128 \nU.S. 315, 368\n, 370 S., 9 Sup. Ct. 90; United States v. Am. Bell Tel. Co., \n159 \nU.S. 548, 555\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 69. Briggs v. United Shoe Machinery Co., \n239 \nU.S. 48, 50\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 6. That is true, but a registration of a trade-mark may be canceled, and the purpose of Congress by section 9 of the Trade-Mark Act was to give to defeated applicants in the Court of Appeals the same resort to a court of equity as was given to defeated applicants for patents so far as the same was applicable. The applicants in section 9 were of four kinds and to each of them were intended to be accorded the same resort to the Court of Appeals and the same remedy in equity as to the applicant for a patent in section 4915. The inherent differences between trade-marks and patents should not prevent our giving effect to the remedial purpose of Congress in carrying out the analogies between the two classes of privileges to secure a common procedure. \n\n[265 U.S. 168, 181]\n\u00a0\n The argument is made that section 9 should not be held to authorize the use of a suit in equity for all of the four cases in which appeals are provided to the Court of Appeals from the Commissioner and are unsuccessful, because by section 22 of the same act (Comp. St.  9507) there is a special provision for a remedy in equity where there are interfering registered trade-marks. It is said this excludes the inforence that such a remedy is also provided in section 9, on the principle 'expressio unius exclusio alterius.' An examination of section 22 shows that it refers to an independent suit between claimants of trade-marks, both of which have already been registered. The Commissioner is not a party to such litigation, but is subject to the decree of the court after it is entered. It is just like the proceeding in section 4918 (Comp. St.  9463) to settle controversies between interfering patents already granted by the Patent Office. Section 9 of the Trade-Mark Act is wider than section 22 in its scope. It includes one who applies for registration of an unregistered trade-mark which interferes with one already registered.\n On the whole, we think that our decision in American Steel Foundries Co. v. Robertson, \n262 U.S. 209\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 541, leads us necessarily to sustain the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the District to entertain this bill.\n Finally it is objected that this bill was not in time. It was filed more than two years and two months after the decision of the Court of Appeals in the first appeal from the Commissioner of Patents. It is contended that under Gandy v. Marble, \n122 U.S. 432\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1290, section 4894, R. S., applies to any bill in equity under section 4915, and compels the dismissal of the bill if it is not prosecuted within one year after the adverse decision in the Court of Appeals, unless it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the delay was unavoidable. In re Hien, \n166 \nU.S. 432, 438\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 624; American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, \n262 \nU.S. 209, 212\n, 213 S., 43 Sup. Ct. 541.

In 1921 he was arrested in deportation proceedings, as an alien in this country in violation of law. Act Oct. 16, 1918, c. 186,  1 and 2, 40 Stat. 1012, as amended by Act June 5, 1920, c. 251, 41 Stat. 1008. After a hearing, the warrant for deportation issued. Then this petition for a writ of habeas corpus was brought in the federal court. It was dismissed without opinion; the relator was remanded to the custody of the commissioner of immigration for the port of New York; and a stay was granted, pending this appeal. The case is here under section 238 of the Judicial Code; the claim being that Mensevich was denied rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution.\n The government moved under rule 6 of this court to dismiss, insisting that the appeal does not present a substantial question. Consideration of the motion was postponed until the hearing on the merits. The grounds on which the detention was challenged in the petition are the same as those which were held to be unsound in \n\n[264 U.S. 134, 136]\n\u00a0\n United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, \n263 U.S. 149\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 54, 68 L. Ed. --. That decision was not rendered until after this appeal was taken. The motion to dismiss is therefore denied. Sugarman v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 182, 183\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 191. In the traverse to the return the legality of the detention is challenged on a further ground. That ground would not have entitled the relator to bring the case here by appeal. For the only substantial question thus presented is one of the construction of a statute. But, since the case is properly here, this objection must be considered. Compare Zucht v. King, \n260 \nU.S. 174, 176\n, 177 S., 43 Sup. Ct. 24.\n Immigration Act Feb. 5, 1917, c. 29,  20, 39 Stat. 874, 890 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 k), provides that the deportation of aliens 'shall, at the option of the Secretary of Labor, be to the country whence they came or to the foreign port at which such aliens embarked for the United States.' Mensevich was ordered deported 'to Poland, the country whence he came.' He insists that the warrant for deportation is illegal, because prior to his emigration to the United States he had been a resident of Tychny, in the province of Grodno, then a part of Russia; that, at the time the warrant for deportation issued, Grodno had not been recognized by the United States as a part of Poland; and hence that it should have been treated by the Secretary States as a part of Poland; and hence that it should have been treated by the Secretary of Labor as being still a part of Russia. The facts are that, when the warrant for deportation issued and when the judgment below was entered, Grodno was occupied and administered by Poland; that there was then a dispute between Poland and the Soviet Republic concerning the boundary line between them; and that the United States, while officially recognizing Poland, had not recognized Grodno as being either within or without its boundaries.\n The term 'country' is used in section 20 to designate, in general terms, the state which at the time of deportation, includes the place from which the alien came. Whether \n\n[264 U.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n territory occupied and administered by a country, but not officially recognized as being a part of it, is to be deemed a part for the purposes of this section, we have no occasion to consider; for, since the entry of the judgment below, the Treaty of Riga has so defined the eastern boundary of Poland as to include Grodno, and the United States has officially recognized this boundary line. Grodno is now confessedly a part of Poland. The validity of a detention questioned by a petition for habeas corpus is to be determined by the condition existing at the time of the final decision thereon. Stallings v. Splain, \n253 \nU.S. 339, 343\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 537. Deportation to Poland is now legal.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S EX REL ST LOUIS SOUTHWESTERN R. CO. v.

Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 St. 379, as amended by Act of March 1, 1913, c. 92, 37 St. 701, and Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91, \n\n[264 U.S. 64, 75]\n\u00a0\n  433, 41 St. 456, 474, 493 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8591). Obeying this section the Interstate Commerce Commission made a tentative valuation of the relator's property and served it upon the relator, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company, in July, 1921. In due time the relator filed its protest against the valuation, as provided by the Act, especially against the findings of the final value of the property, the cost of reproduction new, the cost of reproduction less depreciation, present value of relator's lands, and the present cost of condemnation and damages or of purchase of lands in excess of present value. In July, 1922, the Commission, as required, made an order setting the matter down for hearing in Washington on September 26, 1922. On July 20 the relator filed a motion with the Commission praying for an order allowing it to examine the underlying data upon which the valuation was based, and for a subpoena duces tecum to named officers of the Commission directing them to bring with them to the hearing all the data in any way relating to the matter in issue. In August the Commission cancelled the hearing and in October made an order to the following effect. It recited that the opening of certain records to inspection before they were offered in evidence before the Commission in hearings upon protests or before a court of competent jurisdiction, would be detrimental to the public interest; would make it impossible to secure as uninfluenced opinions upon land values and price and cost information as the Commission could otherwise; would unnecessarily prolong the work, and greatly increase the expense; and would seriously interfere with due performance of the regular duties of the Commission's employes. It therefore ordered that until further order, office or field notations, etc., in the Bureau of Valuation; opinions and correspondence from or to any employe thereof; land field notes; land computation sheets; cost information secured from others than the carrier in question; cost studies and \n\n[264 U.S. 64, 76]\n\u00a0\n cost analyses prepared by the Bureau of Valuation, should not be open to inspection by other than the employes of the Commission unless and until offered in evidence at hearings or before a Court as above.\n Thereupon the relator filed the present petition for mandamus in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. It sets forth the foregoing facts in detail and annexes a copy of the valuation, with the Commission's statement of the kinds of proof and methods used in making its findings, and further statement that those findings were based upon certain underlying facts compiled by the employes of the Bureau of Valuation, these underlying facts being indicated at some length. They embraced contracts for materials made over the whole country for the ten years ending June 30, 1914; contracts for constructing railroads or parts during the same time; actual expenditures for various classes of construction work in unidentified projects selected by the Bureau; books, vouchers and invoices of materials, etc., used in construction during the same time; undisclosed records purporting to show the service life of various classes of material, etc., together with an inspection report by the Bureau's engineers showing the age of the materials, etc., in relator's railroad. From such data, classified and selected, compilations and analyses were made purporting to show average cost of materials, etc., and the average ratios of engineering and general expenses during construction and interest during construction to cost of construction in selected projects, and the average service, life, age, etc., of the various units of property in relator's railroad. These compilations were used as the basis for finding cost of reproduction new and cost of reproduction less depreciation in the relator's case. Similarly the present value of relator's lands is said to have been reached upon uncommunicated data which it is not necessary to repeat, and the present cost of condemnation or damage or of \n\n[264 U.S. 64, 77]\n\u00a0\n purchase in excess of the present value of relator's land is said to have been reached in the same general way. The foregoing data are alleged to have been reduced to writing and to be within the control of the Commission. It is alleged that much of the information gathered was not under oath and that many statements were made orally and that many opinions were taken from persons not qualified to express the same.\n The relators prayed for an order directing the Commission to allow it to examine these underlying data, contracts, reports, compilations and records of the Bureau of Valuation so far as in any way related to valuation of the relator's property, and to make written and photographic copies of the same. It also asked that the Commission be directed to issue subpoenas to named officers as in the motion made to the Commission stated above. On a motion to that effect the petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court and the judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. We are of opinion that the judgment was right, and will indicate not only the grounds of our decision but what we think that the relator reasonably may demand.\n The relator's claim of right has for its broadest basis the fact that the valuation when made final by the Commission will be prima facie evidence in various judicial proceedings in which the value of the property is material to the decision of the case. But the legislature may make one fact prima facie evidence of another if the inference is not 'so unreasonable as to be a purely arbitrary mandate.' Lindsley v.

If Congress had given no hearing before the Commission but still had made its conclusion prima facie evidence of value, it would be hard to say that any constitutional rights of the railroads had been infringed. Reitler v. Harris. \n223 U.S. 437\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 248; Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 412, 430\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691. The strongest basis for the relator's claim is the statute itself. \n\n[264 U.S. 64, 78]\n\u00a0\n The statute provides that:\n'Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, with the reasons therefor, the records and data of the Commission shall be open to the inspection and examination of the public.'\n\n The Commission has ordered otherwise as we have stated and the order puts an end to the claim to examine the data on the naked ground that they are public documents. But as the statute provides for a hearing before the Commission it does not follow necessarily that the parties to the proceeding are subject to the same rule when the data are desired as evidence. The hearing to be sure is not of the ordinary kind. The railroads have no adversary. The Commission of course has no object except to arrive at the truth. It is not to be cross-examined for bias or otherwise as to its capacity to decide or modes of deciding what is entrusted to it, but on the other hand since it must grant a hearing manifest justice requires that the railroads should know the facts that the Commission supposes to be established and we presume that it would desire the grounds of its tentative valuation to be subjected to searching tests. But there are necessary limits. While there can be no public policy or relation of confidence that should prevail against the paramount claim of the roads, the work of the Commission must go on, and cannot be stopped as it would be if many of the railroads concerned undertook an examination of all its papers to see what they could find out. We need not now consider whether the statute authorizes the order if it be construed to apply to cases like the present for we cannot doubt that this Commission will do all in its power to help the relator to whatever it justly may demand. As yet it has made no just demand, for we accept the Commission's statement that a general examination in the Commission's office would interfere too much with its work. Moreover at the hearing there will be limits, at the discretion of the Commission, to the right to delay the sittings by minute inquiries \n\n[264 U.S. 64, 79]\n\u00a0\n that might protract them indefinitely. See Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n258 \nU.S. 165, 175\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 264. But subject to that discretion we think that in such way as may be found practicable the relator should be enabled to examine and meet the preliminary data upon which the conclusions are founded, and to that end should be given further information in advance of the hearing, sufficient to enable it to point out errors if any there be. No present need is shown for the issue of subpoenas, and with this intimation of our views of the Railroad's rights we repeat our opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","184":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. CHILDS(1924)\nNo. 80\nArgued: Decided: November 24, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Mr. Sewall Key, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner. \n\n[266 U.S. 304, 305]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Moses Cohen, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 304, 306]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The collector of internal revenue of the Second district of New York filed a claim against the trustee in bankruptcy of J. Menist Company, Inc., Edward H. Childs, in the sum of $2,421.75, plus 5 per cent. penalty and 1 per cent. interest per month thereon until paid. The claim was for an additional income tax for the year 1917\n\n\n The justification for the claim, as stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals, is:\n'Act of October 3, 1917 (40 Stat. 300,  212), making section 14a of the Act of September 8, 1916 (39 Stat. 756), applicable to taxes under the 1917 act.'\n\n By section 14a of title 1, part 2 of the act of 1916, it is provided that:\n'... To any sum or sums due and \n\n[266 U.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n unpaid after the fifteenth day of June in any year, or after one hundred and five days from the date on which the return of income is required to be made by the taxpayer, and after ten days' notice and demand thereof by the collector, there shall be added the sum of five per centum on the amount of tax unpaid and interest at the rate of one per centum per month upon said tax from the time the same becomes due.'\n\n As an element for consideration in connection with section 14a is section 57j of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9641). It reads as follows:\n'Debts owing to the United States, a state, a county, a district, or a municipality as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed except for the amount of pecuniary loss sustained by the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose, with reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby and such interest as may have accrued thereon according to law.'\n\n The government withdrew its claim for 5 per cent. penalty, but urged its claim for 1 per cent. interest.\n The referee, however, decided that the cited provisions 'constitued a statutory characterization or definition, ...' not only as to the 5 per cent. penalty, but also in respect to the 1 per cent. interest per month, and relieved the estate in bankruptcy from its payment. He allowed the claim for $2,421.75, with interest at 6 per cent. per annum to the date of payment.\n The order was affirmed by the District Court. This was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and its action is now here for review.\n At the outset we are confronted with the difference between penalty and interest. A penalty is a means of punishment; interest a means of compensation. Bouvier defines it to be 'a consideration paid for the use of money or forbearance in demanding it when due.' This court has declined to give it peremptory definition, and construing statutes considered that it could 'safely decline \n\n[266 U.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n either to limit' the word 'debts' to 'existing dues, or to extend its meaning so as to embrace all dues of whatever origin and description.' Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 79. See, also, New Jersey v. Anderson, \n203 \nU.S. 483, 493\n, 27 S. Ct. 137. To what conclusion does like liberty of construction conduct in the present case?\n The imposition of a tax is certainly a function of government and creates an obligation, and the power that creates the obligation can assign the measure of its delinquency-the detriment of delay in payment, and section 14a has done so in this case, and explicitly done so. Five per centum penalty is the cost of delinquency, and interest upon the amount due at 1 per cent. per month-12 per cent. a year. There is no ambiguity in the declaration nor the distinction made. Against their clearness and completeness section 57j of the Bankruptcy Act is cited.\n The government yields as to the 5 per cent. penalty. It resists as to the 1 per cent. interest. The Circuit Court of Appeals considered that the 1 per cent. was involved, as well as being in effect penalty and not saved by its name, though it was imposed by the Legislature and within the legislative power, and notwithstanding that taxes are treated as debts within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act. In re Sherwoods, 210 F. 754, 758, 127 C. C. A. 304, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 940; Kaw Boiler Works v. Schull, 230 F. 587, 144 C. C. A. 641, L. R. A. 1916E, 628.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals adjudged the tax in the present case a debt and assigned against it interest at 6 per cent.; the court considering that that interest was compensation for the delinquency, anything in excess becoming penalty and within the prohibition of section 57j. The court said:\n'On the point at bar [1 per cent. interest as the price of the delay being penalty] we are in accord with In re Ashland, etc. (D. C.) 229 F. 829, and hold that, there being no evidence of any injury or damage to the government by the withholding of this tax, except that which flows from the nonpayment of a just debt, anything in excess of \n\n[266 U.S. 304, 309]\n\u00a0\n the legal rate of interest is to be treated as a penalty and not allowed.'\n\n We are unable to concur. It makes the rate of interest that of a particular locality, differing with the locality-in New York, as said by the government, 6 per cent.; in the Middle West, 8 per cent.; and on the Pacific Coast, 10 per cent.-and abridges or controls a federal statute by a local law or custom, and takes from it uniformity of operation. Besides, the federal statute is precise, and it is made peremptory by the distinction between 'penalty' and 'interest,' and if it may be conceded that the use of the latter word would not save it from condemnation if it were in effect the former, it cannot be conceded that 1 per cent. per month-12 per cent. a year-gives it that illegal effect, certainly not against legislative declaration that is within the legislative power, there being no ambiguity to resolve.\n To this conclusion New York v. Jersawit, \n263 \nU.S. 493\n, 44 S. Ct. 167, is not antagonistic. There a statute of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 60) was passed on which required 'every domestic corporation' to 'annually pay in advance ... an annual franchise tax' upon its net income for the year next preceding, and provided that, if the tax were not paid, the corporation should pay 'in addition to the amount of such tax ... ten per centum of such amount, plus one per centum for each month the tax ... remains unpaid.' This liability the lower federal courts pronounced a penalty and not to be allowed. In that conclusion this court concurred and decided that, being penalty, it was disallowed by Bankruptcy Act,  57j. And this not only because the 1 per centum was 'more than the value of the use of the money,' but because it was added by the statute to the 10 per cent. to make a single sum, and 'must be treated as part of one corpus, and must fall with that.'\n The tax in this case is one on income; a Interest is put upon it and so denominated, Interest is put upon it and so denominated, distinguished from the 5 per cent. as pen alty, \n\n[266 U.S. 304, 310]\n\u00a0\n clearly intended to compensate the delay in payment of the tax-the detriment of its nonpayment, to be continued during the time of its nonpayment-compensation, not punishment.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. FERRIS(1924)\nNo. 217\nArgued: April 8, 1924Decided: May 26, 1924\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n George A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit by the plaintiff, a lieutenant colonel of Field Artillery, National Army, in the service of the United States, to recover increased pay and allowances for exercising a command as colonel of Field Artillery from August 27, 1917, to January 5, 1918. His action is \n\n[265 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n based on section 7 of the Act of Congress of April 26, 1898, c. 191 (30 Stat. 364, 365), as follows:\n'That in time of war every officer serving with troops operating against an exemy who shall exercise, under assignment in orders issued by competent authority, a command above that pertaining to his grade, shall be entitled to receive the pay and allowances of the grade appropriate to the command so exercised. ...' Comp. St.  2093\n\n\n\n There is no dispute that the claimant is in every respect within the provision of this act except in the requirement that he was 'serving with troops operating against the enemy.' The Court of Claims held that this requirement was complied with, and gave judgment. 57 Ct. Cl. 566. The counsel for the government oppose this view and seek by this appeal to reverse the judgment.\n The claimant exercised his command as colonel over the 315th Field Artillery, which was part of the 80th Division of the National Army. The division was organized and trained at Camp Lee, Va., and later on became a part of the American Expeditionary Force and engaged in action with the enemy.\n During the whole period from August 22, 1917, to January, 1918, in which the claimant acted as colonel, the regiment was stationed at Camp Lee, Petersburg, Va., and this camp was used as a camp of instruction.\n Was this officer serving with troops operating against the enemy? The requirement is that the service shall not only be in time of war, but also with troops operating against the enemy. Troops in instruction camps across the ocean from the field of war cannot in any proper sense be held to be operating against the enemy. Camp instruction is doubtless a necessary preliminary step to effective operation against the enemy, but it does not constitute such operation. This act was passed during the Spanish War, and the Court of Claims rested its conclusion \n\n[265 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n on the opinion of the Attorney General, 22 Ops. Attys. Gen. 95, in which he held that troops assembled in camps of instruction in the United States were to be considered as operating against an enemy under the statute. We think that the construction is so at variance with the ordinary meaning of the language that we cannot follow it. It can hardly be said to have become the basis for a long executive construction and practice, because the Spanish War was soon over and the question of its application did not arise until the recent great war. We agree with the opinion of the Paymaster General in 1898 in this matter. He said:\n'As yet, although war has been declared to exist between Spain and the United States, there are, in my opinion, with the exception of the troops embarked for the Philippine Islands, no troops 'operating against an enemy.' There is, within our borders, no enemy, within the meaning of the law, for troops to operate against. An army has been called together, and is being drilled, disciplined, and prepared to operate against an enemy, but until that army embarks for a foreign country, or until an enemy appears on our shores and the army confronts it, it is held that no officer can receive the pay of a higher grade by virtue of anything in the act referred to.'\n\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed. \n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. GAY(1924)\nNo. 205\nArgued: March 11, 1924Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Asst. Atty. Gen. Lovett, for the United States.\n Mr. Geo. A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellee. \n\n[264 U.S. 353, 354]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal is for the review of a judgment of the Court of Claims for the sum of $10,302.52 in favor of the appellee for pay as a machinist on the retired list of the Navy from May 1, 1916, to June 13, 1922, at the rate of $1,687.50 per year.\n It is contested by the United States on the ground that Gay had ceased to be an American citizen. For this the Act of March 2, 1907 (34 Stat. 1228 [Comp. St.  3958-3964]), is adduced. And that he, having expatriated himself, abandoned his office as machinist in the Navy, the law and regulations requiring that officers of the Navy must in all cases be American citizens. The further contention is that from the date of abandonment he was not entitled to pay.\n The facts are not in dispute. Gay after serving as an enlisted man in the Navy was appointed, by warrant of the President, a warrant machinist, the title of which office was changed by subsequent legislation to machinist. He remained on the active list until November 23, 1908, when he was retired from active service on account of deafness.\n He was born in Switzerland, May 19, 1856, and was admitted to citizenship August 4, 1897, and had done no act inconsistent with his allegiance nor with his status as an officer of the Navy.\n On retirement he was given permission to leave the United States for three successive years and on August 30, 1912, he was authorized to remain abroad indefinitely. In accordance with the permission he has been residing in Switzerland, but has kept the Bureau of Navigation informed as to his address as required by the Naval Instructions. He made one or more affidavits of continued American citizenship before the American consul at Geneva. \n\n[264 U.S. 353, 355]\n\u00a0\n He was registered as an American citizen at that consulate and received a registration certificate. On November 25, 1912, he requested a renewal of his certificate, but was informed by the consul that, since he had lived over two years in Switzerland, the country of his birth, he would have to sign an affidavit to overcome the presumption of expatriation. He signed such affidavit and on November 26, 1912, he called at the consulate and asked that the affidavit not be sent to the Department of State.\n On January 11, 1916, he was notified by letter from the Navy Department that he had been selected for duty in connection with the Naval Intelligence Office in time of war and requested, in case of return to the United States and to Washington, to call at that office, but 'should you remain abroad indefinitely, and opportunity offer, it is requested that you confer with the naval attache at Paris.' The letter was transmitted to him through the naval attache at Paris, with request to acknowledge receipt, which he did on January 28, 1916\n\n\n On February 24, 1916, the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation of the Navy Department addressed him a copy of General Instructions issued to naval officers abroad directing them to notify the accredited naval attache of their presence, address and probable length of stay, etc., or if in countries or colonies to which no naval attache is accredited, to make similar report to the nearest United States naval attache practical.\n On March 15, 1916, in accordance with this order he notified the attache at Paris, giving particulars in regard to his residence, and expressing himself as ready and willing to leave Switzerland whenever recalled to the United States by the Navy Department.\n On March 17, 1916, the receipt of the letter was acknowledged, stating:\n'2. In case you are in the vicinity of Paris, I would be greatly obliged if you would call at the embassy in order to receive certain confidential information \n\n[264 U.S. 353, 356]\n\u00a0\n which I have been directed by the Navy Department to furnish you.\n\n'3. There is no immediate necessity of your coming to Paris at present.'\n\n On June 19, 1916, and again on July 25, 1916, he was notified by the pay officer of the New York Navy Yard, who had been carrying his accounts and paying his monthly retired pay, that he, the officer, had been directed by the Navy Department to make no further payments to him, Gay.\n On September 1, 1916, he wrote to the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation of the Navy Department, Washington, requesting to be informed of the reason for that action, stating that he was ready to answer at any time for his action. No response seems to have been made to his letter. On November 12, 1917, he informed the Bureau of Navigation that he was able to perform sea or shore duty, but in the following month it was officially stated that there was no duty to which he 'might be assigned.' His name appeared continuously on the officially published annual 'Register of the Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the Navy and Marine Corps' down to and including that of January 1, 1917. He is carried on it as a machinist on the retired list of the Navy, and under the column 'Present Residence or Duty' he is listed 'Abroad.' It does not appear by what authority his name was omitted from the register.\n The contention of the United States is that Gay having resided for over two years in Switzerland, the place of his birth, the presumption occurred that he had ceased to be an American citizen. And this presumption, it is further contended, was not overcome by 'the presentation of satisfactory evidence to a diplomatic or consular offcer of the United States, under such rules and regulations as the Department of State may prescribe.' Section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1907 (Comp. St.  3959), is cited for the contention. The section provides as follows:\n'When any naturalized citizen \n\n[264 U.S. 353, 357]\n\u00a0\n shall have resided for two years in the foreign state from which he came, or for five years in any other foreign state, it shall be presumed that he has ceased to be an American citizen, and the place of his general abode shall be deemed his place of residence during said years: Provided, however, that such presumption may be overcome on the presentation of satisfactory evidence to a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States, under such rules and regulations as the Department of State may prescribe: And provided also, that no American citizen shall be allowed to expatriate himself when this country is at war.'\n\n The contention puts out of view all of the other facts of the case. Puts out of view the rights of Gay as an officer of the Navy. To be such officer he had to be a citizen, but being such officer he had relations and rights besides those of citizenship. And this was recognized- recognized by him, and recognized by the Navy Department. His going and staying abroad was submitted to the judgment and permission of the department, first in yearly applications for three successive years and then by permission 'to remain abroad indefinitely.' He reported to the Bureau of Navigation his address each year as required by its regulations. The department was, therefore, enabled to and did inform him that he had been selected for duty, and directed him to confer with the naval attache at Paris, which he did, giving particulars in regard to his residence and willingness to respond to a call to duty. To this the attache responded as follows:\n'2. In case you are in the vicinity of Paris, I would be greatly obliged if you would call at the embassy in order to receive certain confidential information which I have been directed by the Navy Department to furnish you.\n\n'3. There is no immediate necessity for your coming to Paris at present.'\n\n Up to this moment of time, he was an officer in the Navy, one worthy of 'confidential information,' and it \n\n[264 U.S. 353, 358]\n\u00a0\n is to be remembered that a war was in progress, a war in which at any time this country might become engaged, and subsequently did become engaged. A discontinuance of his pay came soon after, it was as abrupt as it is unexplained, and we are induced to say inexplicable. Gay, we repeat, was an officer of the Navy, and as such he was subject to duties and as such he was entitled to rights; for neglect or violation of duty he was subject to reprimand and, it might be, punishment, but punnishment only after charge and conviction. Sections 1229 and 1624, R. S. (Comp. St.  2001, and section 2961 et seq.).1 This was his right even if there had been culpability in his actions. There was none. We find no act of dereliction in his retirement nor afterwards. All was done in submission to and under permission granted by the Navy Department in exercise of law. By that law his case must be judged. The act of March 2, 1907, has another purpose. That act had only to do with the action of a citizen as such, he having no other relations. His place of residence was an element in making him a citizen, it might be regarded as an element in continuing him a citizen and presumptions could be erected upon it, and we are prompted to say it is a presumption easy to preclude, and easy to overcome. It is a matter of option and intention.\n The relation of an officer of the Navy to his place of residence is entirely different. It is selected in submission to Navy regulations, subordinate to his duty, subject to change and, that it may be so, he must keep the Bureau \n\n[264 U.S. 353, 359]\n\u00a0\n of Navigation informed of it. To these conditions Gay was at all times in conformity.\n The finding of the Court of Claims is that:\n'He has always borne true faith and allegiance to the United States and had done no act inconsistent with his allegiance nor with his status as an officer of the United States Navy.'\n\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revised Statutes,  1624, being the Articles for the Government of the Navy, article 36 (Comp.

In \n\n[263 U.S. 515, 518]\n\u00a0\n each, carriers who were found to have unjustly discriminated against shippers of lumber located on an independent short line, were ordered by the Commission to cease and desist from charging them higher through rates than were contemporaneously charged for like services from other points within what is called blanket territory. \n1\n Each case was heard before three judges on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, on defendant's motion to dismiss the bill for want of equity, and on final hearing. In each the whole record before the Commission was introduced. In No. 40 the federal court for Southern Mississppi perpetually enjoined the enforcement of the order issued by the Commission in Swift Lumber Co. v. Fernwood & Gulf R. R. Co., 61 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 485. In No. 38 the federal court for Wyoming dismissed the bill, thus sustaining the order issued for the Commission in Pioneer Lumber Co. v. Director General, 64 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 485. Each case is here on direct appeal under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (Comp. St.  998).\n The facts in No. 40 present most of the questions of law requiring discussion. The so-called blanket territory, which extends south from Jackson, Miss., to the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 miles), and from the Mississippi river into Alabama, produces yellow pine lumber in quantity. Through this territory, the Illinois Central Railroad extends from New Orleans to Jackson and thence to the Ohio river crossings and leading lumber markets of the North. Partly by its main line, partly, also, by branches, and partly by connections with independent lines, it serves a large percentage of the lumber mills in the territory. From all these points on the \n\n[263 U.S. 515, 519]\n\u00a0\n Illinois Central main line, from all on its branches, from all on three independent short lines which connect indirectly with it, and from all on the Mississippi Central (a longer independent line which crosses it running east and west) the carriers have established the same through lumber rates to the Northern markets, regardless of the varying distances within the blanket territory. At Fernwood, Miss., a little south of its Monticello branch, the Illinois Central connects with the Fernwood & Gulf, an independent short line, on which the Swift Lumber Company has a mill at Knoxo. The distance from Knoxo to the junction is 27 miles. The joint through rate from Knoxo via Fernwood to Northern points, voluntarily established by these carriers, is 2 cents per 100 pounds higher than the rate from Fernwood, or any other point within the so-called blanket territory on the Illinois Central main or branch lines or on the connections mentioned above. The distance to the Northern markets from many of the points on these lines is much greater than the distance from Knoxo, which lies near the center of the so-called blanket territory.\n The Swift Lumber Company instituted proceedings before the Commission against the Illinois Central, the Fernwood & Gulf, and connecting carriers in which it attacked the higher rates from Knoxo both as unreasonable, under section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp. St.  8563), and as unjustly discriminatory, under section 3 (Comp. St.  8565). The Commission found that the rates from Knoxo were not unreasonable, but that they subject the Lumber Company to undue prejudice, in view of the lower rates so given competing points within the so-called blanket territory. The order directed the carriers 'according as they participate in the transportation ... to cease and desist' from the discrimination found. All the carriers except the Illinois Central and the Fernwood & Gulf acquiesced in the order. \n\n[263 U.S. 515, 520]\n\u00a0\n These two joined as plaintiffs in this suit, and urge on several grounds that the order is void.\n First. It is contended that the order exceeds the powers of the Commission. The argument is that a carrier cannot be held to have participated in an unjust discrimination unless it is a party both to the rate by which a preference has been given to others and to the higher rate which is given to the complainant; that the Fernwood & Gulf did not participate in the discrimination complained of, since it did not join in the lower rates from other points by which the Swift Lumber Company claims to be prejudiced, and hence that it cannot be required to co-operate with the Illinois Central in reducing rates from Knoxo which have been found to be inherently reasonable; that, on the other hand, the Illinois Central cannot be held to have subjected the Swift Lumber Company to undue prejudice, since Knoxo is not on its own lines, and it is not in a position to remove, by its own act, the discrimination complained of. Neither proposition is sound. Proceedings to remove unjust discrimination are aimed directly only at the relation of rates. By joining with the Illinois Central in establishing the prejudicial through rate from Knoxo, the Fernwood & Gulf became as much a party to the discrimination practiced as if it had joined also in the lower rates to other points which are alleged to be unduly preferential. Compare St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136, 144\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 49. If such were not the law, relief on the ground of discrimination could never be had against preferential rates given by a great railway system to points on its own lines which result in undue prejudice to shippers on short lines connecting with it. \n2\n Moreover, it is not true that the Illinois Central can \n\n[263 U.S. 515, 521]\n\u00a0\n not remove the discrimination without the co-operation of the Fernwood & Gulf. The order leaves the carriers free to remove the discrimination either by making the Knoxo rate as low as that from Fernwood, or by raising the rate from Fernwood, or by giving both an intermediate rate. American Express Co. v. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 624\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 656. The Illinois Central, acting alone, is in a position to raise the rate from Fernwood. For its main line extends from there to the Ohio River crossings, the rate-breaking point. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Second. It is contended that the order of the Commission is unsustained by proof. That there is discrimination against Knoxo is not denied. The rates charged from that station are higher than those charged from competing points within the so-called blanket territory for transportation of the same commodity, to the same market, for the same or longer distances, mainly over the same route; some of these competing points being located on the Illinois Central main line, some on its branch lines, and some on independent lines. But mere discrimination does not render a rate illegal under section 3. Only such rates as involve unjust discrimination are obnoxious to that section. Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 481\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 383. There is no claim that any one of the evidential facts found by the Commission, and relied upon to show \n\n[263 U.S. 515, 522]\n\u00a0\n that the discrimination was unjust, is without adequate supporting evidence. The argument is that these facts, even when supplemented by others appearing in the evidence, do not warrant the finding of the ultimate fact, that the higher rates from Knoxo are unduly prejudicial to the Swift Lumber Company to the extent that they exceed the blanket basis of rates from Fernwood (the junction with the Illinois Central) and other points.\n A carrier is entitled to initiate rates and, in this connection, to adopt such policy of rate-making as to it seems wise. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago Great Western Ry., \n209 U.S. 108\n, 118-119, 28 Sup. Ct. 493; Southern Pacific Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 U.S. 433\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 288; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 92\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 185. In the exercise of this right, the Illinois Central adopted the policy of establishing blanket, or group, rates on its main and branch lines, by which the remoter lumber producing points were granted, regardless of distances within the territory, the same rates to Northern markets as points located nearer. In the exercise of the same right to initiate rates, the Illinois Central adopted, also, the policy of granting to connecting independent short lines, and to longer connecting carriers, an allowance (called shrinkage or absorption) by reason of which the Illinois Central's division of the through rate on traffic originating on connections is reduced, by the amount of the allowance, to less than its rate for freight originating on its own line at the junction point. \n4\n The Illinois Central insists that its general policy is not to grant to points on connecting lines the blanket or junction point rate; and that it departs from this policy only when it is compelled by competition to do so. Where the through rate is the \n\n[263 U.S. 515, 523]\n\u00a0\n same from points on the connecting line as it is from the junction, the share or division of the connecting carrier consists wholly of this absorption. Where the through rate from points on the connection is higher than the junction point rate, the connecting line receives as its share an additional amount consisting of the difference between these rates. This additional amount is called the arbitrary or differential. Thus, the Fernwood & Gulf receives a division of 4 cents per 100 pounds, consisting of a 2-cent absorption and a 2-cent arbitrary. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Illinois Central argues that the discrimination in charging a higher rate from Knoxo cannot be deemed unjust since the preferential rate to other points was granted solely for the purpose of increasing its own business, and that the lower rate from Knoxo was denied solely in order to preserve its own revenues. In other words, it granted the blanket rate to all points on its own lines in order to develope business originating thereon. It declined to grant the blanket rate (and to increase the absorption) where the connecting line was wholly dependent upon it; and traffic originating thereon could be secured in spite of the higher rate. It granted the blanket rate to points on connection lines (and increased their absorptions) where this was deemed necessary in order to secure traffic which might otherwise go to competitors.\n The effort of a carrier to obtain more business, and to retain that which it had secured, proceeds from the motive of self-interest which is recognized as legitimate; and the fact that preferential rates were given only for this purpose relieves the carrier from any charge of \n\n[263 U.S. 515, 524]\n\u00a0\n favoritism or malice. But preferences may inflict undue prejudice, though the carrier's motives in granting them are honest. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago Great Western Ry., \n209 \nU.S. 108, 122\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 493. Self-interest of the carrier may not override the requirement of equality in rates. It is true that the law does not attempt to equalize opportunities among localities, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 \nU.S. 42, 46\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 22, and that the advantage which comes to a shipper merely as a result of the position of his plant does not constitute an illegal preference, Ellis v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n237 \nU.S. 434, 445\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 645. To bring a difference in rates within the prohibition of section 3, it must be shown that the discrimination practiced is unjust when measured by the transportation standard. In other words, the difference in rates cannot be held illegal, unless it is shown that it is not justified by the cost of the respective services, by their values, or by other transportation conditions. But the mere fact that the Knoxo rate is inherently reasonable, and that the rate from competing points is not shown to be unreasonably low, does not establish that the discrimination is just. Both rates may lie within the zone of reasonableness and yet result in undue prejudice. American Express Co. v. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 624\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 656\n\n\n Every factor urged by the carriers as justifying the higher rate from Knoxo appears to have been considered by the Commission. How much weight shall be given to each must necessarily be left to it. The Commission found, among other things, that the cost of the service from Knoxo was not greater than the cost of the transportation from many other points which enjoyed the lower rate; that the value of the service was the same; and that other traffic conditions incident to shipment from Knoxo were so similar to those of shipments from other points enjoying a lower rate that the prejudice to which \n\n[263 U.S. 515, 525]\n\u00a0\n the Swift Lumber Company had been subjected was undue and unreasonable. The innocent character of the discrimination practiced by the Illinois Central was not established, as a matter of law, by showing that the preferential rate was given to others for the purpose of devoloping traffic on the carrier's own lines or of securing competitive traffic. These were factors to be considered by the Commission; but they did not preclude a finding that the discrimination practiced is unjust. Such was the law even before Transportation Act 1920 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 et. seq.). Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 197, 218\n, 220 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 666; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Alabama Midland Ry., \n168 \nU.S. 144, 167\n, 175 S., 18 Sup. Ct. 45. In view of the policy and provisions of that statute, the Commission may properly have concluded that the carrier's desire to originate traffic on its own lines, or to take traffic from a competitor, should not be given as much weight in determining the justness of a discrimination against a locality as theretofore; for now the interests of the individual carrier must yield in many respects to the public need, Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 U.S. 563\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; New England Divisions Case, \n261 U.S. 184\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 270; and the newly conferred power to grant relief against rates unreasonably low many afford protection against injurious rate policies of a competitor, which were theretofore uncontrollable. The order of the Commission was not an attempt to establish its own policy of rate making. \n6\n See Southern Pacific Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 U.S. 433\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 288; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 554\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 108. It merely expressed the judgment of the Commission that existing rates subjected shippers from Knoxo \n\n[263 U.S. 515, 526]\n\u00a0\n to undue prejudice. The judgment so exercised, being supported by ample evldence, is conclusive. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Third. The Fernwood & Gulf contends that the order is obnoxious to the due process clause. The argument is that even its present division of 4 cents per 100 pounds is unremunerative, and that a smaller return would be confiscatory. To this argument there are several answers. The order does not require a reduction of the through rate. It may be complied with by raising the rate from Fernwood and other points now being preferred. Moreover, a reduction of the through rate would not necessarily result in decreasing the amount of the short line's division. The Commission may, upon application, accord to the Fernwood & Gulf the appropriate division. \n8\n The New England Divisions Case, \n261 U.S. 184\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 270. There is no suggestion that the resulting reduction of the Illinois Central's division would result in rendering the rate confiscatory as to it. \n\n[263 U.S. 515, 527]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. The Fernwood & Gulf contends, also, that the Swift Lumber Company is estopped from questioning the rates applicable to it. The argument is that when it acquired the mill property from a predecessor of the short line, an agreement provided that all lumber produced should be shipped over the line, and that the 2-cent arbitrary was then known to be in effect, and was thereby assented to for all time. The contract, which is silent as to rates, is not susceptible of the construction urged. We have, therefore, no occasion to consider whether such an agreement would be valid and what its effect would be. Compare Southern Pacific Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 U.S. 433\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 288; United States v. Union Stock Yard, \n226 U.S. 286\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 83; O'Keefe v. United States, \n240 U.S. 294\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 313.\n In No. 38, where the short line alone seeks to set aside the Commission's order, this additional fact requires mention. The rate to the short line points is not a joint rate, but a combination of the trunk line rate to the junction and the short line local rate. The distinction is without legal significance in this connection. A through route was established; and the transportation is performed as the result of this arrangement between the carriers, express or implied. \n9\n Undue prejudice may be inflicted as effectively by a through rate which is a combination of locals, as by a joint through rate. The power of the Commission to remove the unjust discrimination exists in both classes of cases.\n In No. 40, decree reversed.\n In No. 38, decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 U.S. 136\n, 138, note 1, 38 Sup. Ct. 49. The carriers insist that the rates are not properly called 'blanket rates,' since they do not apply to all points within the territory, and that they should be termed 'group rates.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The cases relied upon by the carriers are not inconsistent with this conclusion. In Central R. R. Co. of New Jersey v. United States, \n257 U.S. 247\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 80, the creosoting privilege was not a part of the joint tariff. It was an item in the local tariff granted without the concurrence of the carriers before the Commission; and the revenues derived therefrom were not shared by them. In Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 334, 340\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 354, it was pointed out by the court that 'undue discrimination against itself or the locality of its plant, as alleged by the cement company [the petitioner before the Commission] was not found; the community declared to be prejudiced by established conditions [Jersey City] had offered no complaint and was not party to the proceedings. In Penn Refining Co. v. Western New York and Pennsylvania R. R. Co., \n208 \nU.S. 208, 221\n, 222 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 268, it was sought to hold one of the connecting carriers liable for what the court deemed to be the act of another. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 U.S. 136\n, 139 , note 2, 38 Sup. Ct. 49. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See the Tap Line Cases, \n234 U.S. 1\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 741; Louisiana & Pine Bluff Ry. Co. v. United States, \n257 U.S. 114\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 25. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] As a division of only 2 cents is ordinarily deemed inadequate compensation by a connecting line, and as the trunk line is naturally indisposed to submit to a larger shrinkage of its own division, the through rate is commonly increased by an arbitrary if the traffic will bear it. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Compare Idaho v.

Ewing, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 236, 238]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 236, 239]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit against the United States to recover the amount of the difference between the pay of a captain and a rear admiral in the navy, based upon section 11 of the Navy Personnel Act of March 3, 1899, c. 413, 30 Stat. 1004, 1007 (Comp. St.  2641), as follows:\n'That any officer of the navy, with a creditable record, who served during the civil war, \n\n[266 U.S. 236, 240]\n\u00a0\n shall, when retired, be retired with the rank and three-fourths the sea pay of the next higher grade.'\n\n Claimant, having served forty years from the date of his entrance into the Naval Academy, was retired under section 1443, R. S. (Comp. St.  2620), which reads:\n'When any officer of the navy has been forty years in the service of the United States he may be retired from active service by the President upon his own application.'\n\n The right of the officer turns upon the question whether his service at the Naval Academy constitutes 'service during the civil war,' within the meaning of the provision first above quoted. Three previous suits for installments of salary-the right of recovery in each depending upon this same basic question-were decided by the Court of Claims in his favor. In each, the contention of the government was the same as it is here, viz. that service as a cadet during the civil war was not service within the meaning of the statute. Between the first and second of these suits, in another suit brought by a different claimant, the court construed the statute otherwise and denied that claimant a right of recovery (Jasper v. United States, 43 Ct. Cl. 368); the change of opinion being made to rest upon a later act, then for the first time called to the court's attention, which, in terms, excluded the period of service as a cadet, but with a proviso that it should not apply to an officer who had received an advance of grade at or since the date of his retirement (chapter 3590, 34 Stat. 553, 554).\n In the second and third Moser Cases, however, the Court of Claims declined to follow the Jasper Case, holding that, by reason of its decision in the first Moser Case, the question was res judicata. The present suit was decided in Moser's favor upon the same ground; and, in addition, the court reverted to the position taken in the first Moser Case, abandoning, as unsound, its view as expressed \n\n[266 U.S. 236, 241]\n\u00a0\n in the Jasper Case, upon the ground that the right of the officer was saved by the proviso.\n We find it unnecessary to consider the latter ruling, since we are of opinion that the court was clearly right in its application of the doctrine of res judicata.\n The general principles are well settled, and need not be discussed. The scope of their application depends upon whether the question arises in a subsequent action between the same parties upon the same claim or demand or upon a different claim or demand. In the former case a judgment upon the merits constitutes an absolute bar to the subsequent action. In the latter case the inquiry is whether the point or question presented for determination in the subsequent action is the same as that litigated and determined in the original action. Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 \nU.S. 351, 352\n, 353 S.. The rule is succinctly stated in Southern Pacific R. R. Co. v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 1, 48\n, 18 S. Ct. 18, 27 (42 L. Ed. 355):\n'The general principle announced in numerous cases is that a right, question or fact distinctly put in issue and directly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, as a ground of recovery, cannot be disputed in a subsequent suit between the same parties or their privies; and even if the second suit is for a different cause of action, the right, question or fact once so determined must, as between the same parties or their privies, be taken as conclusively established, so long as the judgment in the first suit remains unmodified.'\n\n And in New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 \nU.S. 371, 396\n, 17 S. Ct. 905, 913 (42 L. Ed. 202) this court, speaking through Mr. Justice White, said:\n'The estoppel resulting from the thing adjudged does not depend upon whether there is the same demand in both cases, but exists, even although there be different demands, when the question upon which the recovery of the second demand depends has under identical circumstances and conditions been previously concluded by a \n\n[266 U.S. 236, 242]\n\u00a0\n judgment between the parties or their privies.'\n\n And see Myers v. International Co., \n263 \nU.S. 64\n, 44 S. Ct. 86.\n The suits here are upon different demands; and the point at issue is to be determined by applying the second branch of the rule. The question expressly and definitely presented in this suit is the same as that definitely and actually litigated and adjudged in favor of the claimant in the three preceding suits, viz. whether he occupied the status of an officer who had served during the Civil War.\n The contention of the government seems to be that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to questions of law; and, in a sense, that is true. It does not apply to unmixed questions of law. Where, for example, a court in deciding a case has enunciated a rule of law, the parties in a subsequent action upon a different demand are not estopped from insisting that the law is otherwise, merely because the parties are the same in both cases. But a fact, question or right distinctly adjudged in the original action cannot be disputed in a subsequent action, even though the determination was reached upon an erroneous view or by an erroneous application of the law. That would be to affirm the principle in respect of the thing adjudged but, at the same time, deny it all efficacy by sustaining a challenge to the grounds upon which the judgment was based.

NEW RIVER CO(1924)\nNo. 627\nArgued: April 24, 1924Decided: June 9, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 533, 534]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C., for the United states.\n Mr. J. Carter Fort, of Washington, D. C., for appellant Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. G. T. Bell, of Washington, D. C., for appellants Slab Fork Coal Co. and others.\n Mr. James W. Carmalt, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the appellees against the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company and the Virginian Railway Company, competing interstate carriers by railroad, the United States, and the Interstate Commerce Commission to enjoin the carriers from applying a certain rule (rule 4 of Circular CS-31, Revised) for the distribution of coal cars and to set aside the decision and order of the Commission of December 11, 1922, in certain proceedings instituted by the appellees against the defendant carriers.\n For convenience, a mine served by one carrier is called a 'local mine,' and a mine served by two or more carriers a 'joint mine.' Each appellee is the operator of a joint mine served by the defendant carriers, and each appellant mining company is the operator of a local mine \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 535]\n\u00a0\n served by one or the other of the carriers. The car service rules were promulgated to govern uniformly the 'ratings' of coal mines, other than anthracite, and car distribution to such mines during periods of car shortage. The daily rating of a local mine for any month is based on its tonnage shipped during the preceding month, and is identical with its daily capacity to produce coal. The rating of a joint mine is calculated in the same way that the daily rating of a local mine is determined, except that its shipments over all carriers serving it are considered in determining its total capacity to produce coal. The figure so ascertained is called the 'gross daily rating,' in recognition of the fact that the rating of a joint mine does not represent its capacity to ship over each carrier on days when it uses more than one, but, on the contrary, represents its total daily capacity to ship over all lines which serve it. Rule 4 provides:\n'Copies of orders for cars for a mine that is joint with any other carrier (steam, electric, or water) shall be filed with a designated representative of each such carrier. Such combinations must not exceed the gross daily rating of the mine.'\n\n Under the rules, when a mine orders less than its rating, distribution to it is on the basis of its orders.\n These rules were established during the period of federal control of the railroads. After the expiration of that period, the Commission issued a notice, dated March 2, 1920, recommending to carriers and shippers that the rules be continued in effect until experience and further study demonstrated that others would be more effective and beneficial. They were continued by carriers generally. July 8, 1920, the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company and the Virginian Railway Company asked for permission to discontinue rule 4 and to substitute for it the '150 per cent. rule,' which the Commission in 1912 had found to be a reasonable rule for the Illinois Central Railroad Company (In re Irregularities in Mine Ratings, 25 \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 536]\n\u00a0\n Interst. Com. Com'n R. 286, 295), but which had never been followed by he railroads generally or by the defendant carriers. Under this rule, a joint mine may order 100 per cent. of its gross daily rating from either carrier serving it, and is entitled to receive its pro rata share of that carrier's available cars. If it so orders, it is not entitled to any cars from the other carrier. In this respect, it does not differ from rule 4. However, if a joint mine served by two carriers orders cars from both on the same day, it is entitled to order from each carrier 75 per cent. of its gross daily rating, making its combined orders 150 per cent., but subject to the limitation that it is not entitled to receive in the aggregate more than its gross daily rating. The Commission declined to give permission to substitute the 150 per cent. rule for rule 4.\n January 11, 1921, appellees filed separate complaints with the Commission against the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company and against the Virginian Railway Company, attacking rule 4 as unjust and unreasonable and unduly prejudicial to joint mines and unduly preferential of local mines. Certain operators of joint mines intervened in support of the complaints. Certain operators of local mines intervened in support of rule 4. The complaints were consolidated with each other and with similar complaints. June 21, 1921, division 5 of the Commission reported as follows:\n'... We find that rule 4 of Circular CS-31, Revised, is unreasonable and unduly prejudicial to joint mines and unduly preferential of local mines, to the extent that it limits the aggregate orders of the joint mine to 100 per cent. of its rating from both roads; and that for the future during periods of car shortage defendants should distribute cars to the joint mines on their lines here considered on the basis outlined in the Illinois Case [In re Irregularities in Mine Ratings, supra]. ...' Fairmont & Cleveland Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 62 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 269, 276.\n\n The Commission \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 537]\n\u00a0\n referred to its authority, under section 1(13) of the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563), by general or special orders to require carriers by railroad to file their rules and regulations with respect to car service, and to direct that such rules and regulations be incorporated in the schedule showing rates, fares and charges for transportation, and be subject to the provisions of the act relating thereto, and added:\n'We have not required that car service rules be filed as tariff schedules. We will not in this proceeding direct that the rules which we herein find to be reasonable be so filed. We shall expect, however, that defendants will promptly amend their car service rules so as to conform with our findings and evidence same by filing copies thereof with us.'\n\n No formal order was entered, but the defendant carriers amended their rules to conform to the findings in the report, and put in force and applied the 150 per cent. rule.\n Subsequently, on petition of the intervening operators of the local mines, the case was reopened and considered by the full Commission. December 11, 1922, it reversed the findings of division 5 and found that rule 4 was not unreasonable or unduly prejudicial. Bell & Zoller Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern R. R. Co., 74 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 433. It said:\n'Our former conclusions in the Fairmont Cases, based upon a mistaken adherence to and extension of the decision in the Illinois Case, are reversed.'\n\n The Commission made a formal order, reciting that it had--\n'made and filed a report containing its findings of fact and conclusions thereon, which said report is hereby referred to and made a part hereof. It is ordered that the complaints in these proceedings be, and they are hereby, dismissed.'\n\n Following the report and order, the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company and the Virginian Railway Company gave notice to the appellees that they would put rule 4 in effect again. \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 538]\n\u00a0\n Thereupon this suit was brought. The complaint alleged that the carriers put the rule in effect because of the order of the Commission, and in fear of the penalties imposed by law for violation of its orders. It attacked the order and rule on the ground that they are beyond the power which the Commission can constitutionally exercise, and are in excess of the power conferred upon it by statute, and that they are arbitrary and unreasonable. The Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company answered that the effect of the order upon it was necessarily the same as though the order had been in affirmative form, requiring it to cease and desist publishing and observing the Illinois rule (150 per cent. rule) and in lieu thereof to publish and observe rule 4, and that, facing the danger of suits for heavy damages, supported by a decision and reparation orders which it believed would follow its failure to observe the rule prescribed by the Commission, it undertook to cancel the existing rule and to restore rule 4. The Virginian Railway Company answered that in the matter of distribution of cars, it was subject to the orders of the Commission, and that the Commission having decided that rule 4 is not unreasonable or unduly prejudicial, and, in the same decision having expressly reversed its conclusion in the Fairmont Case, that company considered itself legally bound to put rule 4 in effect on its railroad. The United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission moved to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction and want of equity. The interveners moved to dismiss and later answered.\n The case was presented to and heard by a court of three judges. Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 220 (Comp. St.  998). The operation of the order of the Commission was stayed and suspended. After trial, final decree was entered setting aside the Commission's order and rule 4 and enjoining the United States, the Commission and the defendant carriers from restricting the rights of appellees in accordance \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 539]\n\u00a0\n with the order and rule, or through any other order or rule to the same effect. 293 Fed. 460. The United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission appealed. No. 627. The interveners appealed. No. 628. The carriers did not appeal.\n The questions for decision are: Whether the order was subject to review by the District Court; and, if so, whether it should be set aside.\n\n 1. \nThe District Courts have jurisdiction over 'cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.' Act June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539; Judicial Code,  207, Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1148; Act Oct. 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 219. The appellants contend the order is negative, and therefore not subject to review by the court. They cite Procter & Gamble v. United States, \n225 U.S. 282\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 761, Hooker v. Knapp, \n225 U.S. 302\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 769, and Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, \n243 U.S. 412\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 397. In the first of these cases, application was made by the Procter & Gamble Company, a shipper and owner of tank cars, to be relieved from paying demurrage charges, in accordance with demurrage rules applied by the carrier. The Commission dismissed the complaint. As shown by the report (19 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 556, 560), the reason for dismissal was that the tank cars were made subject to the demurrage rules, by an arrangement between the shipper owning the cars and the carrier hauling them. The question before this court (page 292) was whether the Commerce Court had power to exert its own judgment by originally interpreting the administrative features of the Act to Regulate Commerce, and upon that assumption to treat the refusal of the Commission to grant the relief prayed for as an affirmative order, and accordingly to pass on its correctness. Hooker v. Knapp and Lehigh Valley Railroad Co. v. United States were decided on the authority of the Procter & Gamble Case. \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 540]\n\u00a0\n The opinion in that case, when viewed in the light of the report of the Commission, furnishes no support for appellants' contentions here. In all of these cases, affirmative relief sought was denied by the Commission. Judicial review was refused on that ground. The taking of jurisdiction in such cases would involve determination by the courts whether relief denied by the Commission, in the exercise of its powers, should be granted. See The Chicago Junction Case, \n264 U.S. 258\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 317, 68 L. Ed. --. The authority conferred upon the Commerce Court by section 207 of the Judicial Code was vested in the District Courts by the Act of October 22, 1913, and, like the authority previously exercised by the federal Circuit Courts, is confined to determining whether the Commission's order violates the Constitution, or exceeds the power delegated by statute, or is an exercise of power so arbitrary as virtually to transcend the authority conferred.

Ct. 383. See also Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. R., \n215 \nU.S. 452, 470\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 155; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R.

Sup. Ct. 375.\n The mere fact that the order of the Commission dismisses the complaint of shippers against rule 4 does not make it a negative order. That rule, promulgated during federal control, was continued in effect upn the recommendation of the Commission until it decided, June 21, 1921, that the rule was unduly prejudicial to joint mines and unduly preferential of local mines, and that the carriers should distribute cars to joint mines on the basis of the 150 per cent. rule. The Commission refrained from making an order that the rule be filed as a tariff schedule, but announced that it expected the carriers \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 541]\n\u00a0\n promptly to amend their car service rules to conform with its findings. Accordingly, the carrier ceased to apply rule 4 and applied the 150 per cent. rule in its place. When the case was reopened before the Commission, the contest was between the operators of local mines attacking the 150 per cent. rule and the operators of joint mines supporting that rule and objecting to rule 4. The Commission reversed its former findings and decided in favor of rule 4 and dismissed the complaints assailing that rule. The order expressly includes the findings and conclusions stated in the report. It is not merely negative. Clearly, the order permits and authorizes the carriers to apply rule 4. If that rule is illegal, as alleged, such permission and authority will not sustain it, and suit will lie to set it aside. The Chicago Junction Case, supra. Plainly, it was the intention and purpose of the Commission that rule 4 should be applied in place of the 150 per cent. rule. The effect of the order is to grant the relief sought by the operators of local mines. We hold that the District Court had jurisdiction.\n\n 2. \nAppellees contend that each operator of a joint mine has a legal right to its fair share of the car supply of each carrier serving the mine; that the operator on any day may offer the prospective output of the mine to any carrier serving it, and is entitled on that basis to its share of the carrier's available cars; and that, if any portion of the output remains, the operator may offer it to the second carrier, and is entitled to a fair share of that carrier's available cars. This practice is forbidden by rule 4, approved by the order of the Commission. The court below held the order invalid, as discriminatory, in that it deprived the operator of a joint mine of an advantage to which it has a legal right.\n The Interstate Commerce Act confers power on the Commission to regulate the distribution of cars. See section 1, (3), (4), (6), (10), (11 ), (12), (14); section 3(1); section 15(1) being Comp. St.  8563, 8565, 8583. \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 542]\n\u00a0\n And its jurisdiction over the subject is exclusive. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. R., supra, 472 (30 Sup. Ct. 155); Baltimore & Ohio R. R. v. United States ex rel. Pitcairn Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 481, 493\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 164; Morrisdale Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 304, 313\n, 33 S.

Illinois Central R. R., supra, 470 (30 Sup. Ct. 155); Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R., supra, 547 (32 Sup. Ct. 108); Kansas City Southern Railway v. United States, supra, 456 (34 Sup. Ct. 125; United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n235 \nU.S. 314, 320\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 113; Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, supra, 488 (38 Sup. Ct. 383).\n Under rule 4, an operator of a local mine is entitled on the basis of its daily rating to its pro rata share of the available cars of the carrier serving it. An operator of a joint mine is not confined to any one carrier serving it. It may order from each carrier, but the total number of cars ordered may not exceed the gross daily rating of the mine. It may select the carrier which at the time has the better car supply and receive its pro rata share of that supply according to its gross daily rating, based on its capacity to ship by all carriers. It may choose between the carriers to secure the service, connections and markets it desires to have. The determination of the Commission in favor of rule 4 cannot be said to be so arbitrary or unreasonable as to transcend the power conferred upon it in respect of car distribution. The contention that the order of the Commission deprives operators of joint mines of their property without due process of law is without merit.\n Decree reversed. \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 543]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA (dissenting).\n Let me state the proposition of the opinion denuded of the confusion of its words. It is that the owner of property, a 'joint mine' (to use the designation of the case) having available to him the car facilities of two carriers, must yield his advantage or some of it to the owner of a 'local mine' (to use the designation of the case) who is not so situated.\n I am unable to assent and yet I hesitate to dissent. Certainly hesitate to do so by unsupported declaration. I am, however, puzzled to go beyond declaration. Exposition seems to be that of demonstrating the certainty and self-evidence of an axiom. The doctrine of the opinion is that the Interstate Commerce Commission, and this Court in sustaining it, can take from property an attribute, almost as tangible an attribute as its physical substance-that is, its position, that which avails and makes wealth of its products. This, in my opinion, is a deprivation of property. I repeat, to have it intimately in our attention and estimation, that the doctrine of the opinion is that the owner of a 'joint mine' may not avail of the cars accessible to his situation-cars of two carriers-only in a degree; he must yield in other degree, the full advantage of his position to the owner of a 'local mine' that the latter may have accommodation. And why? Is it the dictate of public interest, and if public interest may so dictate, may it not dictate other constituents and conditions of property? Whatever contributes to its value and is formidable to a competitor?\n Position of property is as much a constituent of its value as its composition. A market for its products is as necessary as its products. There must be demand for the products and means of their supply, and both, I repeat, are attributes of property. Indeed, they constitute its value aside from its utility. Take them away or limit \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 544]\n\u00a0\n them and you take away or limit its value-its right and exercise-its existence.\n Property has adversaries in this world and different forms excite different degrees of antagonism, but we have not yet attained to that subserviency of regulation that one owner of property must surrender the advantage of his position to every other owner, giving up what is of value to him, and what was of cost to him.\n And what is the justification-the interest of the public? Is it an exercise of eminent domain? Under the fundamental law it is a condition of the exercise of eminent domain that it recompense the detriment it causes or the property it takes. This would seem so elementary as to require no exposition. If one property owner may be required to share his means of reaching markets with another property owner, why not the markets; and having customers of a definite portion of the alphabet, be required to remand the rest of it to other property owners?\n One residing in this town should need no illustration of the advantage of position. One cannot step out on the streets without having thrust upon him the evidence of the eager push of business to advantageous positions, recognizing their value and payig with eager competition the increase of price.\n According to the doctrine of the opinion, the inducement does not exist in a coal mine, but whatever advantage of instrumentalities it has it must share in the public interest with a competitor. If so, why not all instrumentalities-those it owns as well as those that by its position it is able to obtain.\n Nor is the proposition of the opinion justified because it is the disposition of an instrumentality of a public service corporation. I repeat that an owner of property is entitled in the exercise of his rights and satisfaction of his needs to demand service of the carriers to which he \n\n[265 U.S. 533, 545]\n\u00a0\n has relation according to his rights and needs, and in the order of their requisition, and the ability of the carrier.\n I concur in the reasoning of Commissioner Potter:\n'We may not restrict the use of transportation facilities in order to equalize mine operation. To do so would be to require discrimination in the use of equipment-not remove it. If a local mine is at a disadvantage it is not because of a transportation problem with which we may deal. ...'\n\n The question in the case is made obscure by an attempt at its simplification. It seems the prompt assurance of self-evidence that a mine owner with the facilities of two railroads may order such number of cars from both railroads as he may need, this being a right relative to his property, indisputably an element of its value, represented in its price and the cost to him.\n I think, therefore, the decree should be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

St.  8820 et seq.), and of its supplementary Act of August 27, 1894, c. 349, 28 Stat. 570, as amended by Act Feb. 12, 1913, c. 40, 37 Stat. 667 (Comp. St.  8831, 8834 ). The proceeding was brought under the expediting provisions of the Act of February 11, 1903, c. 544, 32 Stat. 823, as amended by Act June 25, 1910, c. 428, 36 Stat. 854 (Comp. St.  8824). The Attorney General having duly filed a certificate that the case was of general public importance, notice of a motion for an interlocutory injunction was given by the petitioner. The corporate defendants filed an answer which by stipulation was made the answer of the individual defendants. By further stipulation the cause was submitted to final hearing before three Circuit Judges upon petition and answer and the affidavits which had been presented by both sides on the motion for a preliminary injunction. The petition was dismissed, and this is an appeal under section 2, c. 544, of the Act of February 11, 1903, 32 Stat. 823 (Comp. St.  8825). \n\n[263 U.S. 611, 616]\n\u00a0\n The sugar market of the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange was not organized until the great war in 1914, when foreign sugar exchanges ceased to function. It was intended to afford a world exchange for the purchase and sale of sugar. It continued as an exchange until this country engaged in the war, when it was closed by government direction. Upon the coming of peace, it opened again and has been in operation ever since. The dealings are chiefly in raw sugars. The contracts made are for future delivery. There are no 'wash' sales; i. e., merely bets upon the market in which it is understood between the parties that neither is bound to deliver or accept delivery. But it is true that the sugar is not delivered except in a very small percentage of the contracts. The contracts are settled by offsetting purchases against sales; i. e., by 'matching,' as it is called, or by 'ringing.' This is the same general method of settlement as that which prevails in grain sales for future delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade, and is described by this court in Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., \n198 U.S. 236\n, 247, et seq., 25 Sup. Ct. 637. The Sugar Clearing Association, codefendant herein with the Exchange, though a separate corporation, is under the same general management as the Exchange and its function is to provide a clearing house in which such ringing settlements are made. About 75 per cent. of the transactions are thus cleared. Nearly all the rest are 'matched' and only a tenth to a quarter of 1 per cent. of the contracts are settled by actual delivery under the rules of the Exchange. The prices at which raw sugar is sold elsewhere for immediate delivery-i. e., of 'spot' sales-vary very much as the prices for future delivery vary on the Exchange. It is clear that the prices for futures have a direct relation to, and effect upon, the prices in 'spot' sales. The prices of raw sugar that prevail in the Exchange are used as a basis for the prices of sugar in the markets of the world. \n\n[263 U.S. 611, 617]\n\u00a0\n Cuba is the largest single source of raw sugar for the United States and its crop equals or exceeds the supply from all other sources, domestic or foreign. The petition charges that the Exchange and the Clearing Association are machinery for the promotion of gambling; that, though its contracts for futures on their face are for actual delivery, they really are not intended or expected by either party to result in delivery; that the Exchange rules discourage delivery; that, when in fact actual delivery is sought, purchases are not made on the Exchange, but elsewhere; that the Exchange thus puts in the hands of gamblers the means of influencing directly the prices of sugar to be delivered, and thereby of obstructing and restraining its free flow in trade between Cuba and the United States and between the states.\n The occasion for the suit was a violent fluctuation in the price of sugar futures and as a consequence in the price of spot sugars during February, March, and April of 1923. The petition alleges that during this period there was no economic justification for such a sudden and excessive increase, but that notwithstanding raw sugar at New York, May delivery, increased $3.65 to $4.07 per cwt. between February 1st and February 8th, and thereafter gradually increased from day to day until April 16th when the peak of $5.97 per cwt. was reached. The effect upon refined sugar used by the consuming public was to increase its price for immediate delivery in New York from $6.70 per cwt. in February to $9.30 per cwt. in March and April.\n The petition charges that all this was 'the direct result of a combination and conspiracy between the Sugar Exchange and the Clearing Association and the officers and members of those corporations and their clients or principals who by means of purported purchases and \n\n[263 U.S. 611, 618]\n\u00a0\n sales of sugar, have sought to establish and have established artificial and unwarranted prices, not governed by the law of supply and demand, but based wholly on speculative dealings not involving the delivery of the quantities of sugar represented thereby, but altogether carried on for the purpose and with the effect of unduly enhancing the price of sugar to the enrichment of said defendants and their principals and to the detriment of the public.'\n The prayer is that the court adjudge that the by-laws, rules, and regulations of the defendant corporations in so far as they relate to sugar and the concerted action of the individual defendants in carrying them out, show a combination and conspiracy in violation of federal anti- trust laws, and that the defendants and each of them be enjoined from maintaining and operating the Sugar Exchange and Clearing House, from publishing the prices of raw or refined sugar in Exchange transactions as purporting to be its market price, from attempting to establish it as such in bona fide dealing in actual sugar, and 'from entering into any transaction on such Exchange or elsewhere involving or purporting to involve the purchase, sale, or delivery of sugar unless the person purporting to make such sale has in his possession or under his control a supply of sugar adequate to meet the requirements of such transaction, and the person purporting to purchase shall in good faith intend to buy and pay for such sugar and accept delivery as soon as the same can be made.'\n The answer of the corporate defendants denied all charges of combination and conspiracy to increase prices or to obstruct or restrain the free flow of commerce in sugar, gave the history of the organization of the two corporations, and alleged that they served a very useful purpose in stabilizing the price of sugar by furnishing a free market for this country and the world. \n\n[263 U.S. 611, 619]\n\u00a0\n The evidence shows that the rules and organization of the Exchange and Clearing Association are very like those of the Chicago Board of Trade and similar exchanges for the sales of commodities for future delivery. It is true that spot sales are not encouraged and that less actual deliveries take place in this Exchange than in some of the exchanges for sales of other commodities, but actual deliveries are provided for in every contract and may be lawfully enforced by either party.\n The usefulness and legality of sales for future delivery, and of furnishing an Exchange where under well-defined limitations and rules the business can be carried on have been fully recognized by this court in Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., \n198 \nU.S. 236, 246\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 637. Those who have studied the economic effect of such exchanges for contracts for future deliveries generally agree that they stabilize prices in the long run instead of promoting their fluctuation. Those who deal in 'futures' are divided into three classes: First, those who use them to hedge, i. e., to insure themselves against loss by unfavorable changes in price at the time of actual delivery of what they have to sell or buy in their business; second, legitimate capitalists, who, exercising their judgment as to the conditions, purchase or sell for future delivery with a view to profit based on the law of supply and demand; and, third, gamblers or irresponsible speculators, who buy or sell as upon the turn of a card. The machinery or such an exchange has been at times made the means of promoting corners in the commodity dealt in by such manipulators and speculators, thereby restraining and obstructing foreign and interstate trade. In such instances, the manipulators subject themselves to prosecution and indictment under the Anti-Trust Act. United States v. Patten, \n226 U.S. 525\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 141, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 325. But this is not to hold that such an exchange, with the facilities it affords for making contracts for future deliveries, is itself a combination \n\n[263 U.S. 611, 620]\n\u00a0\n and conspiracy thus to restrain interstate and foreign trade.\n There is not the slightest evidence adduced to show that the two corporate defendants or any of their officers or members entered into a combination or conspiracy to raise the price of sugar. The circumstances upon which the government placed its case were a violent rise in the price of sugar without any economic justification or explanation lasting two months or more and manifesting itself first in 'futures' on the Exchange and afterwards in the price of refined sugar for immediate delivery. The defendants suggest that this was due to a popular misconstruction of the regular monthly report of the Department of Commerce as to a probable shortage in the supply of sugar during the year 1923, followed by a statement from a business house in Cuba, usually regarded as a reliable source of information, that the previous estimate of the amount of the next Cuban crop was too high by several hundred thousand tons. Whether these circumstances were sufficient to explain in full the violent rise in the price of sugar, we need not discuss. The government case fails because there is no evidence to establish that the defendants produced or attempted to produce the disturbance of the market.\n The mere fact that the defendants were operating the Sugar Exchange and Clearing Association, even if we concede that some persons, not identified, combining and conspiring with criminal intent used the Exchange and Clearing Association to cause the rise in sugar prices, concessions which there is no testimony to support, furnishes no reason for enjoining defendants from continuing the Exchange or for a mandatory injunction to reframe the rules of the Exchange and the Clearing Association.\n The government contends that the prayer of the petition is justified by the decision of this court in the case of Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, \n262 U.S. 1\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 470. It has \n\n[263 U.S. 611, 621]\n\u00a0\n no application. We held there that Congress having found that the sales of grain for future delivery on the Board of Trade were susceptible to speculation, manipulation and control affecting interstate consignments of grain in such a way as to cause a direct burden on, and interference with, interstate commerce therein, had power to place such markets under federal supervision to prevent such abuses. But nothing in the case sustains the view that those promoting and operating such an Exchange are themselves imposing a burden or restraint upon interstate commerce for which they may be indicted under the Anti-Trust Act, or from continuing which they may be enjoined. The government in effect asks this court to enforce rules and regulations for the conduct of the Sugar Exchange which shall prevent the future abuse of its lawful functions.

Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission. \n\n[266 U.S. 191, 192]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry Wolf Bikle, of Philadelphia, Pa., and F. D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 191, 195]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n York, Pa., is served by three railroads. About 100 manufacturing establishments are directly connected with them by spurs or industry sidings-most of the plants with only one of the three railroads. Where the plant is thus directly connected with the railroad which has the line haul, it makes no extra charge for switching the car \n\n[266 U.S. 191, 196]\n\u00a0\n between its road and the plant. Where the connection is not direct-that is, where in order to reach the plant the car must move for a short distance over the line of another carrier-all of the plants except 17 must pay an additional transportation charge. The more favored treatment accorded by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Western Maryland Railway to these 17 was held by the Interstate Commerce Commission to constitute unjust discrimination,1 and the customary order to remove the discrimination was made. Manufacturers' Assn. of York v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 73 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 40. The Western Maryland acquiesced in the order. The Pennsylvania brought this suit against the United States to enjoin its enforcement. The Commission intervened as defendant. The case was heard before three judges on motions to dismiss. The court, Judge Witmer dissenting, entered a final decree granting the relief prayed for. 295 F. 523. The case is here on direct appeal under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220.\n The 17 plants are located in a small section of the city in which lines of the Pennsylvania and of the Western Maryland run substantially parallel. About half of these plants have their spur connections with the Pennsylvania; the remainder have theirs with the Western Maryland. By an arrangement between these companies, each is permitted to, and does, pass over the road of the other with its own locomotives and attached cars in order to make deliveries to and accept shipments from plants located on spurs directly connected only with the road of the other carrier. Industries within the zone thus get the same advantage over those without it which would flow from an agreement for reciprocal free-switching or for absorption of the \n\n[266 U.S. 191, 197]\n\u00a0\n switching charges which was limited to their traffic. The Commission found that, 'from the standpoint of carriage, the situation of industries inside and outside the zone is substantially similar,' and that the described practice 'subjects shippers ... without the zone to undue prejudice and disadvantage.' \n2\n The only substantial question3 for decision is whether the advantage enjoyed by these 17 plants, although found, as a fact, to result in undue prejudice, must be held, as a matter of law, to be a lawful preference, because of the means by which the advantage is effected.\n The argument most strongly urged is this: In the absence of an appropriate order carriers are not obliged to extend or curtail their facilities; or to submit to enlarged use of their terminals. The arrangement by which the Pennsylvania and the Western Maryland extend, each to the other, the use of their tracks to effect terminal receipt and delivery of carload freight within the zone is a trackage agreement and is, in law, either a limited extension of the line of each carrier or an agreement for the limited common use by each carrier of terminal facilities of the \n\n[266 U.S. 191, 198]\n\u00a0\n other. To accord to plants without the zone the same service which, under the arrangement, is enjoyed by those within the zone would involve either a further extension of the tracks of each carrier or an enlargement of the common use of their terminal facilities. Under the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Transportation Act, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, the Commission might, upon proper findings and conditions, have ordered such extension of tracks, under the powers conferred by section 1, par. 21, p. 478 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563), or it might have ordered an enlargement of the common use of terminals under section 3, par. 4, p. 479 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8565); or it might have equalized rates and charges for plants within and without the zone by exercise of the power, conferred by section 15, pars. 3 and 4, pp. 485, 486 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8583 ), to establish through routes and joint rates. The grant of these specific powers indicates a purpose on the part of Congress to so restrict the Commission's general power to prevent unjust discrimination, prohibited by section 3, that a preference granted certain shippers served by a carrier by virtue of the ownership of tracks or trackage rights over other shippers not reached by the carrier, because it does not own tracks or trackage rights which would enable it to reach them, cannot warrant a finding of undue discrimination; and that similarly the withholding or possession of trackage rights between carriers cannot, in law, constitute undue preference. In support of this argument, attention is called to the fact that, as originally enacted,4 section 3, after prohibiting discrimination as between connecting carriers in respect to facilities for interchange of traffic, rates nad charges, provides: 'But this shall not be construed as requiring any such common carrier to give the use of its tracks or terminal facilities to another carrier engaged in like business.' 24 Stat. 380 (Comp. St.  8565). \n\n[266 U.S. 191, 199]\n\u00a0\n The argument is, in our opinion, unsound. There is nothing in the Act to Regulate Commerce, as originally enacted, or in Transportation Act 1920, or in any earlier amendment, which indicates a purpose on the part of Congress either to allow a carrier to create undue prejudice by the use of facilities possessed, or to narrow the Commission's powers to prevent unjust discrimination. The clause quoted was doubtless inserted in section 3 to make clear that the mere grant to one carrier of the use of tracks or terminal facilities for the purpose of interchanging traffic and the refusal of such facilities to another, does not make the preference given illegal. The clause had no other effect. In this respect, it resembles the provision contained in section 22 (Comp. St.  8595), concerning free service or reduced rates to the federal, state and municipal governments. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. v. Tennessee, \n262 \nU.S. 318\n, 43 S. Ct. 583.\n The Commission has found, not merely that the facilities in question were granted to some and refused to other, but that the grant and refusal have, by reason of the use made and intended to be made of the facilities, resulted in undue prejudice. It is true that an extension of trackage rights, an enlarged common use of terminals, or the establishment of through routes and joint rates, or the withdrawal of any of them, could not be ordered except upon the findings and conditions prescribed in the act. But the order complained of does not require any such thing. It requires only that the carriers shall desist from a practice which involves such use as has resulted and will result in the undue prejudice found. The order leaves them free to remove the discrimination by any appropriate action. American Express Co. v. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 624\n, 37 S. Ct. 656; United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 521\n, 44 S. Ct. 189. To accomplish this, it is not necessary that the Pennsylvania should grant to the other carriers the extensive use of the terminal facilities and tracks \n\n[266 U.S. 191, 200]\n\u00a0\n WHICH WAS SOUGHT,5 AND WHich the commission found was not SHOwn to be in the public interest. Compare Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 351, 368\n, 35 S. Ct. 370; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 35 S. Ct. 696. The situation in this case is unlike that which was presented in Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 60\n, 37 S. Ct. 61.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The fact that 2 of the 17 plants hereinafter referred to are connected by spurs with both roads may be ignored in this discussion. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The order declared that the 'Commission having found in said report that the practice of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Western Maryland Railway Company of extending the use of their tracks to each other for the purpose of terminal receipt and delivery of freight at industries in York within a zone described in the report, while refusing to extend the use of their tracks for the purpose of delivering or receiving freight at other industries similarly located but without the zone, under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, is subjecting various shippers and industries to undue prejudice: It is ordered that said defendants be ... required to cease and desist ... from practicing the undue prejudice. ...' \n[\nFootnote 3\n] There is a faint contention that the order is invalid, also, because it is not in terms limited to interstate commerce. That it should be construed as not applying to intrastate commerce is clear. Compare Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 204\n, 42 S.

M., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought by the United States in the Federal District Court for New Mexico to quiet title \n\n[264 U.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n to a large strip of land claimed as part of the public lands. The defendants claim title under the 'Mora Grant,' which was segregated from the public domain by a patent issued in 1876. The United States does not challenge the validity of the grant, and admits that the west boundary of the grant is the east line of the public lands. The sole question is whether the strip of land in dispute lies within the limits of the grant. \n1\n This depends entirely upon the location of the west boundary of the grant.\n The Mora Grant was originally a community grant made by the Republic of Mexico in 1835. The west boundary was described as 'the Estillero.' After the cession to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the claim under this grant was confirmed by Congress by the Act of June 21, 1860, c. 167, 12 Stat. 71. The grant was surveyed, in 1861, by Thomas Means, a Deputy United States Surveyor, under instructions of the United States Surveyor General for New Mexico. The patent, after setting forth the descriptive notes of Means' survey, authenticated by the Surveyor General, granted to the patentees 'the tract of land embraced and described in the foregoing survey,' covering an area of more than 800,000 acres. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The survey describes the west boundary as a line more than thirty- three miles long, running south from the northwest corner, a point 'inaccessible in the mountain and not set,' passing successively, at given distances, a large stone marked W.B.M.G. and EO., with given bearings to aspen and pine trees marked W.B.M.G., and Estillero and a stone marked W.B. M.G.; a trail to Picuris; the Pueblo river; and a large stone at the foot of a high mountain, marked W.B.M.G.: and ending at a large stone on the bank of the Sapello river, marked S.W.C.M.G. \n\n[264 U.S. 206, 210]\n\u00a0\n The defendants contend that the west boundary as surveyed by Means is a north and south line passing through 'the Estillero,' and now established by stones marked by Means and by the natural objects called for in the survey. The Government contends that it is located more than three miles farther east, as established by a survey made for the Government by one Comption in 1909\n\n\n The District Judge, in an opinion reviewing the evidence, found that 'the Estillero,' at which Means was instructed to establish the west boundary of the grant, is a place in the valley of the Pueblo river; that no monuments were found on or near the so-called Compton line; and that the west boundary 'being established from the evidence on the ground, that is, natural objects-the Estillero, the trail to Picuris, and Pueblo river, and the permanent monuments, stone marked EO on one side and W.B.M.G. on the other, stone marked W.B.M.G. and stone south of the Pueblo marked W.B. M.G., all now being located in the relative positions called for in the patent, these calls for natural objects and permanent monuments on the ground definitely located' must control. He therefore concluded that the west boundary of the grant is a north and south line drawn through the monuments set by Means in 1861 at the Estillero on the Pueblo river and now in place on the ground; and that the United States by the patent had conveyed the land lying east of this line and has no title thereto. A decree was accordingly entered in favor of the defendants; quieting their title to the land in dispute against any adverse claim of the United States. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n On an appeal taken by the United States, the Circuit Court of Appeals, again reviewing the evidence, concurred in the finding of the District Court as to the location of the Estillero; found that the so-called Compton line ran about three miles east of the monuments at the \n\n[264 U.S. 206, 211]\n\u00a0\n Estillero, did not cross the Pueblo river, and was 'without support'; and held that the west boundary of the grant is 'the north and south line through Means' monuments at the Estillero,' as had been found by the District Court. The decree of that court was accordingly affirmed. 285 Fed. 128.\n\n 1. \nThe questions where the line run by a survey lies on the ground, and whether any particular tract is on one side or the other of that line, are questions of fact. Russell v. Land Grant Co., \n158 \nU.S. 253, 259\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 827. In the present case both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals have found, from the evidence, that the west line of Means' survey lies upon the ground in the location claimed by the defendants, and that the land in dispute is east of that line and within the boundary of the grant. Under the well settled rule these concurrent findings on questions of fact will be accepted by this court unless clear error is shown. Wright-Blodgett Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 397, 402\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 339; Bodkin v. Edwards, \n255 \nU.S. 221, 223\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 268; Brewer Oil Co. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 77, 86\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 60. An examination of the evidence-which need not be recited here-discloses no such error; and, on the contrary, leads us to the conclusion that the findings of the lower courts are in accordance with the greater weight of the testimony.\n\n 2. \nThese findings, although extending the lines of the grant farther west and south than the distances called for in the survey, do not involve any erroneous application of the law. The west line of the grant was correctly located by reference to the Estillero, the marked stones and the natural objects called for. The general rule is that in matters of boundaries calls for natural objects and fixed monuments control those for distances. Newsom v. Pryor, 7 Wheat. 7, 9; Higuera v. United States, 5 Wall. 827, 835; Security Land Co. v. Burns, \n193 \nU.S. 167, 179\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 425; Silver King Co. v. Conkling Co., \n255 \nU.S. 151, 161\n, 41 S. Sup.

And calls for courses likewise prevail over those for distances. Ewart v. Squire, 239 Fed. 34, 36, 152 C. C. A. 84. No ground appears here for any exception to these rules.\n\n 3. \nThe District Court did not err in refusing to admit public land surveys made in 1882 as evidence showing the closing of such surveys on the west boundary of the grant, and decisions of the Land Department holding that its west boundary was along the line run by Compton. Although the power to correct surveys of the public land belongs to the political department of the Government and the Land Department has jurisdiction to decide as to such matters while the land is subject to its supervision and before it takes final action (Cragin v. Powell, \n128 \nU.S. 691, 698\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 203; Knight v. Land Association, \n142 \nU.S. 161, 177\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 258; Kirwan v. Murphy, \n189 \nU.S. 35, 54\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 599), this power of supervision and correction by the Department is 'subject to the necessary and decided limitation' that when it has once made and approved a governmental survey of public lands, and has disposed of them, the courts may protect the private rights acquired against interference by corrective surveys subsequently made by the Department (Cragin v. Powell, supra, p. 699). A resurvey by the United States after the issuance of a patent does not affect the rights of the patentee; the Government, after conveyance of the lands, having 'no jurisdiction to intermeddle with them in the form of a second survey.' Kean v. Canal Co., \n190 \nU.S. 452, 461\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 651, 652 (67 L. Ed. 1134). And although the United States, so long as it has not conveyed its land, may survey and resurvey what it owns, and establish and re-establish boundaries, what it thus does is 'for its own information' and 'cannot affect the rights of owners on the other side of the line already existing.'

Clark, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 189, 192]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Supplee-Biddle Hardware Company sued the United States in the Court of Claims to recover $55,153.89, with interest, as taxes illegally assessed on the proceeds of two life insurance policies paid to it as the beneficiary on the death in 1918 of the insured, Robert Biddle, 2d. Biddle was elected president of the company in February, 1917. He was then 37 years of age, in good health, and had for nearly 20 years held various offices in the Biddle Hardware Company, which had merged with the appellee company in January, 1914. He was a man of ability, energy, and initiative, and was so regarded in the hardware trade. The returns from the company's business under Biddle's management had been much increased. At the instance of the board of directors and the expense of the company, he took out the two policies for $50,000 each. They were term policies for 5 years. The company intended thus to make secure its financial position, and to indemnify itself against losses to its earning power in the event of Biddle's death.\n The Revenue Act of 1918, which was passed February 24, 1919 (40 Stat. 1057, c. 18), in prescribing the income to be taxed, deals first with individuals, from section 212 to \n\n[265 U.S. 189, 193]\n\u00a0\n section 228 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 f-6336 1\/8 n), inclusive. Then follow provisions for the rate of income tax on corporations, beginning with section 230 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 nn). Section 233(a), being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 p, says that 'In the case of a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 230 the term 'gross income' means the gross income as defined in section 213,' with certain exceptions not here material. Section 213 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919;  6336 1\/8 ff) defines the gross income for individuals as follows:\n'That for the purposes of this title (except as otherwise provided in section 233) the term 'gross income'--\n\n'(a) Includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service ... of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits, and income derived from any source whatever; ... but\n\n'(b) Does not include the following items, which shall be exempt from taxation under this title:\n\n'(1) The proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death of the insured to individual beneficiaries or to the estate of the insured.'\n\n The Treasury Department, construing these sections, held that the proceeds of insurance policies, paid to a beneficiary which was a corporation, were not exempted and were included as 'gains ... from any source whatever.' Under this ruling the appellee was forced to pay a tax of $84,737.95 on the proceeds of the two policies of $97,947.28. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue reduced this amount by $29,584.06 in accordance with the powers conferred upon him by sections 327 and 328 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 7\/16 j, 6336 7\/6 k) to reduce the rate of taxation in cases of unusual hardship. There remained, however, the sum of $55,153.89, which tax the appellees paid under \n\n[265 U.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n protest, and for this, with interest, the Court of Claims gave judgment to the appellee.\n We think the Treasury Department erred in assuming that Congress intended by sections 233 and 213 to distinguish between individual beneficiaries and corporate beneficiaries in including the proceeds of life insurance policies as within gross income. We think the two sections have no such purpose. Section 213 primarily applies only to the taxing of individuals. The union of proceeds of life insurance payable to individual beneficiaries and to the estate of the assured was thus intended to emphasize the exclusion from taxation in the hands of individuals of all such proceeds and to leave no doubt of it. The meaning is the same as if the clause had read:\n'The proceeds of life insurance shall not be included in gross income whether they are paid to individual beneficiaries or to the estate of the assured.'\n\n When Congress came to deal with the gross income of corporations, it made use of section 213 by reference and grafted it on to 233. It is reasonable that the purpose of section 213 to exclude entirely the proceeds of life insurance policies from taxation in the case of individuals should be given the same effect in adapting its application to corporations, and that such proceeds should be so excluded whether by the direction of the insured they were to go to specially named beneficiaries or were to inure to the estate of the insured.\n Nor do we find any difficulty with the expression in paragraph (b) which exempts proceeds of life insurance from gross income. The word is used, not to indicate that they would be otherwise included in the income to be taxed, but only to make clear that the gross does not include them.\n It is earnestly pressed upon us that proceeds of life insurance paid on the death of the insured are in fact capital and cannot be taxed as income under the Sixteenth Amendment. Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570; \n\n[265 U.S. 189, 195]\n\u00a0\n Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 \nU.S. 509, 518\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 386, 15 A. L. R. 1305. We are not required to meet this question. It is enough to sustain our construction of the act to say that proceeds of a life insurance policy paid on the death of the insured are not usually classed as income.\n Life insurance in such a case as the one before us is valid and is not a wagering contract. There was certainly an insurable interest on the part of the company in the life of Biddle. Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York v. Board, 115 Va. 836, 80 S. E. 565, L. R. A. 1915F, 979; Keckley v. Coshocton G. Co., 86 Ohio St. 213, 99 N. E. 299, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 607; Mechanics' National Bank v. Comins, 72 N. H. 12, 55 Atl. 191, 101 Am. St. Rep. 650; United Security Life & Trust Co. v. Brown, 270 Pa. 264, 113 Atl. 443. Life insurance in such a case is, like that of fire and marine insurance, a contract of indemnity. Central Bank of Washington v. Hume, \n128 U.S. 195\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 41. The benefit to be gained by death has no periodicity. It is a substitution of money value for something permanently lost, either in a house, a ship, or a life. Assuming, without deciding, that Congress could call the proceeds of such indemnity, income, and validly tax it as such, we think that, in view of the popular conception of the life insurance as resulting in a single addition of a total sum to the resources of the beneficiary, and not in a periodical return, such a purpose on its part should be express, as it certainly is not here.\n This view is strengthened by the fact that under section 402, p. 1097, of the same Revenue Law of 1918 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/4 c), a decedent's estate tax is levied, with rates ranging from 1 per centum to 25 per centum on the net estate which is made to include (paragraph f) 'the amount receivable by the executor as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life; and to the extent of the excess over $40,000 of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life.' The result of the construction put by the government upon sections 233, 230 and 213 \n\n[265 U.S. 189, 196]\n\u00a0\n would be to impose a double tax on the proceeds of the two policies in this case over and above $40,000; i. e., an income tax and an estate tax. Such a duplication, even in an exigent war tax measure, is to be avoided, unless required by express words.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","194":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Tuller, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellees. \n\n[265 U.S. 472, 481]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the United States, as guardian of certain Mission Indians, to quiet in them a 'perpetual right' to occupy, use, and enjoy a part of a confirmed Mexican land grant in Southern California, for which the defendants hold a patent from the United States. The District Court dismissed the bill, as not showing a cause of action, and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 288 Fed. 821.\n The grant was made by Mexico in 1843. After California was ceded to the United States, Congress, in 1851, passed an act providing for the ascertainment and adjudication of private land claims in the ceded territory. 9 Stat. 631, c. 41. The act created a commission to consider and pass on such claims; provided for a review in the District Court of that district, and for a further review in this court; required that the claims be presented to the commission within 2 years, in default of which they were to be regarded as abandoned; provided for the issue of patents on such as were confirmed; and declared the patents should be 'conclusive between the United States and the said claimants,' but should not 'affect the interests of third persons.' This grant was presented to the commission, and, after a hearing in which the United States participated, was confirmed. On an appeal by the United States the District Court affirmed that decision, and a further appeal to this court was abandoned \n\n[265 U.S. 472, 482]\n\u00a0\n and dismissed. Thereafter, in 1863, the patent under which the defendants claim was issued.\n The bill alleges that under the laws of Mexico the Indians in whose behalf the bill is brought became entitled to the 'continuous and undisturbed' occupancy and use of a part of the lands in the grant before it was made; that the Indians were in open, notorious, and adverse occupancy of such lands at the date of the grant; and that they ever since have remained in such occupancy, save as they have been more or less disturbed by the defendants and their predecessors at different times since the patent issued. The bill was brought in 1920. It does not question the validity of the grant or of the patent, but proceeds on the theory that the grant was made, and the title under the patent is held, subject to a 'perpetual right' in the Indians and their descendants to occupy and use the lands in question. The Indians never presented their claim to the commission, nor did the United States do so for them.\n The courts below held that the claim of the Indians, if they had any, was abandoned and lost by the failure to present it to the commission, and that the patent issued on the confirmation of the grant passed the full title, unincumbered by any right in the Indians. In so holding, those courts gave effect to what they understood to be the decision of this court in Barker v. Harvey, \n181 U.S. 481\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 690.\n The questions to be considered here are whether the decision in that case covers this case, and, if it does, whether it should be followed or overruled. That was a suit by the owner of a Mexican grant in Southern California against Mission Indians to quiet his title under a confirmation and patent against their claim to a permanent right to occupy and use a part of the lands. In the state court, where the suit was brought, the plaintiff had a decree, which the Supreme Court of the state affirmed. \n\n[265 U.S. 472, 483]\n\u00a0\n In the right of the Indians the United States then brought the case here, and took charge of and presented it for them. This court sustained the decision of the state courts.\n In the trial court the Indians had produced evidence tending to show that they and their ancestors had been occupying and using the lands openly and continuously from a time anterior to the Mexican grant, and that while they remained under the dominion of Mexico that government protected them in their right and recognized its permanency. But at the conclusing of the trial that evidence had been stricken out over their objection, because it appeared that their claim had not been presented to the commission under the act of 1851. On the evidence remaining the decree necessarily had been against them. Thus the question presented was whether there was error in striking out the evidence of their prior occupancy and use, and of the permanency of their right as recognized by Mexico.\n This court, after observing that under the treaty with Mexico and the rules of international law the United States was bound to respect the rights of private property in the ceded territory, said there could be no doubt of the power of the United States, consistently with such obligation, to provide reasonable means for determining the validity of all titles within the ceded territory, to require all claims to lands therein to be presented for examination, and to declare that all not presented should be regarded as abandoned. The court further said the purpose of the act of 1851 was to give repose to titles as well as to fulfill treaty obligations, and that it not only permitted, but required, all claims to be presented to the commission, and barred all from future assertion which were not presented within the 2 years. Earlier decisions, showing the effect theretofore given to patents issued under the act, were cited and approved; and, coming \n\n[265 U.S. 472, 484]\n\u00a0\n to the provision that the patent shall not 'affect the interests of third persons,' the court held, as it had done in a prior case:\n'The term 'third persons,' as there used, does not embrace all persons other than the United States and the claimants, but only those who hold superior titles, such as will enable them to resist successfully any action of the government in disposing of the property.'\n\n The court then proceeded:\n'If these Indians had any claims founded on the action of the Mexican government, they abandoned them by not presenting them to the commission for consideration, and they could not, therefore, in the language just quoted, 'resist successfully any action of the government in disposing of the property.' If it be said that the Indians do not claim the fee, but only the right of occupation, and therefore they do not come within the provision of section 8 as persons 'claiming lands in California by virtue of any right or title derived from the Spanish or Mexican government,' it may be replied that a claim of a right to permanent occupancy of land is one of far- reaching effect, and it could not well be said that lands which were burdened with a right of permanent occupancy were a part of the public domain and subject to the full disposal of the United States. There is an essential difference between the power of the United States over lands to which it had had full title, and of which it has given to an Indian tribe a temporary occupancy, and that over lands which were subjected by the action of some prior government to a right of permanent occupancy, for in the latter case the right, which is one of private property, antecedes and is superior to the title of this government, and limits necessarily its power of disposal. Surely a claimant would have little reason for presenting to the land commission his claim to land, and securing a confirmation of that claim, if the only result was to transfer the naked fee to him, burdened by an Indian right of permanent occupancy. \n\n[265 U.S. 472, 485]\n\u00a0\n 'Again, it is said that the Indians were, prior to the cession, the wards of the Mexican government, and by the cession became the wards of this government; that therefore the United States are bound to protect their interests; and that all administration, if not all legislation, must be held to be interpreted by, if not subordinate to, this duty of protecting the interests of the wards. It is undoubtedly true that this government has always recognized the fact that the Indians were its wards, and entitled to be protected as such, and this court has uniformly construed all legislation in the light of this recognized obligation. But the obligation is one which rests upon the political department of the government, and this court has never assumed, in the absence of congressional action, to determine what would have been appropriate legislation, or to decide the claims of the Indians as though such legislation had been had. Our attention has been called to no legislation by Congress having special reference to these particular Indians. By the act creating the land commission the commissioners were required (section 16) 'to ascertain and report to the Secretary of the Interior the tenure by which the mission lands are held, and those held by civilized Indians and those who are engaged in agriculture or labor of any kind, and also those which are occupied and cultivated by Pueblos or Rancheros Indians.' It is to be assumed that the commissioners performed that duty, and that Congress, in the discharge of its obligation to the Indians, did all that it deemed necessary, and as no action has been shown in reference to these particular Indians, or their claims to these lands, it is fairly to be deduced that Congress considered that they had no claims which called for special action.'\n\n Enough has been said to make it apparent that that case and this are so much alike that what was said and \n\n[265 U.S. 472, 486]\n\u00a0\n ruled in that should be equally applicable in this. But it is urged that what we have described as ruled there was obiter dictum, and should be disregarded, because the court there gave a second ground for its decision, which was broad enough to sustain it independently of the first ground. The premise of the contention is right, but the conclusion is wrong; for where there are two grounds, upon either of which an appellate court may rest its decision, and it adopts both, 'the ruling on neither is obiter, but each is the judgment of the court, and of equal validity with the other.' Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Mason City & Ft. Dodge R. R. Co., \n199 \nU.S. 160, 166\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 19, 20 (50 L. Ed. 134); Railroad Companies v. Schutte, \n103 U.S. 118\n, 143.\n The question whether that decision shall be followed here or overruled admits of but one answer. The decision was given 23 years ago, and affected many tracts of land in California, particularly in the southern part of the state. In the meantime there has been a continuous growth and development in that section, land values have enhanced, and there have been many transfers. Naturally there has been reliance on the decision. The defendants in this case purchased 15 years after it was made. It has become a rule of property, and to disturb it now would be fraught with many injurious results. Besides, the government and the scattered Mission Indians have adjusted their situation to it in several instances. As long ago as Minnesota Co. v. National Co., 3 Wall. 332, this court said ( page 334 [18 L. Ed. 42]):\n'Where questions arise which affect titles to land, it is of great importance to the public that, when they are once decided, they should no longer be considered open. Such decisions become rules of property, and many titles may be injuriously affected by their change. Legislatures may alter or change their laws, without injury, as they affect the future only; but where courts vacillate, and overrule their own decisions on the construction of statutes affecting \n\n[265 U.S. 472, 487]\n\u00a0\n the title to real property, their decisions are retrospective, and may affect titles purchased on the faith of their stability, Doubtful questions on subjects of this nature, when once decided, should be considered no longer doubtful or subject to change.'\n\n That rule often has been applied in this and other courts, and we think effect should be given to it in the present case.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. VALANTE(1924)\nNo. 218\nArgued: Decided: April 21, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. George Ross Hull, of Washington, D. C., and the Attorney General, for the United States.\n Mr. Abner Siegal, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from an order sustaining a writ of habeas corpus and discharging Valante from custody.\n He was tried in the District Court upon a criminal information charging him with misdemeanors under the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/4 et seq.). The judge of another federal district presided. The testimony was heard; and the jury was charged and retired to deliberate. Not having agreed upon a verdict by the time that the judge was to return to his home, it was stipulated by the district attorney and Valante's counsel that any other federal judge might receive the verdict and impose sentence, if necessary. The \n\n[264 U.S. 563, 564]\n\u00a0\n jury later returned a verdict of 'guilty.' A judge of the district then presiding received the verdict, and, although his authority so to do was at that time challenged, sentenced Valante to thirty days' imprisonment in the city prison. There was no motion for a new trial or application for a writ of error. Valante was surrendered to the marshal and delivered into the custody of the warden of the prison for the purpose of serving the sentence. He thereupon presented a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he had been illegally sentenced in violation of his 'constitutional rights and privileges' in that the verdict was received and sentence imposed by a judge having no jurisdiction. The writ was issued, and upon a hearing on the petition and the return made by the warden, the writ was sustained and Valante was discharged from custody The United States has appealed directly to this court. Judicial Code,  238 ( Comp. St.  1215); McCarthy v Arndstein, \n262 U.S. 355\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 562\n\n\n Valente's contention is that the constitutional provision that the trial of all crimes shall be by jury (article 3,  2, cl. 3), requires the continuous presence of the same judge throughout the trial until the final judgment, and that, although this was a misdemeanor case, the substitution of another judge before the verdict was received and the sentence imposed, was not a mere irregularity which could be waived by his consent, but a violation of the constitutional provision for a jury trial. Without intimating that there is anything of substance in this contention, it is clear that the error, if any was committed, did not go to the jurisdiction of the court or render the judgment void, but was, at the most, one which could have been corrected on a review by writ of error. It is 'the well- established general rule that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be utilized for the purpose of proceedings in error.' Craig v. Hecht, \n263 \nU.S. 255, 277\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 103, 106 (68 L. Ed. --), and cases there cited. And see Riddle v. Dyche, \n262 \nU.S. 333, 335\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 555. There are no \n\n[264 U.S. 563, 565]\n\u00a0\n circumstances in the present case sufficiently extraordinary to bring it within any class of 'exceptional cases' or make 'the general rules of procedure' inapplicable. Craig v. Hecht, supra, p. 277.\n The writ of habeas corpus could not be used in this case as a substitute for a writ of error. The order sustaining the writ and discharging Valante from custody is accordingly reversed; and the cause will be remanded to the District Court with instructions to vacate the order, discharge the writ, and remand Valante to the custody of the warden.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. WEISSMAN(1924)\nNo. 391\nArgued: Decided: December 15, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n Mr. Benjamin Slade, of New York City, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error taken by the United States under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704). The indictment is for a conspiracy to conceal assets in contemplation of the bankruptcy of Joseph Weissman, alleged to have continued up to and including \n\n[266 U.S. 377, 378]\n\u00a0\n the day when a petition in bankruptcy was filed. There is also a count for concealing and causing to be concealed assets after the adjudication and the appointment of trustees. It is unnecessary to follow the vicissitudes and oscillations of the case before the time that the defendants in error were finally before a jury for trial. At that time the Court, after reciting to the jury some of the previous steps, stated that as it had concluded that the indictment was invalid because no offence was properly charged and therefore no valid conviction could be had, it would dispose of the case by directing a general verdict of not guilty. A verdict of not guilty was rendered, subject to exceptions, on which the Government seeks to come here.\n Apart from other objections and without going further, the Government is met by the proviso in the Criminal Appeals Act: 'That no writ of error shall be taken by or allowed the United States in any case where there has been a verdict in favor of the defendant.' It is argued that the verdict is a nullity because nothing had been submitted to the jury, no evidence, not even an opening statement, and that the judgment should be treated as in substance sustaining a demurrer to the indictment or quashing it. It is hard to see what good this would do the Government, as even then, unless we go behind the judgment and what was said at the trial, and possibly in any event, the direction would seem to have been based on a construction of the indictment and not upon a construction of the statutes of the United States.\n But we are of opinion that no such narrowing construction can be put upon the Criminal Appeals Act for the purpose of enlarging the Government's right of review. The words taken literally refer simply to the matter of fact that there 'has been a verdict'-not qualified by any consideration of whether it was right or wrong. In like manner a writ of error from a judgment sustaining a special plea in bar is given only 'when the defendant has \n\n[266 U.S. 377, 379]\n\u00a0\n not been put in jeopardy.' Furthermore if directing the verdict was wrong it certainly was not beyond the jurisdiction of the Court. The jury were there and the prisoners before them, and so far as jurisdiction is concerned it did not matter whether evidence had been put in or not. We stop at the point of jurisdiction, the want of which would be the only pretext that could be offered for going behind the literal meaning of the statute. But we do not mean to imply that an opening by counsel or the offer of evidence is necessary in order to justify directing a verdict of not guilty; there are other cases in which it is done.\n It is suggested that the course adopted in this case offers to the lower court a means of escaping the review allowed by the act; and there is an innuendo that there was a desire of that sort below. But such considerations do not affect the construction of the act, and it is fair to say that while the judge should not have directed a verdict when he did so, and if he thought the indictment bad should have quashed it before the jury came in, and left the question in form to be taken up, still we see no sufficient reason for supposing that the direction was given with any notion of escaping the jurisdiction of this Court.\n Writ dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. EX REL. TISI v. TOD(1924)\nNo. 132\nArgued: January 3, 1924Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 131, 132]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

Gen., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Tisi, an alien, was arrested in deportation proceedings as being within the United States in violation of law. The ground specified was knowingly having in his possession for the purpose of distribution printed matter which advocated the overthrow of the government of the United States by force. Act of October 16, 1918, c. 186,  1 and 2, 40 Stat. 1012 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 b\n\n[264 U.S. 131, 1]\n\u00a0\n, 4289 1\/4 b\n\n[264 U.S. 131, 2]\n\u00a0\n), as amended by Act of June 5, 1920, c. 251, 41 Stat. 1008 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  4289 1\/4 b\n\n[264 U.S. 131, 1]\n\u00a0\n). The warrant of deportation issued after a hearing. Then this petition for a writ of habeas corpus was brought in the federal court, and heard upon the return and a traverse thereto. The order, entered without opinion, dismissed the writ, remanded the relator to the custody of the commissioner of immigration at the port of New York, and granted a stay, pending the appeal to this court. The case is here under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), the claim being that Tisi was denied rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution.\n Tisi's claim to be discharged on habeas corpus rests wholly upon the contention that he has been denied due process of law. There was confessedly due notice of the charge and ample opportunity to be heard. What Tisi \n\n[264 U.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n URGES IS THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUstain the finding that he knew the seditious character of the printed matter. Such knowledge is not, like alienage, a jurisdictional fact. Ng Fung Ho v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 492; United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, \n263 U.S. 149\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 54, 68 L. Ed. --, decided, November 12, 1923. But it is an essential of the authority to deport. There is no suggestion that the Secretary of Labor failed to recognize this requirement. The contention is that he erred in deciding that there was substantial evidence of such knowledge and in allowing the supposed evidence to convince him of the fact. The printed matter found consisted of leaflets in the English language. Tisi testified that he cannot read English, that he did not know the character of the leaflets, and that his presence in the company of other Italians who were seen folding the leaflets was accidental. The Secretary of Labor was not obliged to believe this testimony. The government did not introduce any direct evidence to the contrary. But there was much evidence of other facts from which Tisi's knowledge of the character of the leaflets might reasonably have been inferred. We do not discuss the evidence, because the correctness of the judgment of the lower court is not to be determined by inquiring whether the conclusion drawn by the Secretary of Labor from the evidence was correct, or by deciding whether the evidence was such that, if introduced in a court of law, it would be held legally sufficient to prove the fact found.\n The denial of a fair hearing is not established by proving merely that the decision was wrong. Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 8, 13\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 201. This is equally true whether the error consists in deciding wrongly that evidence introduced constituted legal evidence of the fact or in drawing a wrong inference from the evidence. The error of an administrative tribunal may, of course, be so flagrant as to convince a court that the hearing had was not a fair one. Compare United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, \n263 U.S. 149\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 54, 68 L. Ed. --, decided November 12, 1923; Kwock Jan Fat v. White, \n253 U.S. 454\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 566; Zakonaite \n\n[264 U.S. 131, 134]\n\u00a0\n v. Wolf, \n226 U.S. 272\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 31: Tang Tun v. Edsell, \n223 U.S. 673\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 359. But here no hasty, arbitrary, or unfair action on the part of any official, or any abuse of discretion, is shown. There is no claim that the lack of legal evidence of knowledge was manifest, or that the finding was made in willful disregard of the evidence to the contrary, or that settled rules of evidence were ignored. The procedure prescribed by the rules of the department appears to have been followed in every respect, and the legality of that prescribed is not questioned. There is no suggestion that Tisi was not allowed to prepare for the hearing, by prior examination of the written evidence on which the warrant of arrest issued, or that he was otherwise restricted in his preparation of the defense. The hearing was conducted orally. Tisi was present and was represented by counsel. He testified fully, and the many witnesses produced by the government were cross- examined by his counsel. He was given ample time in which to present the evidence, the argument, and a brief. Under these circumstances, mere error, even if it consists in finding an essential fact without adequate supporting evidence, is not a denial of due process of law.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","198":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8583). The order relates to the divisions of interstate joint rates on traffic interchanged, within the United States, by the Kansas City, Mexico & Orient system with 13 carriers whose lines make direct connection with it. The order provides that on all such interchanged traffic the existing divisions of these carriers shall be reduced by a fixed per cent., and that the Orient shall receive the amount so taken from its connections. \n1\n The order also directed the Orient and the connecting carriers to make, at stated intervals, reports of the financial results of the divisions ordered, permitted any carrier to except itself from the order, in whole or in part, by proper showing, and retained jurisdiction in the Commission 'to adjust on the basis of such reports the divisions herein prescribed or stated, if such adjustment shall to us seem proper.' Kansas City, Mexico & Orient Divisions, 73 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 319, 329.\n The order was entered after an investigation into the financial needs of the Orient system, undertaken by the \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 280]\n\u00a0\n Commission in April, 1922, pursuant to an application of the receiver of the Kansas City, Mexico & Orient Railroad Co. and an affiliated Texas corporation. It appeared (and was not denied) that the public interest demanded continued operation of the railroad; that the revenues were insufficient to pay operating expenses; that the operation was being efficiently conducted; and that, unless relief were afforded by increasing the Orient's division of joint rates and\/or otherwise, operation would have to be suspended and the railroad abandoned. \n2\n The 13 carriers who brought this suit participated in the investigation undertaken by the Commission, and supplied certain statistical information requested of them; but that introduced no evidence before the Commission, and the case was submitted there without argument. None of the connecting carriers made application to be excepted from the order. Nor did any of them apply for a rehearing. Before the effective date of the order, this suit was begun. On application for a temporary injunction, it was heard by three judges, pursuant to the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220, and a temporary injunction was granted. Upon final hearing, motions of the defendants to dismiss the bill were denied, the injunction was made permanent, and a rehearing was refused. 288 Fed. 102.\n First. The Commission moved, in the District Court, to dismiss the bill on the ground that the suit was premature. The contention is that, under the rule of Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 U.S. 210\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 67, orderly procedure required that, before invoking judicial review, the \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 281]\n\u00a0\n carriers should have exhausted the administrative remedy afforded by a petition for rehearing before the full Commission. The investigation and order were made, not by the whole Commission, but by division 4.3 The order of a division has 'the same force and effect ... as if made ... by the Commission, subject to rehearing by the Commission.' Interstate Commerce Act as amended,  17(4) being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8586. Any party may apply for such rehearing of any order or matter determined. Section 16a (Comp. St.  8585). Meanwhile the order may be suspended either by the division or by the Commission. In this case, the order, by its terms, was not to become effective until 37 days after its entry. There was, consequently, ample time within which to apply for a rehearing and a stay, before the plaintiffs could have been injured by the order.\n Division 4 consists of 4 members. There are 11 members on the full Commission. Under these circumstances, what is here called a rehearing resembles an appeal to another administrative tribunal. An application for a rehearing before the Commission would have been clearly appropriate. \n4\n The objections to the validity of the order now urged are in part procedural. They include \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 282]\n\u00a0\n questions of joinder of parties, of the admissibility of evidence, and of failure to introduce formal evidence. Most of the objections do not appear to have been raised before the division. If they had been, alleged errors might have been corrected by action of that body or by the full Commission. The order involved also a far-reaching question of administrative power and policy, which, so far as appears, had never been passed upon by the full Commission, and was not discussed by these plaintiffs before the division. In view of these facts, the trial court would have been justified in denying equitable relief until an application had been made to the full Commission, and redress had been denied by it. But, in the absence of a stay, the order of a division is operative, and the filing of an application for a rehearing does not relieve the carrier from the duty of observing an order. \n5\n Despite the failure to apply for a rehearing, the court had jurisdiction to entertain this suit.

Whether it should have denied relief until all possible administrative remedies had been exhausted was a matter which called for the exercise of its judicial discretion. We cannot say that, in denying the motion to dismiss, the discretion was abused.\n Second. The plaintiffs contend that the order is void, because only a part of the carriers who participated in the joint rates were made parties to the proceedings before the Commission. Section 15(6) provides that where existing divisions are found to be 'unjust ... as between the carriers parties thereto ... the Commission shall, by order, prescribe the just, reasonable and equitable divisions thereof to be received by the several \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 283]\n\u00a0\n carriers.' More than 170 carriers participated in the joint rates in question. Of these only 39 carriers, whose roads lie wholly west of the Mississippi river, were made respondents before the Commission. The argument is that all who are parties to the through rates are necessarily interested in the divisions of those rates; that failure to join some is not rendered immaterial by the fact that the order made affects directly only those before the Commission, since it would be open to a carrier whose division is reduced, to seek contribution later by a proceeding to readjust the divisions as between it and other carriers who were not parties to the original case; and that an order under this section is invalid unless it disposes completely of the matter in controversy. This argument is answered by what was said in New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 201\n, 202 S., 43 Sup. Ct. 270. The order, in terms, affects only the 13 carriers whose lines connect directly with the Orient system. Only their divisions were reduced. The shares of all others who participated in the joint rates were left unchanged. All participating carriers might properly have been made respondents. But that was not essential, for it was not necessary that all controversies which may conceivably arise should be settled in a single proceeding. There was no defect of parties in the proceeding before the Commission. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 274, 284]\n\u00a0\n Third. The plaintiffs contend that the order is void because made on a basis which Congress did not and could not authorize. \n7\n The argument is that Transportation Act 1920 requires earnings under joint rates to be divided according to what is fair and reasonable as between the parties; that what is so must be determined by the relative amount and cost of the service performed by each of the several railroads; and that the Commission, ignoring this basis of apportionment and making the determination in the public interest, gave to the needy Orient system larger divisions merely because the connection carriers were more prosperous. Relative cost of service is not the only factor to be considered in determining just divisions. The Commission must consider, also, whether a particular carrier is an originating, intermediate or delivering line; the efficiency with which the several carriers are operated; the amount of revenue required to pay their respective operating expenses, taxes, and a fair return on their railway property; the importance to the public of the transportation service of such carciers; and other facts, if any, which would, ordinarily, without regard to mileage haul, entitle one carrier to a greater or less proportion than another of the joint rate. \n8\n It is settled that, in determining what the divisions should be, the Commission may, in the public interest, take into consideration the financial needs of a weaker road, and that it may be \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 285]\n\u00a0\n given a division larger than justice merely as between the parties would suggest 'in order to maintain it in effective operation as part of an adequate transportation system,' provided the share left to its connections is 'adequate to avoid a confiscatory result.' Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 477\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 169, 68 L. Ed. --; New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 194\n, 195 S., 43 Sup. Ct. 270. It was not contended before the Commission that a reduction of the carriers' divisions would reduce their rates below what is compensatory. \n9\n There is in the record no evidence on which it could be determined that any of the divisions ordered will result in confiscatory rates. And there is nothing in the order which prohibits rate increases. Compare United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 526\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 189, 68 L. Ed. --.\n The assertion is made that the Commission was guided solely by the relative financial ability of the several carriers. In support of this assertion it is pointed out that the increase ordered of the Orient's share was measured, not by a percentage of its own divisions, as in New England Divisions Case, \n261 U.S. 184\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 270, but by a percentage of the revenues of the several connecting carriers from the joint traffic. \n10\n It does not follow that such a basis of division would necessarily be unjust to the connecting carriers. The position of the Orient as the originating carrier, or as the delivering carrier, or as an indispensable \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 286]\n\u00a0\n intermediate carrier, might be such that the connecting carrier could not get the traffic but for the service which the Orient renders, and that this factor, together with others ignored in the existing divisions, would require the precise change directed to render the divisions just and reasonable as between the parties. It is also pointed out that the contributions to be made by the connecting carriers bore a direct relation to their prosperity. But it does not appear that the Commission based its finding solely on the financial needs of the Orient and the financial condition of the connecting carriers.\n Invalidity of the order is urged on the further ground that the Commission made the incidental fact of physical connection with the Orient the sole test for determining which carriers should have their divisions reduced, and that such action is clearly arbitrary. It is true that the order affects, in terms, only the 13 carriers whose lines have direct connection with the Orient; but it does not follow that the action was arbitrary. These connecting carriers have a demonstrable interest in having the operation of the Orient continued. Other carriers doubtless have an interest; but it is less certain. It is open to any of these 13 carriers to institute proceedings before the Commission with a view to securing a partial distribution of their burden among other connecting carriers. Compare United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 526\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 189, 68 L. Ed. --. The basis of division adopted by the Commission is not shown to be, in any respect, inconsistent with the rule declared in New England Divisions Case, \n261 U.S. 184\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 270. Nor is it shown that the Commission ignored any factor of which consideration is required by the act.\n Fourth. The plaintiffs contend that the order is void because it rests upon evidence not legally before the Commission. It is conceded that the finding rests, in part, \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 287]\n\u00a0\n upon data11 taken from the annual reports filed with the Commission by the plaintiff carriers pursuant to law; that these reports were not formally put in evidence; that the parts containing the data relied upon were not put in evidence through excerpts; that attention was not otherwise specifically called to them; and that objection to the use of the reports, under these circumstances, was seasonably made by the carriers and was insisted upon. The parts of the annual reports in question were used as evidence of facts which it was deemed necessary to prove, not as a means of verifying facts of which the Commission, like a court, takes judicial notice. The contention of the Commission is that, because its able examiner gave notice that 'no doubt it will be necessary to refer to the annual reports of all these carriers,' its Rules of Practice12 permitted matter in the reports to \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 288]\n\u00a0\n be used as freely as if the data had been formally introduced in evidence.\n The mere admission by an administrative tribunal of matter which under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings would be deemed incompetent does not invalidate its order. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 44\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 563; Spiller v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117, 131\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 466. Compare Bilokumsky v. Tod, \n263 \nU.S. 149, 157\n, 44 S. Sup. Ct. 54, 68 L. Ed. --. But a finding without evidence is beyond the power of the Commission. Papers in the Commission's files are not always evidence in a case. New England Divisions Case, \n261 U.S. 184\n, 198, note 19, 43 Sup. Ct. 270. Nothing can be treated as evidence which is not introduced as such. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 93 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 185; Chicago Junction Case, \n264 U.S. 258\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 317, 68 L. Ed . --. If the proceeding had been, in form, an adversary one commenced by the Orient system, that carrier could not, under rule XIII, have introduced the annual reports as a whole. For they contain much that is not relevant to the matter in issue. By the terms of the rule, it would have been obliged to submit copies of such portions as it deemed material, or to make specific reference to the exact portion to be used. The fact that the proceeding was technically an investigation instituted by the Commission \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 289]\n\u00a0\n would not relieve the Orient, if a party to it, from this requirement. Every proceeding is adversary, in substance, if it may result in an order in favor of one carrier as against another. Nor was the proceeding under review any the less an adversary one, because the primary purpose of the Commission was to protect the public interest through making possible the continued operation of the Orient system. The fact that it was on the Commission's own motion that use was made of the data in the annual reports is not of legal significance.\n It is sought to justify the procedure followed by the clause in rule XIII which declares that the 'Commission will take notice of items in tariffs and annual or other periodical reports of carriers properly on file.' But this clause does not mean that the Commission will take judicial notice of all the facts contained in such documents. Nor does it purport to relieve the Commission from introducing, by specific reference, such parts of the reports as it wishes to treat as evidence. It means that as to these items there is no occasion for the parties to serve copies. The objection to the use of the data contained in the annual reports is not lack of authenticity or untrustworthiness. It is that the carriers were left without notice of the evidence with which they were, in fact, confronted, as later disclosed by the finding made. The requirement that in an adversary proceeding specific reference be made, is essential to the preservation of the substantial rights of the parties. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The right of the carriers to insist that the consideration of matter not in evidence invalidates the order was not lost by their submission of the case without argument and \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 290]\n\u00a0\n by their acquiescing in the suggestion that the presentation of a tentative report by the examiner be omitted. While the course pursued denied to the Commission the benefit of that full presentation of the contentions of the parties which is often essential to the exercise of sound judgment, it cannot be construed as a waiver by the carriers of their legal rights. The general notice that the Commission would rely upon the voluminous annual reports is tantamount to giving no notice whatsoever. The matter improperly treated as evidence may have been an important factor in the conclusions reached by the Commission. The order must, therefore, be held void.\n Fifth. A further objection of the carriers should be considered. They point out that the record does not contain any tariffs showing the individual joint rates, or any division sheets showing how these individual joint rates are divided, nor any information concerning the amount of service performed by the Orient and its several connections under such individual joint rates. As justification for this omission, it is argued that there are in the record exhibits, furnished by the several carriers, containing data from which the Commission could reach a conclusion as to whether or not the divisions, taken as a whole, were equitable as between the Orient and its several connections;14 that in a general rate case evidence \n\n[265 U.S. 274, 291]\n\u00a0\n 'deemed typical of the whole rate structure' will support a finding as to each rate in the structure by raising a rebuttable presumption concerning each rate; that typical 'evidence' in this sense means, not evidence directly representative of every individual rate, but evidence tending to show the general situation; that a like presumption arises in a division case; that the data dealing with the traffic in the aggregate, which was furnished by the exhibits, constituted such typical evidence; that, in this proceeding, information concerning individual rates and divisions was not essential; and that the course pursued by the examiner is, in substance, that upheld in the New England Divisions Case, \n261 U.S. 184\n, 196-199, 43 Sup. Ct. 270.\n The argument is not sound. The power conferred by Congress on the Commission is that of determining, in respect to each joint rate, what divisions will be just. Evidence of individual rates or divisions, said to be typical of all, affords a basis for a finding as to any one. But averages are apt to be misleading. It cannot be inferred that every existing division of every joint rate is unjust as between particular carriers, because the aggregate result of the movement of the traffic on joint rates appears to be unjust. These aggregate results should properly be taken into consideration by the Commission; but it was not proper to accept them as a substitute for typical evidence as to the individual joint rates and divisions. In the New England Divisions Case, tariffs and division sheets were introduced which, in the opinion of the Commission were typical in character, and ample in quantity, to justify the findings made in respect to each division of each rate of every carrier. A like course should have been pursued in the proceeding under review.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The percentage of the reduction prescribed in respect to the several carriers ranges from 10 to 30 per cent. Thus, the Missouri Pacific's division was shrunk 20 per cent. It was estimated that the resulting reduction of its revenues would be $115,789.22. That amount, added to the existing share of the Orient on this traffic, would increase its division, on weighted average, over 14 per cent. The Texas & Pacific's division was also shrunk 20 per cent. The estimated resulting reduction of its revenues would be $121,140.81. But that amount, added to the existing share of the Orient on this traffic, would increase its division about 25 per cent. The order differs from that upheld in New England Divisions Case, \n261 U.S. 184\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 270; which prescribed a percentage increase of the division of the New England roads and directed that the amount of the increase be taken from the existing shares of the several connecting carriers. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] These needs had been the subject of repeated enquiries by the Commission in connection with the granting and the renewal of a loan from the United States under section 210 of Transportation Act, 1920 (Comp.

An increase of the Orient's division 25 per cent. would have reduced the Santa Fe's division only 6 1\/4 per cent., while the order made, by reducing the Santa Fe's division 25 per cent., increases that of the Orient 100 per cent. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] These include for each of the carriers the data showing for the year freight tons, one mile; passengers, one mile; all revenue car miles; all revenue train miles; the total operating revenue; total operating expenses; net revenue and investment in road and equipment-and they involved calculation of the respective gross revenues per ton mile, per car mile, per train mile; operating expenses per train mile, per car mile, per ton mile; net revenue per ton mile, per car mile, per train mile; the return per $1,000 of investment, on the gross revenue, the net revenue, and the railway operating income; the percentage of return on the gross revenue, the net revenue and the operating income.

The Commission will take notice of items in tariffs and annual or other periodical reports of carriers properly on file with it or in annual, statistical, or other official reports of the Commission. When it is desired to direct the Commission's attention to such tariffs or reports upon hearing or in briefs or argument it must be done with the precision specified in the second preceding sentence. In case any testimony in other proceedings than the one on hearing is introduced in evidence, a copy of such testimony must be presented as an exhibit.

For example: The exhibits showed that, during 1921, the Santa Fe and the Orient interchanged 26,278 tons of freight; that with respect to such freight the Orient performed 8, 162,294 ton miles of transportation and the Santa Fe 5,793,098 ton miles; that the revenue arising from this joint service was $218,827.71, of which the Orient received $106,889.59 and the Santa Fe $111,938.12; that the per ton mile revenue of the Orient was 1.309 cents and the per ton mile revenue of the Santa Fe 1.932 cents. \n\n\n\n\n","199":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8583) directs that the Commission 'shall whenever deemed by it necessary or desirable in the public interest ... establish through routes.' Paragraph 4 of that section provides:\n'In establishing any such through route the Commission shall not ... require any carrier by railroad, without its consent, to embrace in such route substantially less than the entire length of its railroad and of any intermediate railroad operated in conjunction and under a common management or control therewith, which lies between the termini of such proposed through route, unless such inclusion of lines would make the through route unreasonably long as compared with another practicable through route which could otherwise be established.'\n\n That is, the Commission shall not compel the carrier to short haul its traffic. The main question for decision is whether the American Railway Express Company, which uses the railroads for its transportation service as described in Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 \nU.S. 175, 177\n, 178 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 93, is itself a 'carrier by railroad' within the meaning of paragraph 4. \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 428]\n\u00a0\n The American was organized, in June, 1918, as a war measure, to take over the express business done on the railroads which had come under federal control. After the government relinquished such control, this consolidation of the transportation business and property of the express companies was approved by the Commission, under paragraph 7 of section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Transportation Act 1920 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8567). Consolidation of Express Co., 59 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 459. Uniform contracts were entered into by the American with substantially all the railroads of the United States ( Express Contract, 1920, 59 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 518); and it enjoyed a practical monopoly of the railroad express business until May 1, 1921. On that day the Southeastern Express Company entered the field, by utilizing for that purpose the Southern Railway System and affiliated lines, in all about 10,000 miles of railroad. Many cities and towns in the Southeastern States are now served both by the American and by the Southeastern. These are called common points. A larger number in those states are served only by one of the companies. These are called exclusive points. Except in the Southeastern States, practically all railroad express offices in the United States are exclusive points of the American.\n The Southeastern sought to have the American agree with it to establish through routes and joint rates between all points served by them respectively, whether common points or exclusive, and to permit the shipper to give the routing instruction. The American declined to do this, limiting its concurrence to routes between the exclusive points of one company and the exclusive points of the other. In this way it attempted to secure to itself either the entire haul or the longest possible haul. Thereupon the Southeastern instituted, before the Commission, proceedings against the American, praying that the Commission establish the through routes and joint rates sought. Another proceeding, seeking in part like relief, was brought against the two express companies by shippers' \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 429]\n\u00a0\n associations. The cases were consolidated. The Commission ordered the establishment of some of the through routes prayed for,1 finding that, in order to secure adequate service, it was necessary and desirable in the public interest that competitive joint routes be established, although the American had reasonable routes from origin to destination, or from origin to a point nearer destination than the joint through routes established. \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 430]\n\u00a0\n Southeastern Express Co. v. American Railway Express Co., 78 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 126; Id., 81 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 247.\n Before the effective date of the order, this suit to enjoin its enforcement was brought by the American against the United States in the federal court for Northern Georgia. The Seaboard Air Line Railway, one of the many railroads with which the American has a contract, intervened as plaintiff. The Commission, the Southeastern, the Southern Traffic League, and other shippers' associations intervened as defendants. The case was heard on application for a temporary injunction by three judges, pursuant to the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 220; the order was held void on the ground that the American is a 'carrier by railroad,' within the meaning of paragraph 4, and that therefore the Commission was, on the facts found, without power to make the order, and a temporary injunction2 was granted, Circuit Judge Bryan dissenting. 293 Fed. 31. The case is here on separate appeals from that decision by the several respondents. The three appeals present the same questions of law.\n First. The power to establish through routes is conferred broadly as to all carriers by paragraph 3 of section 15.3 The limitation upon the power in respect to a 'carrier by railroad' is imposed by paragraph 4. The language \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 431]\n\u00a0\n which embodies this limitation is not appropriate to describe the situation of an express company. It is that the Commission may not compel the carrier to embrace in the through route 'substantially less than the entire length of its railroad and of any intermediate railroad operated in conjunction and under a common management or control therewith, which lies between the termini of such proposed through route, unless ....' An express company has no railroad. It is served by many railroads, as it is served by water lines, by motor trucks, and by horses and wagons. Moreover, the language of \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 432]\n\u00a0\n paragraph 4 describes aptly a single railroad system, but not a system of express routes extending over many separate railroad systems. Practically every express company has had, as the American has now, routes over many separate railroad system. \n4\n However numerous the railroads used, all the routes are parts of a single express system. \n5\n If an express company is a 'carrier by railroad,' the 'entire length of its railroad' must, as the American argues, be construed to mean the entire length of all the lines of the railroads within the United States over which it has routes. Such a construction would, if adopted, tend to give permanency to an existing monopoly although it failed to give adequate service. For it would deprive the Commission of power to foster the competition found necessary to secure such service. There is nothing in Transportation Act 1920 which evinces in intention on the part of Congress to accomplish such a purpose.\n The natural meaning of the term 'carrier by railroad' is one who operates a railroad, not one whose shipments are carried by a railroad. The term is not found in the original Act to Regulate Commerce, which was applicable only to carriers 'engaged in the transportation of passengers \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 433]\n\u00a0\n or property wholly by railroad, or partly by railroad and partly by water.' 6 When the amendment of 1906 extended the Commission's jurisdiction to express companies, sleeping car companies and pipe lines, and that of 1910 extended its jurisdiction to telegraph, telephone and cable companies, occasion for differentiating between carriers arose, as some of the provisions of the Act to Regulate Commerce were obviously not applicable to all the classes of carriers which had been made subject to regulation. But to what extent its provisions should be applied to any class was left, by those amendments, largely to construction. In Transportation Act 1920 the phrase 'carrier by railroad' seems to have been systematically employed to designate sections of the Interstate Commerce Act which apply only to carriers operating railroads. \n7\n The term was introduced by \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 434]\n\u00a0\n it in paragraph 4 in place of the word 'company' which had been used in the amendment of 1910.8 The purpose of the substitution was to make it clearer that the prohibition against compelling a carrier to short-haul its traffic was limited to railroads. The same phrase had been adopted in the federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149,  1, 2, and 3, 35 Stat. 65, 66 (Comp. St.  8657-8659).9 As used in that act, it was held in Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 \nU.S. 175, 187\n, 188 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 93, not to include independent express companies doing business over railroads. In section 15(4) of Transportation Act 1920, it should be given the same meaning. Compare United States ex rel. Cnicago, New York & Boston Refrigerator Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission ( decided May 26, 1924) \n265 U.S. 292\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 558, 68 L. Ed. --.\n Second. The American claims that the order is void, even if the limitation contained in paragraph 4 is not applicable to express companies. One contention is that the order exceeds the power conferred upon the Commission, because it is, as a matter of law, unreasonable to establish a second through route merely for the sake of securing \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 435]\n\u00a0\n competition in service. Another contention is that the order exceeds the power conferred upon the Commission because it purports to authorize the shipper to give routing instructions. The further claim is made that the American has, as a matter of law, the right to carry, over its own lines, traffic which it originates, as long as this can be done without unreasonably delaying the delivery at destination; that this right to haul its traffic to destination is property protected by the Fifth Amendment; that to authorize the shipper to give routing instructions takes this property; and that the provision for making an equitable division of the joint rate does not afford the legal compensation for the taking to which it is entitled.\n The Southeastern insists that these claims, although adequately presented in the bill of complaint, cannot be availed of in this court, because they were overruled by the District Court and the American did not take a cross-appeal. The objection is unsound. It is true that a party who does not appeal from a final decree of the trial court cannot be heard in opposition thereto when the case is brought there by the appeal of the adverse party. In other words, the appellee may not attack the decree with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary, whether what he seeks is to correct an error or to supplement the decree with respect to a matter not dealt with below. But it is likewise settled that the appellee may, without taking a cross- appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record, although his argument may involve an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it. \n10\n By the claims now in question, the American does not attack, \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 436]\n\u00a0\n in any respect, the decree entered below. \n11\n It merely asserts additional grounds why the decree should be affirmed. These grounds will be examined.\n The competitive route ordered must, of course, be reasonable in character from the standpoint of transportation; and there must be reasonable cause for establishing it. In this case, no objection is made to the character of the routest ordered. The objection is that, as a matter of law, the competitive routes cannot be justified because the time required for delivery over the existing routes of the American is as short as it would be under the competitive joint routes. To this objection the action taken by Congress supplies an answer. Under the act of 1906, the Commission could act only if no 'reasonable and satisfactory through route exists.' In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., \n216 U.S. 538\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 417, this court set aside an order to establish a second through route because it deemed the existing one adequate. Thereupon, Congress, by the amendment of 1910, struck out the proviso and empowered the Commission to establish through routes 'whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest.' In transportation, the quality of the service furnished may be as important to the shipper as the rate. The Commission found, in the proceeding under review, that the service of the American, in some instances, had been inadequate, and that, in 'considering competition, time is not the only important element. Conpetition tends to make each company improve its general treatment of the public, its practices, \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 437]\n\u00a0\n rules and regulations in regard to its methods of doing business.' It found, also, that the 'service at common points has improved since the formation of the Southeastern.' Its conclusion, that the establishment of the competitive routes was necessary and desirable in the public interest, is not shown to have been unreasonable.\n The existence of a competitive route ordinarily implies an option in the shipper. To give him the privilege of directing the routing is a corollary of the establishment of competitive routes. Upon shippers of railroad freight this right was expressly conferred by Congress, in paragraph 8 of section 15, subject only 'to such reasonable exceptions and regulations' as the Commission may prescribe. The rights, in this respect, of shippers by express, were not dealt with in terms. The matter was, therefore, left subject to regulation by the Commission under general provisions of the act. Paragraph 3, which empowers the Commission to establish through routes, authorizes it, also, to fix 'the terms and conditions under which such through routes shall be operated.' Its order that the shipper by express may direct the routing is not unreasonable. \n12\n As the American has no absolute right to retain traffic which it originates, and as the provision authorizing the shipper to direct the routing is reasonable, \n\n[265 U.S. 425, 438]\n\u00a0\n the order does not violate late any of its constitutional rights. We have no occasion to consider any of the other grounds urged in its support.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Commission found 'that it is necessary and desirable in the public interest that additional reasonable direct through routes and joint rates shall be maintained between points on the lines of the American Railway Express Company and points on the lines of the Southeastern Express Company, regardless of the fact that one company may have a reasonable direct single-line route, or join in a reasonable direct joint route via another junction which allows it a longer haul; that the rates between any two points shall be the same regardless of the route over which the shipment may move or the number of lines over which it may travel; that joint through routes shall be established, in instances where they will result in reasonable direct routes, so that there will be at least two reasonable direct routes between such points, one of which shall be via the transfer point selected by the Southeastern Express Company, and the other via the transfer point selected by the American Railway Express Company; and that the tariffs shall provide for the right of the shipper to designate the routing of express shipments over the routes established. ...' See 78 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 126, 143.\n The order (81 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 247) required the companies to establish, on or before October 20, 1923, through routes between all points in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York, N. Y., and all points on the direct routes of the American Railway Express Company between New York and Washington, D. C., on the one hand, and all points on the main line of the Southern Railway Company from Washington to and including Birmingham, Ala., on the other, with transfer between the companies at Washington, D. C.; that the rates between these points shall not exceed the rates contemporaneously in effect between the same points over the routes now used; and that the tariffs should provide for the right of the shipper to designate in writing the routing of shipments over the routes prescribed. No order was made fixing divisions of the joint rates. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The opinion stated that the injunction would be 'without prejudice to the right of the Commission to inquire whether, because the existing routes are unreasonably long, or for other cause particularly appearing, any of the proposed new routes can be established consistently with paragraph 4 of section 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act, and, if so, to order their establishment.' American Ry. Express Co. v. United States (D. C.) 293 Fed. 31, 38. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Act to Regulate Commerce of February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379 (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.) did not confer upon the Commission any power to establish through routes. Compare Southern Pacific v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 \nU.S. 536, 553\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 330. The amendment by Act June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  4, 34 State. 584, 590 (Comp. St.  8583), conferred power to do so 'when that may be necessary to give effect to any provision of this act, and the carriers complained of have refused or neglected to voluntarily establish such through routes and joint rates, provided no reasonable or satisfactory through route exists.' The amendment byAct June 18, 1910, c. 309,  12, 36 Stat. 539, 552, struck out the proviso and substituted therefor the limitation now reenacted in paragraph 4 of section 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by Transportation Act 1920. The latter act struck out, also, the clause in the act of 1910 by which the Commission's power to establish the through routes was dependent upon failure of the carriers to establish them voluntarily.\n Section 1, par. 3, provides that 'the term 'common carrier' as used in this act shall include all pipe-line companies; telegraph, telephone, and cable companies operating by wire or wireless; express companies; sleeping car companies,' etc. Section 1, par. 4, imposes upon every carrier of property the duty to establish through routes. Section 15, par. 1 (which deals, among other \n things, with joint rates), confers the regulatory powers in respect to 'any common carrier or carriers subject to the provisions of this act for the transportation of persons or property or for the transmission of messages ... as defined in the first section of this act.' Paragraph 2, of section 15, deals only with the time when the orders under paragraph 1 takes effect. Paragraph 3 contains no words limiting the scope of the Commission's power to establish through routes to 'carriers by railroad.' The limitation imposed, as applied to 'carriers by railroad,' appears first in paragraph 4. Prior to Transportation Act 1920, the existence of the unrestricted power to establish through routes and joint rates appears to have been assumed without question by the Commission in In re Express Rates, etc., 24 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 380, 392-394; Id., 28 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 131, 136. Compare American Express Co. v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 522, 531\n, 534 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 315. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In 1911 there were 13 express companies, of which the 10 important ones conducted their service over 218,013 miles of railway, 18,385 miles of steamship and stage lines, and 6,655 miles of electric lines.

See sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20. Compare section 22. The Commission held in In re Express Cos., 1 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 349, that, while express business conducted as a department of the business of a railroad was subject to the original act, such business when conducted by an independent company, which had acquired rights by contract with the railroad, was not subject to the act. Nor is the term 'carrier by railroad' found in the amendments of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 855, c. 382; of February 10, 1891, 26 Stat. 743, c. 128, or of February 19, 1903, 32 Stat. 847, c. 708. In the amendment of 1906, it appears in section 2 (34 Stat. p. 586); and in the amendment of 1910, it appears in sections 8 and 9 (36 Stat. p. 548). But in connection with the establishment of through routes, the use of the term 'carrier by railroad' appears for the first time in the amendment made by Trans-portation Act 1920. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] See following provisions of Interstate Commerce Act as amended by Transportation Act 1920, title 4 (Comp.

Com. Com. Rep. 200, 647. The order purports to be made in pursuance of the Act of August 18, 1922, c. 280; 42 Stat. 827 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8595). This Act amended section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act by adding to what became (1) two paragraphs, viz.: (2) directing the Commission to require the railroads subject to the Act, with such exemptions as the Commission holds justified, to issue interchangeable mileage scrip coupon tickets at just and reasonable rates, in such denominations as the Commission may prescribe, with regulations as to use and prescribing whether the tickets are transferable or not transferable and if the latter what identification may be required, and what bagage privileges go with such tickets; (3) making it a misdemeanor for any carrier to refuse to issue or accept such ticket \n\n[263 U.S. 603, 609]\n\u00a0\n as required or to conform to the Commission's rules, or for any person wilfully to offer for sale or carriage any such tickets contrary to such rules. After a hearing the Commission ordered the railroads specified, being all the railroads having annual operating revenues in excess of $1, 000,000 and known as Class 1, to issue, at designated offices, a non- transferable interchangeable scrip coupon ticket in the denomination of $ 90, which shall be sold at a reduction of 20 per cent. from the face value of the ticket.\n The bill alleges that the amendment of 1922 as construed by the Commission is contrary to the Fifth Amendment and to the Commerce clause, article 1, section 8, of the Constitution, but that properly construed it does not authorize the order made. The order is alleged to apply to intrastate carriage and also to be inconsistent with section 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8564) which requires like charges for like service in similar circumstances; with section 3 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8565) forbidding unreasonable preferences; with section 15a (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8583a) providing for the establishing of rates for rate groups that will earn a fair return upon the aggregate value of the property used in transportation (see Increased Rates, 1920, cited as Ex parte 74, 58 Interst. Com. Com. Rep. 250; Reduced Rates, 1922, 68 Interst. Com. Com. Rep. 676); and with sections 1 and 22 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563, 8595) requiring the Commission to establish just and reasonable fares. These averments are developed in detail, but we do not dwell upon them because the decision below and our own turn upon a different point. It is further alleged in the bill that the conclusion stated by the Commission that the reduced rates established by it for scrip coupon tickets will be just and reasonable for that class of travel is contrary to the specific facts found by the Commission, and is not to be taken as an independent finding of fact, but only as a conclusion or ruling reached by it upon a misinterpretation of the law. This was the view taken by the three judges who sat in the District Court. They \n\n[263 U.S. 603, 610]\n\u00a0\n held that the Commission considered that the amendment of 1922 either required it to make a reduction or at least showed a spirit and purpose that should be deferred to, and on that ground came to a result that otherwise would not have been reached. They held that therefore the order could not stand, considering that the amendment of 1922 like the rest of the Interstate Commerce Act called for an unbiased opinion upon the merits of the case. They issued a perpetual injunction and the defendants appealed. 288 Fed. 951.\n We are of opinion that the interpretation of the statute in the court below was right. There is no doubt that the bill owed its origin to a movement on the part of travelling salesmen and others to obtain interchangeable mileage or scrip coupon books at reduced rates. The bill that was passed originally fixed reduced rates, but it was amended to its present form undoubtedly because the prevailing opinion was that the rates should be determined in the usual way by the usual body. The object of the travelling salesmen was defeated in so far as Congress declined to take any step beyond authorizing the issue of scrip tickets. Coming as it did from the agitation for this form of reduced fares, the statute naturally enough carried with it more or less mirage of fulfilling the hope that gave it rise, but in fact it required a determination of what was just and reasonable exactly as in any other case arising under the Interstate Commerce Act. The original purpose of the amendment as introduced retained headway enough to require the issue of scrip, but there the purpose was stopped, and, as not infrequently happens in legislation, the matter was left otherwise where it was before. Apart from constitutional difficulties, Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co. v. Smith, \n173 U.S. 684\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 565, the whole tendency of the law has been adverse to the enactment as proposed at least unless a clear case should be made out. \n\n[263 U.S. 603, 611]\n\u00a0\n The Commission in its report pointed out that the net railway operating income for the seven months ending July 31, 1922, was below the return fixed as reasonable, discarded the supposed analogy between the carload rate and the interchangeable scrip or mileage ticket, intimated that the supposed benefit that the carrier might get from the advance use of the money would be more than offset by the increased expenses, and said that the question whether the scrip ticket would stimulate travel sufficiently to meet any loss that might result must remain a matter of speculation until an experiment was made. After thus excluding the grounds upon which the order could be justified the Commission held that the obvious spirit and apparent purpose of the law required that the experiment should be tried, and on these premises declared that the rates resulting from the reduction of 20 per cent. would be 'just and reasonable for this class of travel.' It seems to us plain that the Commission was not prepared to make its order on independent grounds apart from the deference naturally paid to the supposed wishes of Congress. But we think that it erred in reading the wishes that originated the statute as an effective term of the statute that was passed, and therefore that the present order cannot stand.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

It averred that nevertheless it was pure cider vinegar and denied adulteration and misbranding. A jury was waived, and the case was submitted on the pleadings and an agreed statement of facts.

Ed. --.\n The question for decision is whether the vinegar was misbranded. \n\n[265 U.S. 438, 440]\n\u00a0\n The substance of the agreed statement of facts may be set forth briefly. Claimant is engaged in the manufacture of food products from evaporated and unevaporated apples. During the apple season, from about September 25 to December 15, it makes apple cider and apple cider vinegar from fresh or unevaporated apples. During the balance of the year, it makes products which it designates as 'apple cider' and 'apple cider vinegar' from evaporated apples. The most approved process for dehydrating apples is used, and, in applying it, small quantities of sulphur fumes are employed to prevent rot, fermentation, and consequent discoloration. The principal result of dehydration is the removal of about 80 per cent. of the water. Whether, and to what extent, any other constituents of the apple are removed is not beyond controversy; in the present state of chemical science, no accepted test or method of analysis is provided for the making of such determination. Only mature fruit, free from rot and ferment, can be used economically and advantageously.\n In manufacturing, claimant places in a receptacle a quantity of evaporated apples to which an amount of pure water substantially equivalent to that removed in the evaporating process has been added. A heavy weight is placed on top of the apples and a stream of water is introduced at the top of the receptacle through a pipe and is applied until the liquid, released through a vent at the bottom, has carried off in solution such of the constituents of the evaporated apples as are soluble in cold water and useful in the manufacture of vinegar. Such liquid, which is substantially equivalent in quantity to that which would have been obtained had unevaporated apples been used, carries a small and entirely harmless quantity of sulphur dioxide, which is removed during the process of fining and filtration by the addition of barium carbonate or some other proper chemical agent. The liquid is then subjected to alcoholic and subsequent \n\n[265 U.S. 438, 441]\n\u00a0\n acetic fermentation in the same manner as that followed by the manufacturer of apple cider vinegar made from the liquid content of unevaporated apples. Claimant employs the same receptacles, equipment and process of manufacturing for evaporated as for unevaporated apples, except that, in the case of evaporated apples, pure water is added as above described, and in the process of fining and filtration an additional chemical is used to precipitate any sulphur compounds present and resulting from dehydration.\n The resulting liquid, upon chemical analysis, gives results similar to those obtained from an analysis of apple cider made from unevaporated apples, except that it contains a trace of barium incident to the process of manufacture. Vinegar so made is similar in taste and in composition to the vinegar made from unevaporated apples, except that the vinegar made from evaporated apples contains a trace of barium incident to the process of manufacture. There is no claim by libelant that this trace of barium renders it deleterious or injurious to health. It was conceded that the vinegar involved in these proceedings was vinegar made from dried or evaporated apples by substantially the process above described. There is no claim by the libelant that the vinegar was inferior to that made from fresh or unevaporated apples.\n Since 1906, claimant has sold throughout the United States its product manufactured from unevaporated as well as from evaporated apples as 'apple cider' and 'apple cider vinegar,' selling its vinegar under the brand above quoted, or under the brand 'Sun Bright brand apple cider vinegar made from selected apples.' Its output of vinegar is about 100,000 barrels a year. Before and since the passage of the Food and Drugs Act, vinegar in large quantities, and to a certain extent a beverage, made from evaporated apples, were sold in various parts of the United States as 'apple cider vinegar' and 'apple \n\n[265 U.S. 438, 442]\n\u00a0\n cider,'respectively, by many manufacturers. Claimant, in manufacturing and selling such products so labeled, acted in good faith. The Department of Agriculture has never sanctioned this labeling, and its attitude with reference thereto is evidenced by the definition of 'apple cider vinegar' set forth in Circulars 13, 17, 19 and 136, and Food Inspection Decision 140.1 It is stipulated that the juice of unevaporated apples when subjected to alcholic and subsequent acetous fermentation is entitled to the name 'apple cider vinegar.'\n Section 6 of the act provides that:\n'... The term 'food,' as used herein, shall include all articles used for food, drink, confectionery, or condiment by man or other animals, whether simple, mixed, or compound.'\n\n Section 8 provides:\n'That the term 'misbranded,' as used herein, shall apply to all ... articles of food, or articles which enter into the composition of food, the package or label of which shall bear any statement, design, or device regarding such article, or the ingredients or substances contained therein which shall be false or misleading in any particular. ... That for the purposes of this act an article shall also be deemed to be misbranded: ... In the case of food: First. If it be an imitation of or offered for sale under the distinctive name of another article. Second. If it be labeled or branded so as to deceive or mislead the purchaser. ... Fourth. If the package containing it or its label shall bear any statement, design, or device regarding the ingredients or the substances contained therein, which ... shall be false or misleading in any particular. ...'\n\n The statute is plain and direct. Its comprehensive terms condemn every statement, design, and device which \n\n[265 U.S. 438, 443]\n\u00a0\n may mislead or deceive. Deception may result from the use of statements not technically false or which may be literally true. The aim of the statute is to prevent that resulting from indirection and ambiguity, as well as from statements which are false. It is not difficult to choose statements, designs, and devices which will not deceive. Those which are ambiguous and liable to mislead should be read favorably to the accomplishment of the purpose of the act. The statute applies to food, and the ingredients and substances contained therein. It was enacted to enable purchasers to buy food for what it really is. United States v. Schider, \n246 \nU.S. 519, 522\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 369; United States v. Lexington Mill Co., \n232 \nU.S. 399, 409\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 337, L. R. A. 1915B, 774; United States v. Antikamnia Co., \n231 \nU.S. 654, 665\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 222, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 49.\n The vinegar made from dried apples was not the same as that which would have been produced from the apples without dehydration. The dehydration took from them about 80 per cent. of the water content-an amount in excess of two-thirds of the total of their constituent elements. The substance removed was a part of their juice from which cider and vinegar would have been made if the apples had been used in their natural state. That element was not replaced. The substance extracted from dried apples is different from the pressed out juice of apples. Samples of cider fermented and unfermented made from fresh and evaporated apples, and vinegar made from both kinds of cider were submitted to and examined by the District Judge who tried the case. He found that there were slight differences in appearance and taste, but that all had the appearance and taste of cider and vinegar. While the vinegar in question made from dried apples was like or similar to that which would have been produced by the use of fresh apples, it was not the identical product. The added water, constituting an element amounting to more than one-half of the total of all in gredients \n\n[265 U.S. 438, 444]\n\u00a0\n of the vinegar, never was a constituent element or part of the apples. The use of dried apples necessarily results in a different product.\n If an article is not the identical thing that the brand indicates it to be, it is misbranded. The vinegar in question was not the identical thing that the statement, 'Excelsior Brand Apple Cider Vinegar made from selected apples,' indicated it to be. These words are to be considered in view of the admitted facts and others of which the court may take judicial notice. The words 'Excelsior Brand,' calculated to give the impression of superiority, may be put to one side at not liable to mislead. But the words, 'apple cider vinegar made from selected apples' are misleading. Apple cider vinegar is made from apple cider. Cider is the expressed juice of apples and is so popularly and generally known. See Eureka Vinegar Co. v. Gazette Printing Co. (C. C.) 35 Fed. 570; Hildick Apple Juice Co. v. Williams (D. C.) 269 Fed. 184; Monroe Cider, Vinegar & Fruit Co. v. Riordan (C. C. A.) 280 Fed. 624, 626; Sterling Cider Co. v. Casey (D. C.) 285 Fed. 885, affirmed (C. C. A.) 294 Fed. 426. It was stipulated that the juice of unevaporated apples when subjected to alcoholic and subsequent acetous fermentation is entitled to the name 'apple cider vinegar.' The vinegar in question was not the same as if made from apples without dehydration. The name 'apple cider vinegar' included in the brand did not represent the article to be what it really was, and, in effect, did represent it to be what it was not-vinegar made from fresh or unevaporated apples. The words 'made from selected apples' indicate that the apples used were chosen with special regard to their fitness for the purpose of making apple cider vinegar. They give no hint that the vinegar was made from dried apples, or that the larger part of the moisture content of the apples was eliminated and water substituted therefor. As used \n\n[265 U.S. 438, 445]\n\u00a0\n on the label, they aid the misrepresentation made by the words 'apple cider vinegar.'\n The misrepresentation was in respect of the vinegar itself, and did not relate to the method of production merely. When considered independently of the product, the method of manufacture is not material. The act requires no disclosure concerning it. And it makes no difference whether vinegar made from dried apples is or is not inferior to apple cider vinegar.\n The label was misleading as to the vinegar, its substance and ingredients. The facts admitted sustain the charge of misbranding.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The definition referred to is: 'Vinegar, cider vinegar, apple vinegar, is the product made by the alcoholic and subsequent acetous fermentations of the juice of apples. ...' \n\n\n\n\n","202":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. PAYNE(1924)\nNo. 240\nArgued: February 25, 1924Decided: April 7, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[264 U.S. 446, 447]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. H. L. Underwood, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. Arthur E. Griffin, of Seattle, Wash., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee, an Indian of the Quillehute tribe, brought suit in the federal District Court for the Western District of Washington to determine his right to an allotment of an 80-acre tract of land in the Quinaielt Indian Reservation in that state. Authority for bringing the suit is found in 28 Stat. 305, c. 290, as amended by 31 Stat. 760, c. 217 (Comp. St.  4214, 4215). The treaty with the Quillehute and other Indians, made in 1855, among other things, provides for the removal and settlement of these Indians upon a reservation to be selected for them by the President, and for the payment by the United States of $2,500 'to clear, fence, and break up a sufficient quantity of land for cultivation.' 12 Stat. 971, arts. 2 and 5. The President is authorized by article 6 of the treaty, at his discretion, to cause the reserved lands to be surveyed and assign the same to individual Indians or families for permanent homes on the same terms and under the same conditions as are provided in article 6 of the treaty with the Omahas, concluded in 1854. 10 Stat. 1043, 1044. By the General Allotment Act, as amended, it is provided:\n'In all cases where any tribe or band of Indians has been or shall hereafter be located upon any reservation created for their use by treaty stipulation, act of Congress, or executive order, the President shall be authorized to cause the same or any part thereof to be surveyed or resurveyed whenever in his opinion such reservation or any part thereof may be advantageously utilized for agricultural or grazing purposes by such Indians, and the \n\n[264 U.S. 446, 448]\n\u00a0\n cause allotment to each Indian located thereon to be made in such areas as in his opinion may be for their best interest not to exceed eighty acres of agricultural or one hundred and sixty acres of grazing land to any one Indian. ...' 24 Stat. 388, c. 119, as amended by 26 Stat. 794, c. 383, and 36 Stat. 859, 860, c. 431 (Comp. St.  4195).\n\n The land in question was selected by Payne in 1911, after survey, through and with the approval of an allotting agent of the United States. It is of mixed character, 40 or 50 acres being timbered, and the remainder being bottom land, lying along the Raft river.\n The sole question we are called upon to decide is whether the land, being timbered, is to be excluded from the operation of the Allotment Act which speaks only of agricultural and grazing lands. Both courts below determined the question in the negative (284 Fed. 827), and we agree with them. The treaty makes no restriction in respect of the character of the land to be 'assigned,' and while the Allotment Act, being later, must control in case of conflict, it should be harmonized with the letter and spirit of the treaty, so far as that reasonably can be done, since an intention to alter, and pro tanto abrogate, the treaty, is not to be lightly attributed to Congress. These Indians yielded whatever claims they may have had to a valuable and extensive area in exchange for a relatively small reservation, relying upon what they undoubtedly understood to be an assurance on the part of the general government that they would be given individual and permanent homes therein. They are an unlettered people, unskilled in the use of language (Jones v. Meehan, \n175 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 11 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 1, 44 L. ed. 49), with regard to whom the United States occupies the position and assumes the responsibilities of virtual guardianship, bound by every moral and equitable consideration to discharge its trust with good faith and fairness (Choctaw Nation v. United States, \n119 \nU.S. 1, 28\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 75). Construing the treaty liberally in \n\n[264 U.S. 446, 449]\n\u00a0\n favor of the rights claimed under it, as we are bound to do (Hauenstein v. Lynham, \n100 U.S. 483\n, 487), we conclude that the character of the lands thereafter to be set apart for them severally was not restricted. The authority of the President is, broadly, to assign 'lands,' and that it was not meant to exclude timber lands is borne out by the provision for a payment 'to clear, fence and break up a sufficient quantity of land for cultivation,' which may well mean to 'clear' it of timber. It follows that, if the Allotment Act is now construed to exclude such lands from allotment, a materially restrictive change will have been wrought in the terms of the treaty. Such a construction is to be avoided, if possible. Chew Heong v. United States, \n112 \nU.S. 536, 541\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 255.\n It is common knowledge that vast bodies of land, originally covered with timber, in some of the public land states, including eastern Washington, have been acquired by private entry, cleared and brought under cultivation. The view that such lands were open to entry for agricultural purposes seems to have been generally recognized and acted upon (see Johnson v. Bridal Veil Lumbering Co., 24 Or. 182, 184-186, 33 Pac. 528) and, so far as we are advised, has never been questioned by the Land Department of the United States. We are therefore constrained to reject the rigidly literal interpretation of the Allotment Act for which the government here contends. It is not an unreasonable view of the requirement that an allotment shall not 'exceed eighty acres of agricultural or one hundred and sixty acres of grazing land' to say that it was meant, not to preclude an allotment of timbered lands, capable of being cleared and cultivated, but simply to differentiate, in the matter of area, between lands which may be adapted to agricultural uses and lands valuable only for grazing purposes.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","203":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED LEATHER WORKERS v. HERKERT(1924)\nNo. 233\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 457, 458]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John P. Leahy, of St. Louis, Mo., for appellants.\n Messrs. Charles A. Houts and Mat J. Holland, both of St. Louis, Mo., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was begun by a bill in equity filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri by the Herkert & Meisel Trunk Company and four others, all corporations of Missouri, engaged in making trunks and leather goods in St. Louis, against the United Leather Workers' Union, Local Lodge No. 66, an unincorporated association, its officers and agents, and a number of its members. The bill averred that each of the complainants had built up a valuable business in making, selling, and shipping in interstate commerce trunks and leather goods; that each received large quantities of raw material by interstate commerce, and employed a large \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 462]\n\u00a0\n number of persons, men and girls; that on February 28, 1920, defendants demanded that their shops be unionized and conducted as closed shops, and announced that if complainants refused they would ruin the interstate commerce business of each of them; that on April 10, 1920, the defendants acting individually and on behalf of the defendant union, in order to destroy the complainants' business and to prevent their employees from continuing in their employment, unless complainants would yield to their demands, began a strike, assaulted and threatened complainants' employees, and intimidated them so as to force them against their wills to quit complainants' employment; and that they thereby prevented complainants from engaging in and carrying on their interstate business and interfered and obstructed them in manufacture and shipment of the products of their factories sold to be shipped in interstate commerce. The bill charged that defendants were carrying out their illegal conspiracy and purposes by mass picketing and intimidation; that the interference with complainants' interstate commerce was intentional and malicious, and was intended to destroy it; that it was in violation of the Anti-Trust Law (Comp. St.  8820 et seq.) and the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730); and that they had already inflicted, and unless restrained would continue to inflict, irreparable injury upon such business. The bill shows that each complainant's damage threatened exceeded $3,000. The prayer was for a temporary and then a final injunction to prevent the intimidation, illegal picketing and other interference with complainants' manufacturing and interstate business and with its employees or would-be employees engaged in carrying it on.\n Certain of the defendants answered the bill and denied the picketing, intimidation, and violence and the purpose to interfere with complainants' interstate business as charged, and averred that they and the fellow members of the union had lawfully quit the employment of complainants \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 463]\n\u00a0\n because they could not agree upon the terms of a new agreement. The District Court upon preliminary hearing granted a temporary injunction and upon final hearing granted a final decree enjoining defendants as prayed. The case was taken on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the decree of the District Court was affirmed, one judge dissenting. 284 Fed. 446. The cause now comes before us on appeal under section 241.\n The evidence adduced before the District Court showed that the defendant, the Local Union No. 66 of the United Leather Workers, having declared a strike against the complainants and withdrawn its members from their employ, instituted an illegal picketing campaign of intimidation against their employees who were willing to remain and against others willing to take the places of the striking employees, that the effect of this campaign was to prevent the complainants from continuing to manufacture their goods needed to fill the orders they had received from regular customers and would-be purchasers in other states, that such orders covered 90 per cent. of all goods manufactured by complainants, that the character of their business was known to the defendants, and that the illegal strike campaign of defendants thus interfered with and obstructed complainants' interstate commerce business to their great loss. There was no evidence whatever to show that complainants were obstructed by the strike or the strikers in shipping to other states the products they had ready to ship or in their receipt of materials from other states needed to make their goods. While the bill averred that defendants had instituted a boycott against complainants and were prosecuting the same by illegal methods, there was no evidence whatever that any attempt was made to boycott the sale of the complainants' products in other states or anywhere, or to interfere with its interstate shipments of goods ready to ship. \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 464]\n\u00a0\n The sole question here is whether a strike against manufacturers by their employees, in tended by the strikers to provent, through illegal picketing and intimidation, continued manufacture, and having such effect, was a conspiracy to restrain interstate commerce under the Anti-Trust Act, because such products when made were, to the knowledge of the strikers, to be shipped in interstate commerce to fill orders given and accepted by would-be purchasers in other states, in the absence of evidence that the strikers interfered or attempted in interfere with the free transport and delivery of the products when manufactured from the factories to their destination in other states, or with their sale in those states.\n We think that this question was already been answered in the negative by this court. In United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., \n259 U.S. 344\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 570, 27 A. L. R. 762, a coal-mining company in Arkansas changed its arrangement with its employees from a closed shop to an open shop. The local union resented the change and the avowed purpose of the company to protect nonunion employees by armed guards. Violence, murder, and arson were resorted to by the union. Seventy-five per cent. of the output of the mine was to be shipped out of the state and a car of coal prepared for interstate shipment was destroyed by the mob of strikers and their sympathizers. It was contended that as the result of the conspiracy was to reduce the interstate shipment of coal from the mines by 5,000 tons or more a week, this conspiracy was directed against interstate commerce, and triple damages for the injury inflicted could be recovered under the federal Anti-Trust Law. But this court held otherwise and reversed a judgment for a large amount on the ground that the evidence did not disclose a conspiracy against interstate commerce, justifying recovery under the law. The language of the court was (page 407 [42 Sup. Ct. 570, 582]): \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 465]\n\u00a0\n 'Coal mining is not interstate commerce, and the power of Congress does not extend to its regulation as such. In Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 U.S. 251\n, 272, we said: 'The making of goods and the mining of coal are not commerce, nor does the fact that these things are to be afterwards shipped or used in interstate commerce, make their production a part thereof. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co. v. Yurkonis, \n238 U.S. 439\n.' Obstruction to coal mining is not a direct obstruction to interstate commerce in coal, although it, of course, may affect it by reducting the amount of coal to be carried in that commerce.'\n The same rule was followed in Gable v. Tonnegut Machinery Co. (C. C. A.) 274 Fed. 66, 73, 74.\n The same general principles are affirmed in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245, 259\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 83; Crescent Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n257 \nU.S. 129, 136\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 42; Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis, S. W. Ry. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 151\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 237; McCluskey, Adm'r, v. Marysville Ry. Co., \n243 \nU.S. 36, 38\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 374; Diamond Glue Co. v. U. S. Glue Co., \n187 \nU.S. 611, 616\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 206; Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, \n183 \nU.S. 238, 245\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 120; United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 13 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 249; Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 21 S., 9 Sup. Ct. 6; Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517, 528\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 475.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals seems first to have based its conclusion on cases like Rearick v. Pennsylvania, \n203 U.S. 507\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 159, Caldwell v. North Carolina, \n187 U.S. 622\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 229, Brennan v. Titusville, \n153 U.S. 289\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 829, and Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489, 497\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 592. These dealt directly with the sale of goods in interstate commerce. They were cases of state taxation upon the solicitation and acceptance of orders of goods to be sent from one state to another. The subject-matter taxed was contracts of sale proposed or made for deliveries of goods in interstate commerce. It is a far cry from such cases to a strike to induce the employers to make better terms with their employees, when no interference with the transportation or \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 466]\n\u00a0\n future sale of the goods by the strikers is attempted or shown.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals found further justification for its conclusion in cases like Eureka Pipe Line Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 U.S. 265\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 101, United Gas Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 U.S. 277\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 105, Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 U.S. 282\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 106, and Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 U.S. 50\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 244. They present the practical conception of interstate commerce elaborated in Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 276, hereafter to be discussed, as a flowing stream created by a course of business to be protected against state invasion, but it must be a real and direct invasion and not something incidental or remove. Thus in the Pipe Line Company and Gas Company Cases, the state of West Virginia sought to tax a stream of oil and gas flowing constantly through the state and out of it. It was held that the mere power of those who directed the stream to divert it from interstate commerce, when as a course of business it was constantly interstate, with only incidental and minor diversions to intrastate commerce, did not expose to the taxing power of the state that part of the flow which crossed state lines. The burden and invasion of interstate commerce was direct. In the Bondurant Case, a Tennessee milling company bought a crop of grain in Kentucky, to be delivered on board the cars in Kentucky for shipment to Tennessee in accord with a course of business between the parties. It was held that an effort by the state of Kentucky to require a license of the Tennessee company before it could buy and ship grain from Kentucky to Tennessee was a burden on, and invasion of, interstate commerce even though the milling company might have stopped the grain in Kentucky contrary to the usual course.\n In Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., a state law of North Dakota subjected the purchase price of all grain flowing in a regular course of business from that state to the \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 467]\n\u00a0\n market in Minneapolis, Minn., to a North Dakota inspector who was required to fix the price and determine thereby the profit the buyer should make after paying the freight to Minneapolis at the market price in that city. This was held to be a direct burden and restraint upon the interstate commerce in the grain from one state to the other. It was a direct limitation on that commerce.\n None of these cases, although they all illustrate the practical conception of interstate commerce as a flowing stream from one state to another formed by a regular course of business, can properly be said to support the argument that mere intentional cutting down of manufacture or production is a direct restraint of commerce in the product intended to be shipped when ready, or to be any departure from the general rule last announced in the Coronado Case and uniformly applied in all the cases referred to above, which it followed. The effect upon interstate commerce in the four cases just cited, on the other hand, was directly burdensome and restraining.\n Then the Circuit Court of Appeals found sustaining precedent in Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 276. In that case the defendants were charged with a conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in cattle, step by step from the purchase of them on the Western plains, in the transportation of them by the railroads through to the stockyards at Chicago, their sale and distribution there, their slaughter and preparation as meats in the packing houses of that city, and their distribution and sale in the east. This court held that such a conspiracy was a violation of the federal Anti-Trust Law, because it was an intended obstruction to the flow of interstate commerce which Congress in the Anti-Trust Law intended to keep free and untrammeled. It held that the intent to monopolize and restrain the stream of interstate commerce, \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 468]\n\u00a0\n and the probability that by such methods and steps as were attempted the purpose of the conspiracy could be effected, brought the whole machinery of the conspiracy within the federal jurisdiction. The case rested wholly on the probably effective intent of the conspirators directed against interstate commerce.\n The case of Addyston Pipe Co. v. United States, \n175 U.S. 211\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 96, was an agreement between those who made and sold iron pipe in different states to fix prices as between themselves and not sell and deliver pipe from their foundries across state lines in competition with each other. Their intent and ability to control prices and prevent the public from having the benefit of competition in interstate trade brought them within the federal Anti-Trust Act.\n So in the case of Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 U.S. 38\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 307, manufacturers of Eastern states in tiles and grates agreed with manufacturers and dealers in California not to sell tiles and grates to local dealers who would not agree to keep up prices. The intent to control commerce between the Eastern states and local dealers in California and thus to maintain prices was held to constitute a conspiracy in restraint of interstate commerce.\n On the other hand, Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 40, Anderson v. United States, \n171 U.S. 604\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 50, and United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 U.S. 1\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 249, were held not to come within the federal Anti-Trust Law because the facts of those cases were not thought to reveal the probably effective intent directly to compass the restraint on interstate commerce.\n The Knight Case has been looked upon by many as qualified by subsequent decisions of this court. The case is to be sustained only by the view that there was no proof of steps to be taken with intent to monopolize or restrain interstate commerce in sugar, but only proof of the acquisition of stock in sugar manufacturing companies to \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 469]\n\u00a0\n control its making. As intimated in the Swift Case, \n196 U.S. 397\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 276, the Knight Case was very near the line. See, also, the distinction pointed out by the Circuit Court of Appeals in Pennsylvania Sugar R. Co. v. American Sugar Refining Company, 166 Fed. 254, 256, between that case and the Knight Case. The Knight Case emphasizes the difference between manufacture and interstate commerce. But the Knight Case was a far stronger case for federal jurisdiction under the Anti-Trust Law because of the probable relation between the monopoly of manufacture and sale in interstate commerce, than the case at bar, in which there is present no element of intended and probable monopoly or discrimination in interstate commerce. The same element was lacking in the Coronado Case.\n In Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 U.S. 274\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815, and in Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 U.S. 443\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196, members of labor unions having a controversy with their employers sought to embarrass the sales by their employers of the product of their manufacture in other states by boycott and otherwise. They were held guilty of a conspiracy against interstate commerce because of their palpable intent to achieve their purpose by direct obstruction of that commerce.\n The cases of Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 U.S. 495\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229, and Chicago Borad of Trade v. Olsen, \n262 U.S. 1\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 470, are also supposed in some way to sustain the view that a strike against the manufacture of commodities intended to be shipped in interstate commerce is a conspiracy against that commerce. What those cases decided was that when Congress found from investigation that more or less constant abusive practices and a course of business, usually only within state police cognizance, threatened to obstruct or unduly to burden the freedom of interstate commerce, it could by law institute supervision of such course of business in order to prevent the abuses having such effect. As said in Stafford v. Wallace ( page 520 [42 Sup. Ct. 397, 403]): \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 470]\n\u00a0\n 'The reasonable fear by Congress that such acts, usually lawful and affecting only intrastate commerce when considered alone, will probably and more or less constantly be used in conspiracies against interstate commerce or constitute a direct and undue burden on it, expressed in this remedial legislation, serves the same purpose as the intent charged in the Swift indictment to bring acts of a similar character into the current of interstate commerce for federal restraint.'\n In United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 543\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 141, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 325, running a corner in the available supply of a staple commodity, normally the subject of interstate commerce, in order to enhance its price artificially in the whole country, although the corner was carried on only in New York by sale of cotton futures, was held to be a monopoly of interstate commerce in violation of the federal Anti- Trust Act. It was the intent to monopolize such commerce and its probability of success which sustained the indictment.\n In the Coronado Case, supra (page 410 [42 Sup. Ct. 570, 583]), this court referred to the Patten Case and the difference between that and the Coronado Case, as follows:\n'The difference between the Patten Case and that of Ware & Leland v. Mobile County, \n209 U.S. 405\n, illustrates a distinction to be drawn in cases which do not involve interstate commerce intrinsically but which may or may not be regarded as affecting interstate commerce so directly as to be within the federal regulatory power. In the Ware & Leland Case, the question was whether a state could tax the business of a broker dealing in contracts for the future delivery of cotton where there was no obligation to ship from one state to another. The tax was sustained and dealing in cotton futures was held not to be interstate commerce, and yet thereafter such dealings in cotton futures as were alleged in the Patten Case, where they were part of a conspiracy to bring the entire cotton trade within its influence, were held to be in restraint of \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 471]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce. And so in the case at bar, coal mining is not interstate commerce and obstruction of coal mining, though it may prevent coal from going into interstate commerce, is not a restraint of that commerce unless the obstruction to mining is intended to restrain commerce in it or has necessarily such a direct, material and substantial effect to restrain it that the intent reasonably must be inferred.'\n\n This review of the cases makes it clear that the mere reduction in the supply of an article to be shipped in interstate commerce by the illegal or tortious prevention of its manufacture is ordinarily an indirect and remote obstruction to that commerce. It is only when the intent or the necessary effect upon such commerce in the article is to enable those preventing the manufacture to monopolize its supply or control its price, or discriminate as between its would-be purchasers, that the unlawful interference with its manufacture can be said directly to burden interstate commerce.\n The record is entirely without evidence or circumstances to show that the defendants in their conspiracy to deprive the complainants of their workers were thus directing their scheme against interstate commerce. It is true that they were, in this labor controversy, hoping that the loss of business in selling goods would furnish a motive to the complainants to yield to demands in respect to the terms of employment; but they did nothing which in any way directly interfered with the interstate transportation or sales of the complainants' product.\n We concur with the dissenting judge in the Circuit Court of Appeals when, in speaking of the conclusion of the majority, he said:\n'The natural, logical and inevitable result will be that every strike in any industry or even in any single factory will be within the Sherman Act and subject to federal jurisdiction provided any appreciable amount of its product enters into interstate commerce.' 284 Fed. 446, 464. \n\n[265 U.S. 457, 472]\n\u00a0\n We cannot think that Congress intended any such result in the enactment of the Anti-Trust Act or that the decisions of this court warrant such construction.\n\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \n\n\n\n","204":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. THE THEKLA(1924)\nNo. 258\nArgued: November 20, 1924Decided: December 1, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 328, 329]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for Steamship Co.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 328, 334]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles S. Haight and John W. Griffin, both of New York City, for the Thekla.\n\n\n[266 U.S. 328, 338]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here upon a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, stating more at length the following facts. The Luckenbach Steamship Company on behalf of itself and the other owners libelled the barque Thekla in admiralty for a collision with the steamship F. J. Luckenbach. The owners of the Thekla moved under the old fifty-third admiralty rule for a stay until the libellant should give security to respond in damages as claimed in the cross libel, and filed a claim, stipulation for value, an answer and a cross bill against the steamer. On October 7, 1918, the motion was granted and the libel and cross libel were consolidated and proceeded as one cause. On June 4, 1919, the United States was made a party libellant upon its motion and stood on the Steamship Company's libel. It filed a claim 'without submitting itself to the jurisdiction' of the Court, alleging possession and ownership at the time when the libel was filed. Thereupon a stipulation executed by the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation was filed, which recited that the F. J. Luckenbach was under requisition charter to, and in the possession of the United States, claimant, at the time of the collision; that the liability, if any, was \n\n[266 U.S. 328, 339]\n\u00a0\n that of the United States, acting through the Corporation, the operator of it; and that the Corporation agreed in case of default on the part of the claimant that execution should issue against its chattels and lands in the sum of $130,000. The condition was that the claimant and Corporation should abide by all orders of the Court and pay the amount awarded by the final decree. On October 3, 1919, the Steamship Company on behalf of itself and other owners, excepted to the cross libel on the ground that the steamship being under charter to the United States the matters alleged in the cross libel were not within the jurisdiction of the Court. At the trial it appeared that the United States was owner pro hac vice, as alleged, using the vessel for war service, and that the Luckenbach alone was in fault, a finding affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. A decree was entered against the claimant and stipulator for the damages, $120,619. 71, with interest and costs.\n The first question certified is: Was the District Court empowered by law to render the decree entered? In answer the Government relies upon the proposition established by The Western Maid, \n257 \nU.S. 419\n, 42 S. Ct. 159, that the collision inflicted no legal wrong upon the Thekla, and the further proposition that generally speaking a claim that would not constitute a cause of action against the sovereign cannot be asserted as a counterclaim, Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. State Public Utilities Commission of Illinois, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 504\n, 505 S., 38 S. Ct. 170; see also Nassau Smelting & Refining Works v. United States (November 17, 1924) \n266 \nU.S. 101\n, 45 S. Ct. 25, 69 L. Ed. --, and that a cross libel is governed by the same rule, Washington-Southern Navigation Co. v. Baltimore & Philadelphia Steamboat Co., \n263 \nU.S. 629\n, 44 S. Ct. 220.\n We do not qualify the foregoing decisions in any way, but nevertheless are of opinion that the District Court had power to enter a decree for damages. When the United States comes into Court to assert a claim it so \n\n[266 U.S. 328, 340]\n\u00a0\n far takes the position of a private suitor as to agree by implication that justice may be done with regard to the subject matter. The absence of legal liability in a case where but for its sovereignty it would be liable does not destroy the justice of the claim against it. When the question concerns what would be paramount claims against a vessel libelled by the United States were the vessel in other hands, the moral right of the claimant is recognized. The Western Maid, \n257 \nU.S. 419, 433\n, 434 S., 42 S. Ct. 159; The Siren, 7 Wall. 152; The Athol, 1 Wm. Rob. 374, 382. The doubt in this case arises not from the absence of a maritime lien, but from the fact that the counterclaim is not against the Thekla libelled by the United States but for affirmative relief against a different vessel, the F. J. Luckenbach. There certainly is a strong argument for regarding this claim as standing no better than those dealt with in the cases cited by the Government. But we are of opinion that this is to construe the submission of the United States too narrowly. A collision involves two vessels. The trial of such cases in the ordinary course is upon libel and cross libel, consolidated under authority of statute. Rev. Sts.  921 (Comp. St.  1547); The North Star, \n106 \nU.S. 17\n, 1 S. Ct. 41. If both parties were in fault the entire damage would be divided equally between them, and it could not be argued that the United States could avoid the consequences of the rule although the damage to the other vessel might bar its recovering anything. This shows that the subject matter is the collision, rather than the vessel first libelled. Bowker v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 135, 139\n, 22 S. Ct. 802. The libel in such a case is like a bill for an account, which imports an offer to pay the balance if it should turn out against the party bringing the bill. Colombian Government v. Rothschild, 1 Sim. 94, 103; Goldthwait v. Day, 149 Mass. 185, 187, 21 N. E. 359.\n The reasons that have prevailed against creating a government liability in tort do not apply to a case like \n\n[266 U.S. 328, 341]\n\u00a0\n this, and on the other hand the reasons are strong for not obstructing the application of natural justice against the Government by technical formulas when justice can be done without endangering any public interest. As has been said in other cases the question of damages to the colliding vessel necessarily arose and it is reasonable for the Court to proceed to the determination of all the questions legitimately involved, even when it results in a judgment for damages against the United States. United States v. The Nuestra Senora de Regla, \n108 \nU.S. 92\n, 2 S. Ct. 287; The Paquete Habana, \n189 \nU.S. 453, 465\n, 466 S., 23 S. Ct. 593. We gather that our conclusion accords with the opinion of the English Courts. The Newbattle, 10 P. D. 33. The Tervaete, L. R. P. D. \n\n[266 U.S. 328, 1922]\n\u00a0\n 259, 272. It is said that there is no statute by which the Government accepted this liability. It joined in the suit, and that carried with it the acceptance of whatever liability the courts may decide to be reasonably incident to that act.\n It follows from what has been said, without the need of going further, that the stipulation ordered before the United States made itself a party, is valid, and that interest and costs can be recovered from the Fleet Corporation. See Sloan Shipyards Corporation v. United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, \n258 \nU.S. 549\n, 42 S. Ct. 386.

Martin, both of Tulsa, Okl., for appellant.\n\n\n[265 U.S. 487, 489]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Geo. F. Short, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought in a District Court of the United States to enjoin the prosecution of articles of impeachment against a state officer. The plaintiff is the officer against whom the articles are directed, and the principal defendants are officers designated to conduct the prosecution before the Chief Justice and Senate of the state sitting as a court of impeachment. The allegations of the bill are very general, wanting in precision, and usually made on information and belief. In substance the grounds on which the injunction is sought are that the articles of impeachment were prompted by wrongful motives and prejudice on the part of most of the members of the House of Representatives of the state; that many members of the Senate who will sit in the court of impeachment have the same wrongful motives and prejudice, and will be controlled by them, instead of by the evidence; and that to subject the plaintiff to a trial before a body so constituted will work a denial of the due process and equal protection to which he is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In the District Court the defendants challenged the bill by a motion to dismiss, and after a hearing on that motion the court entered a decree of dismissal. The plaintiff appealed to this court.\n The trial before the court of impeachment proceeded, and the plaintiff was found guilty on some of the articles and removed from office. While the impeachment proceeding was in an early stage, its validity was sustained by the Supreme Court of the state (State v. Chambers, 220 Pac. 890), \n\n[265 U.S. 487, 490]\n\u00a0\n and after the proceeding was carried to judgment petitions for certiorari were denied by that court and by this court (\n263 U.S. 721\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 230, 68 L. Ed.--).\n We think the District Court rightly dismissed the bill. A court of equity has no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers (White v. Berry, \n171 U.S. 366\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 917); and particularly are the courts of the United States, sitting as courts of equity, without jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of state officers (In re Sawyer, \n124 \nU.S. 200, 210\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 482). And see Taylor v. Beckham, \n178 \nU.S. 548, 570\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 890, 1009. That the removal is through a proceeding in the nature of a criminal prosecution does not alter the rule.

BALTIMORE & PHILADELPHIA STEAMBOAT(1924)\nNo. 108\nArgued: Decided: January 28, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 629, 630]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.\n Arthur E. Weil, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Ralph James M. Bullowa, of New York City, for Washington-Southern Nav. Co.\n Mr. Thomas Raeburn White, of Philadelphia, Pa., for Baltimore & Philadelphia Steamboat Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Washington-Southern Navigation Company, the charterer of two steamers of the Baltimore & Philadelphia Steamboat Company, filed, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a libel in personam against the owner to recover the sum of $120,000 for breach of the charter party. The usual bond for costs was given. No attachment or seizure of the property of the respondent was made or sought. The owner traversed the essential averments of the libel and also filed a cross-libel in which it sought damages in the sum of $43,443.25. There was no attachment or seizure of person or property under the cross-libel. The essential allegations of the cross- libel were in turn denied by the charterer. Thereafter the owner moved that the charterer be required to give security to respond in damages on the counterclaim. The \n\n[263 U.S. 629, 631]\n\u00a0\n trial court ordered it to do so, provided the owner first gave security to pay the charterer's claim. 271 Fed. 540. This the owner did of his own motion and without compulsion. The charterer did not give the security ordered. Thereupon the trial court entered a decree staying all proceedings until its order should be obeyed.\n The motion and order were based on rule 50 of the new Admiralty Rules, promulgated December 6, 1920 (\n254 U.S. 24\n, appendix, 40 Sup. Ct. xix), which amends former rule 53 (\n210 U.S. 53\n, 29 Sup. Ct. xiv), by adding thereto the words italicized, so that it now reads:\n Rule 50: 'Whenever a cross-libel if filed upon any counterclaim arising out of the same contract or cause of action for which the original libel was filed, and the respondent or claimant in the original suit shall have given security to respond in damages, the respondent in the cross-libel shall give security in the usual amount and form to respond in damages to the claims set forth in said cross- libel, unless the court, for cause shown, shall otherwise direct; and all proceedings on the original libel shall be stayed, until such security be given unless the court otherwise directs.'\n The charterer appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court, under section 239 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1216), asks instruction whether this rule empowers the District Court to stay proceedings in the original suit until the original libelant shall have given security to respond to the counterclaim, in a case where the original libel was in personam and the original respondent (the cross- libelant) has given the security voluntarily; that is, of his own motion and without compulsion.\n The owner insists that the terms of rule 50 are so clear that there is no room for a construction different from that given to it by the District Court. But to ascertain the true meaning of the rule, the operation and effect of the construction urged must be considered. Under that given, \n\n[263 U.S. 629, 632]\n\u00a0\n a libelant may be automatically barred from prosecuting his suit, merely because he is unable or unwilling to give security to satisfy the claim made in the cross-libel. For, although no security is asked of the original respondent, he may, by voluntarily giving security, effect a stay of all proceedings against himself, 'unless the court, for cause shown,' directs otherwise. \n1\n Thus construed, rule 50 would abrogate the right to proceed in admiralty, and substitute therefor either a conditional right to prosecute the suit, provided libelant gives security to satisfy the counterclaim, or a permission to do so, provided the court, in its discretion, for cause shown, grants leave. Moreover, the circumstances under which alone this loss of the right to sue would occur are whimsical. The original libelant could proceed without giving the security, if the respondent, instead of filing a cross-libel, brought an independent cross- suit. Likewise, if the person who feels himself aggrieved, instead of exercising diligence in prosecuting his claim, exercises self-restraint, and allows the other party to the controversy to commence the hostilities, he may, without giving the security, exercise the right to prosecute his cause of action, either by a cross-libel or by an independent cross-action. 2 An intention to introduce a practice so capricious is not to be lightly imputed.\n To ascertain the true meaning of the rule, it must be read, also, in the light of the established admiralty jurisdiction, of the general principles of maritime law, and of the appropriate function of rules of court. Before rule \n\n[263 U.S. 629, 633]\n\u00a0\n 53 was adopted,3 the general practice in admiralty concerning the giving of security had long been settled. Every party-libelant, respondent, claimant, and intervener-was obliged, or could be required, to give security for costs. No party could be required to give security to satisfy the claim of another. In suits in personam, where the mesne process was solely by simple monition in the nature of a summons to appear and answer the suit, no security, except that for costs, was ever given by the respondent. Where the process included a clause for mesne attachment of property, the respondent was not obliged to give any security except for costs; but he could, if he chose, obtain dissolution of the attachment by giving security to pay the amount of the decree against him not exceeding the value of the attached property. Where the mesne process was by warrant of arrest of the person in the nature of a capias, the respondent was, likewise, not obliged to give security for the claim; but he could, if he chose, obtain his release by giving bail to secure his appearance and\/or to satisfy the decree. Where the suit was in rem, the claimant was under no obligation to give such security; but he could, if he chose, obtain release of the property seized by giving security for its value or for the amount required to satisfy the claims made. Thus, neither respondent, claimant nor intervener could, as a \n\n[263 U.S. 629, 634]\n\u00a0\n condition of prosecuting his claim or defense, be compelled to furnish any security other than for costs. And the libelant could never be put into a situation which obliged him to give any other security. Such was still the practice concerning the giving of security for claims prosecuted in admiralty (except as modified by rule 53) when rule 50 was incorporated in the revision of December 6, 1920.4\n The contruction given to rule 50 by the District Court would, by imposing an impossible or onerous condition, deprive many litigants of the right to prosecute their claims in admiralty. Among others, it would, if applied, generally, deny this right to seamen, upon whom, regardless of their means or nationality, Congress, shortly before the adoption of rule 50, had conferred the right to prosecute their claims, in both trial and appellate courts, without giving security even for costs. \n5\n It would likewise deny to poor citizens of the United States the right to proceed in admiralty, which Congress had by successive acts sought to ensure, in order to relieve litigants from dependence upon the judicial discretion theretofore incident to leave \n\n[263 U.S. 629, 635]\n\u00a0\n to sue in forma pauperis. \n6\n The right of a citizen of the United States to sue in a court having jurisdiction of the parties and of the cause of action includes the right to prosecute his claim to judgment. Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Adams, \n180 \nU.S. 28, 34\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 251; McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268, 281\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 501. Obviously, it was not the intention of this court in adopting the rule to disregard the right of seamen, of poor persons or of others to prosecute suits in admiralty. The function of rules is to regulate the practice of the court and to facilitate the transaction of its business. This function embraces, among other things, the regulation of the forms, operation and effect of process; and the prescribing of forms, modes and times for proceedings. Most rules are merely a formulation of the previous practice of the courts. Occasionally, a rule is employed to express, in convenient form, as applicable to certain classes of cases, a principle of substantive law which has been established by statute or decisions. But no rule of court can enlarge or restrict jurisdiction. Nor can a rule abrogate or modify the substantive law. This is true, whether the court to which the rules apply be one of law, of equity or admiralty. It is true of rules of practice prescribed by this court for inferior tribunals, as it is of those rules which \n\n[263 U.S. 629, 636]\n\u00a0\n lower courts make for their own guidance under authority conferred. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n It remains to consider the purpose of rule 50. The cross-libel, unlike the cross-bill in equity, is of recent origin. This simple device in aid of the administration of justice was not established in the English courts of admiralty until, under the name of cross-cause, it was authorized by the Admiralty Court Act of 1861, 24 and 25 Vict. c. 10,  34. Theretofore, that court considered itself without power even to compel consolidation of independent cross-suits or to stay one to await proceedings in the other. Moreover, where the original libel was filed by a nonresident resident libelant, substituted service in a cross-action, by serving his proctor, was not permitted, until this was authorized by a rule of court adopted in 1859.8 In American courts of admiralty the practice was more liberal. Set-off being of statutory origin and not expressly authorized in admiralty, was rejected here as in England. \n9\n But Congress conferred upon all federal courts, in 1813, the right to compel consolidation of causes. The \n\n[263 U.S. 629, 637]\n\u00a0\n North Star, \n106 \nU.S. 17, 27\n, 1 S. Sup. Ct. 41. Leter our admiralty courts recognized the propriety of affording affirmative relief by a cross-libel, in analogy to the cross-bill in equity. \n10\n The procedure on cross-libels and their scope remained, however, unsettled. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Rule 53 was doubtless suggested by section 34 of the English Admiralty Court Act. \n12\n By that provision, the court was authorized, in certain cases, to suspend proceedings in the original cause until security had been given to answer judgment in the 'crosscause.' \n13\n The power was in its \n\n[263 U.S. 629, 638]\n\u00a0\n terms limited to cases in which the ship of the original defendant had been arrested or he had given bail. The courts held that the act does not apply where the original libel was in personam,14 and that in actions in rem, it had, thereunder, no power to order a stay where there had been no arrest and the defendant had given bail voluntarily. \n15\n Rule 53 did not so limit the power to suits in rem; for, while process in the nature of foreign attachment in suits in personam fell into disuse in England, it had become the established practice in this country. \n16\n Neither was rule 53 in terms limited to suits where the original libelant had made an arrest or attachment. But, although it remained in force, unmodified, for more than half a century, no reported case discloses that a stay was ordered under it, except where the original respondent had been obliged to give security in order to obtain release of the ship or of attached property. \n17\n Here, as in England, the purpose of the provision was declared to be to place the parties on an \n\n[263 U.S. 629, 639]\n\u00a0\n equality as regards security. \n18\n And under it, security to satisfy the counterclaim could not be exacted by means of a stay, unless the original libelant had compelled the giving of such security to satisfy his own claim.\n The new phrases introduced in rule 50 were not designed to introduce any new practice concerning cross-libels. Their purpose was to formulate the practice which had become settled. This is true of those relating to the giving of security, as it is of those concerning the character \n\n[263 U.S. 629, 640]\n\u00a0\n of the claims which may be asserted by means of a cross-libel. \n19\n The answer to the question of the Circuit Court of Appeals is:\n No. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Compagnie Universalle du Canal, etc., v.

It was designed, where the libelants in a suit in rem, through the arrest of the property, exact and obtain security for their own demand, that in a cross-suit in personam for a counterclaim in respect to the same subject of litigation, the defendants in the former suit should likewise be entitled to security for the payment of their demands, in case the decision of the court upon the point in controversy should be in their favor. The rule was designed to correct the inequality and injustice of the process of the court in rem being used to obtain security in favor of one party, in teference to a single subject of dispute, while it was denied to the other.' \n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Compare Bowker v.

C., for respondent.\n Mr. Edwin J. Prindle, of New York City, amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ brings up for review the decree of the court below in a patent suit (Splitdorf Electrical Co. v. Webster Electric Co., 283 Fed. 83 ), reversing a decree of the federal District Court for the Northern District \n\n[264 U.S. 463, 464]\n\u00a0\n of Illinois (Webster Electric Co. v. Podlesak, 255 Fed. 907), and directing a dismissal of the bill. Three patents were involved. The decision in respect of two of them turned upon the question whether a license contract between the patentees, Henry and Emil Podlesak, and petitioner, had the effect of precluding an assignment of patent rights made by the Podlesaks to respondent. But the petition upon which the writ was granted challenged the decision below only in respect of the third patent, and we are not called upon to consider the contentions now advanced as to the others. Alice State Bank v. Houston Pasture Co., \n247 \nU.S. 240, 242\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 496\n\n\n The bill alleges that the Splitdorf Electrical Company had infringed claims 7 and 8 of Kane patent, 1,280,105, issued September 24, 1918, for a rigid unitary and integral support for mounting the various parts of an electrical ignition device. The original application was filed by Kane February 2, 1910, on which patent No. 1,204,573 was granted November 14, 1916. On October 24, 1914, Kane endeavored to amend his application by introducing six claims copied from Milton's patent, issued May 12, 1914, for the purpose of securing an interference. The amendment was refused, and Kane was directed by the Examiner to file a divisional application, if he desired to contest an interference with Milton. This was done. The Webster Company, however, acquired the rights of both Milton and Kane, and through their attorneys conducted the proceedings for both sides in the Patent Office, resulting in an award of priority in favor of Kane.\n Subsequently in 1915 Kane filed a divisional application, presenting nine additional claims, copied from Podlesak's patent No. 1,055,076, issued March 4, 1913, and reissue patent No. 13,878, dated February 9, 1915, all of which claims were ultimately decided in favor of the Podlesaks. Thereafter, on June 17, 1918, an amendment was filed embracing the new and broader claims here in question, which were allowed upon an exparte showing and, \n\n[264 U.S. 463, 465]\n\u00a0\n as already stated, patent issued September 24, 1918, to the petitioner, to whom all rights had been assigned. The original bill was filed in 1915, and claims 7 and 8 were brought into the suit by a supplemental bill filed October 25, 1918.\n It will thus be seen that claims 7 and 8 were for the first time presented to the Patent Office, by an amendment to a divisional application eight years and four months after the filing of the original application, five years after the date of the original Podlesak patent, disclosing the subject-matter, and three years after the commencement of the present suit. A comparison of these claims, as set forth in the patent, with the claims in the original application, to say the least, leaves in doubt the question whether they were not so materially enlarged as to preclude their allowance on the original application. Railway Co. v. Sayles, \n97 U.S. 554\n, 563; Hobbs v. Beach, \n180 \nU.S. 383, 396\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 409; Dunham v. Dennison Manufacturing Co., \n154 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 986; Michigan Cent. R. Co. v. Consolidated Car-Heating Co., 67 Fed. 121, 126, 14 C. C. A. 232. But this aside, the evidence establishes to our satisfaction that Kane did not originally intend to assert these amended claims, because he considered their subject-matter one merely of design and not of invention, and the inference is fully warranted that the intention to do so was not entertained prior to 1918. During all of this time their subject-matter was disclosed and in general use, and Kane and his assignee, so far as claims 7 and 8 are concerned, simply stood by and awaited developments. We are not here dealing, therefore, with the simple case of a division of a single application for several independent inventions (Patent Office rules 41 and 42; Bennett v. Fowler, 8 Wall. 445, 448; American Laundry Machinery Co. v. Prosperity Company, Inc. [D. C.] 294 Fed. 144), but with a case of unreasonable delay and neglect on the part of the applicant and his assignee in bringing forward claims broader than those \n\n[264 U.S. 463, 466]\n\u00a0\n originally sought. The repeated assertion of interferences in narrower terms, resulting in delays incident to their determination, affords no just excuse for the failure to assert the broader claims, 7 and 8, at an earlier date. The subject-matter of these claims is not of such complicated character that it might not have been readily described in the original application or in one of the subsequent applications-in 1915, for example-as it was described in 1918, and the long delay of Kane and his assignee in coming to the point tends strongly to confirm the view that the final determination to do so was an exigent afterthought, rather than a logical development of the original application. We have no hesitation in saying that the delay was unreasonable, and, under the circumstances shown by the record, constitutes laches, by which the petitioner lost whatever rights it might otherwise have been entitled to.\n We do not overlook the importance of not applying so narrowly the patent law as to discourage the inventor from exercising his creative genius, or the manufacturer or capitalist from assisting in the necessary work of bringing the invention into beneficial use; but it is no less important that the law shall not be so loosely construed and enforced as to subvert its limitations, and bring about an undue extension of the patent monopoly against private and public rights. In suits to enforce reissue patents, the settled rule of this court is that a delay for two years or more will 'invalidate the reissue, unless the delay is accounted for and excused by special circumstances, which show it to have been not unreasonable.' Wollensak v. Reiher, \n115 \nU.S. 96, 101\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 1137, 1140 (29 L. Ed. 350). In that case it appeared that the reissue patent was issued to complainant December 26, 1882, upon the surrender of the original patent of March 10, 1874. The Patent Office decided that because of special circumstances the applicant was not guilty of laches; but this court held otherwise. The claims alleged \n\n[264 U.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n to have been infringed were expansions of the original claims as embraced within the invention set forth in the original patent. This court (pages 99, 100 [5 Sup. Ct. 1139, 1140]) said:\n'It follows from this that if, at the date of the issue of the original patent, the patentee had been conscious of the nature and extent of his invention, an inspection of the patent, when issued, and an examination of its terms, made with that reasonable degree of care which is habitual to and expected of men, in the management of their own interests, in the ordinary affairs of life, would have immediately informed him that the patent had failed fully to cover the area of his invention. And this must be deemed to be notice to him of the fact, for the law imputes knowledge when opportunity and interest, combined with reasonable care, would necessarily impart it.\n\n'Not to improve such opportunity, under the stimulus of self-interest, with reasonable diligence, constitutes laches which in equity disables the party, who seeks to revive a right which he has allowed to lie unclaimed, from enforcing it to the detriment of those who have, in consequence, been led to act as though it were abandoned.\n\n'This general doctrine of equity was applied with great distinctness to the correction of alleged mistakes in patents, by reissues, in the case of Miller v. Brass Company, \n104 U.S. 350\n. It was there declared, that where the mistake suggested was merely that the claim was not as broad as it might have been, it was apparent upon the first inspection of the patent, and, if any correction was desired, it should have been applied for immediately; that the granting of a reissued for such a purpose, after an unreasonable delay, is clearly an abuse of the power to grant reissues, and may justly be declared illegal and void; that, in reference to reissues made for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the patent, the rule of laches should be strictly applied, and no one should be relieved who has \n\n[264 U.S. 463, 468]\n\u00a0\n slept upon his rights, and has thus led the public to rely on the implied disclaimer involved in the terms of the original patent; and that when this is a matter apparent on the face of the instrument, upon a mere comparison of the original patent with the reissue, it is competent for the courts to decide whether the delay was unreasonable and whether the reissue was, therefore, contrary to law and void.\n\n'This doctrine has been reiterated in many cases since, and at the present term has been reconsidered and emphatically repeated as the settled law, in the case of Mahn v. Harwood, \n112 U.S. 354\n, where it is said, by Mr. Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion of the court:\n\n'We repeat, then, if a patentee has not claimed as much as he is entitled to claim, he is bound to discover the defect in a reasonable time, or he loses all right to a reissue; and if the Commissioner of Patents, after the lapse of such reasonable time, undertakes to grant a reissue for the purpose of correcting the supposed mistake, he exceeds his power, and acts under a mistaken view of the law; and the court, seeing this, has a right, and it is its duty, to declare the reissue pro tanto void, in any suit founded upon it.' It was also there said that, while no invariable rule can be laid down as to what it reasonable time within which the patentee should seek for the correction of a claim which he considers too narrow, a delay of two years, by analogy to the law of public use before an application for a patent, should be construed equally favorable to the public, and that excuse for any longer delay than that should be made manifest by the special circumstances of the case.'\n\n In Ives v. Sargent, \n119 \nU.S. 652, 661\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 436, the duty of the patentee to examine his letters patent within a reasonable time to ascertain whether the latter fully covered his invention was reiterated. And where this was neglected for a period of three years, when, finding the real invention \n\n[264 U.S. 463, 469]\n\u00a0\n had been infringed, but without infringing the patent as originally granted, an application for a reissue was made and allowed, it was held that the patentee was guilty of laches and the reissue came too late. The doctrine of Wollensak v. Reiher was restated (page 662 [7 Sup. Ct. 441]), to the effect that, while no invariable rule can be laid down, a delay of two years, by analogy to the law of public use before an application for a patent, will be fatal, unless excuse for a longer delay shall be made manifest by the special circumstances of the case. See, also, Topliff v. Topliff and Another, \n145 U.S. 156\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 825; Wollensak v. Sargent, \n151 U.S. 221\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 291.\n While the analogy between the case of a reissue patent and that of copying for interference is not always an exact one, it is sufficiently so, as applied to the present case, to make these decisions pertinent, and the principle which they announce is controlling. We brought this case here by certiorari because of the claim that the decision of the Court of Appeals rested primarily on Chapman v. Wintroath, \n252 U.S. 126\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 234; and the contention was that the opinion there had been misunderstood and misapplied. \n1\n The question as thus presented was important, and one which it was thought should be authoritatively determined. The court below finally put its decision substantially on the ground which we have stated as the basis of our conclusion, but before doing so it said (Splitdorf Electrical Co. v. Webster Electric Co., 283 Fed. 93):\n'Appellants contend, however, and we agree with the courts that have passed upon the question, that the effect of the holding [in the Wintroath Case] is to fix the period during which such application must be filed at two years from the date of the issuance of the other patent. No other deduction can fairly or logically be drawn from the discussion of the question in that opinion.'\n\n But Chapman v. Wintroath is not to be so narrowly construed. \n\n[264 U.S. 463, 470]\n\u00a0\n The facts of the case were: The Chapmans filed their application in 1909. The invention was a complicated one and the application met with much difficulty in the Patent Office, and, though regularly prosecuted, no patent had been issued in 1915 when the controversy arose. Wintroath filed an application in 1912. His invention was also elaborate and intricate. Twenty months after this latter application, the Chapmans filed a divisional application, in which the claims of the Wintroath patent were copied and an interference was declared. The Examiner, without hearing evidence, entered judgment in favor of Wintroath on the ground that the failure of the Chapmans to present the interference issue for more than a year after the date of the Wintroath patent constituted laches, and that they were estopped. This decision was reversed by the Commissioner of Patents, and his decision, in turn, was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, that court holding that the one-year period should apply, on the ground that the divisional application was to be regarded substantially as an amendment to the parent application, and that it would be inequitable to permit a longer time than that allowed by R. S .  4894 (Comp. St.  9438), for further prosecution of an application after office action. This court, in reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals, referred to section 4886, as amended by Act March 3, 1897, c. 391, 29 Stat. 692 (Comp. St.  9430), and sections 4887, 4897, and 4920 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  9431, 9443, 9466), all of which contain provisions for a time limit of two years for filing applications, and said ( page 136 [40 Sup. Ct. 236]):\n'Thus through all of these statutes runs the time limit of two years for the filing of an application, there is no modification in any of them of the like provision in Rev. Stats.  4886, as amended, and no distinction is made between an original and a later or a divisional application, with respect to this filing right.'\n\n If this were all, it might justify the conclusion that a hard and fast time limit of two years is to be applied in \n\n[264 U.S. 463, 471]\n\u00a0\n every case of a divisional application. But a reading of the entire opinion demonstrates that this conclusion is erroneous. The court proceeds to say that divisional applications are not to be dealt with in a hostile spirit, but are to be--\n'favored to the extent that, where an invention clearly disclosed in an application ... is not claimed therein, but is subsequently claimed in another application, the original will be deemed a constructive reduction of the invention to practice and the later one will be given the filing date of the earlier, with all of its priority of right.'\n\n Reference is made to Wollensak v. Reiher, supra, and other reissue cases, which, as we have seen, adopt the two-year time limit by analogy to the law of public use before application for patent, and, while it is not said in terms, the plain import of the citation of and reliance upon these cases is that the effect of the two years' delay, as recognized in those cases, may be overcome where it 'is accounted for and excused by special circumstances which show it to have been not unreasonable,' and, properly understood, there is nothing in the opinion to the contrary.\n Our conclusion, therefore, is that in cases involving laches, equitable estoppel or intervening private or public rights, the two-year time limit prima facie applies to divisional applications and can only be avoided by proof of special circumstances justifying a longer delay. In other words, we follow in that respect the analogy furnished by the patent reissue cases.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, American Laundry Machinery Co. et al. v.

White, of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondent White.\n\n\n[265 U.S. 242, 251]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents brought separate actions to recover money which they alleged petitioner unlawfully demanded of them as income tax. The question for our decision is this: Did they, by the transactions hereinafter detailed, dispose with profit of all or, as they maintain, of only half their interests in the National Acme Manufacturing Company, within the income provisions, Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 757,  2(a), being Comp. St.  6336b(a). Both courts below upheld their claims and gave judgments for appropriate refunds.\n Under a definite written agreement the following things were done--\n (A) Respondents and other owners delivered duly indorsed certificates representing the entire capital stock ($5,000,000) of the National Acme Manufacturing Company, incorporated under laws of Ohio-the old corporation- to the Cleveland Trust Company, as depositary. Messrs. Eastman, Dillon & Co. deposited $7,500,000 with the same trust company. Representatives of both classes of depositors thereupon incorporated in Ohio the National Acme Company-the new corporation-with $25,000,000 authorized capital stock, and powers similar to those of the old corporation. Pursuing the definite purpose for which it was organized, the new corporation purchased and took over the entire property, assets, and business of the old one, assuming all outstanding contracts and liabilities, and in payment therefor issued to the trust company its entire authorized capital stock. It continued to operate the acquired business under the former management, and the old corporation was dissolved. \n\n[265 U.S. 242, 252]\n\u00a0\n (B) The trust company delivered to Eastman, Dillon & Co. certificates for half the new stock-$12,500,000. To the owners of the old stock-to each his pro rata part-it delivered certificates representing the remaining half, together with the $7,500,000 cash received from Eastman, Dillon & Co. The owner of each $100 of old stock thus received $150 cash, also $250 of new stock, representing an interest in the property and business half as large as he had before. Prior to the specified transactions his interest in the enterprise was 100\/5000000; thereafter it became 250\/25000000, or 50\/5000000.\n The collector ruled that each old stockholder sold his entire holding, and assessed respondent accordingly for resulting profits. Adopting a different view, the courts below held that he really sold half for cash and exchanged the remainder, without gain, for the same proportionate interest in the transferred corporate assets and business.\n We agree with the conclusion reached below. The practical result of the things done was a transfer of the old assets and business, without increase or diminution or material change of general purpose, to the new corporation, a disposal for cash by each stockholder of half his interest therein, and an exchange of the remainder for new stock representing the same proportionate interest in the enterprise. Without doubt every stockholder became liable for the tax upon any profits which he actually realized by receiving the cash payment. If by selling the remainder he hereafter receives a segregated profit, that also will be subject to taxation.\n Petitioner relies upon United States v. Phellis, \n257 U.S. 156\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 63, and Rockefeller v. United States, \n257 U.S. 176\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 68; also Cullinan v. Walker, \n262 U.S. 134\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 495, which followed them. As the result of transactions disclosed in the Phellis and Rockefeller Cases, certain corporate assets not exceeding accumulated surplus were segregated and passed to individual stockholders. The value of the segregated thing \n\n[265 U.S. 242, 253]\n\u00a0\n so received was held to constitute taxable income. Cullinan's gain resulted from a dividend in liquidation actually distributed in the stock of a holding company incorporated under the laws of a foreign state, not organized for the purpose of carrying on the old business, and which held no title to the original assets.\n Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 U.S. 189\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570, gave great consideration to the nature of income and stock dividends. It pointed out that, within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment, income from capital is gain severed therefrom and received by the taxpayer for his separate use; that the interest of the stockholder is a capital one, and stock certificates but evidence of it; that for purposes of taxation where a stock dividend is declared, the essential and controlling fact is that the recipient receives nothing out of the company's assets for his separate use and benefit. The conclusion was that, 'having regard to the very truth of the matter, to substance and not to form, he has received nothing that answers the definition of income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment.'\n Applying the general principles of Eisner v. Macomber, it seems clear that if the National Acme Manufacturing Company had increased its capital stock to $25,000,000, and then declared a stock dividend of 400 per cent., the stockholders would have received no gain-their proportionate interest would have remained the same as before. If upon the transfer of its entire property and business for the purpose of reorganization and future conduct the old corporation had actually received the entire issue of new stock and had then distributed this pro rata among its stockholders, their ultimate rights in the enterprise would have continued substantially as before-the capital assets would have remained unimpaired, and nothing would have gone therefrom to any stockholder for his separate benefit. The value of his holdings would not have changed, and he would have retained the same essential rights in respect of the assets. \n\n[265 U.S. 242, 254]\n\u00a0\n We cannot conclude that mere change for purposes of reorganization in the technical ownership of an enterprise, under circumstances like those here disclosed, followed by issuance of new certificates constitutes gain separated from the original capital interest. Something more is necessary- something which gives the stockholder a thing really different from what he theretofore had. Towne v. Eisner, \n245 U.S. 418\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1918D, 254; Southern Pacific Company v. Lowe, \n247 U.S. 330\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 540; Gulf Oil Corporation v. Lewellyn, \n248 U.S. 71\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 35. The sale of part of the new stock and distribution of the proceeds did not affect the nature of the unsold portion; when distributed this did not in truth represent any gain.\n Considering the entire arrangement, we think it amounted to a financial reorganization under which each old stockholder retained half of his interest and disposed of the remainder. Questions of taxation must be determined by viewing what was actually done, rather than the declared purpose of the participants, and when applying the provisions of the Sixteenth Amendment and income laws enacted thereunder we must regard matters of substance and not mere form.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissent, on the ground that the case falls within the rule declared in Cullinan v.

Hodghead, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. R. H. Johnson, of Boise, Idaho, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit against the Telegraph Company for failure to forward and deliver to the plaintiff a message from one Jones, found by the Court below to have been acting as agent for the plaintiff in the matter. The District Court found for the defendant, but the judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 272 Fed. 223, and at a second trial, in deference to the Circuit Court of Appeals, a judgment was entered for the plaintiff, which was affirmed, 286 Fed. 478. Certiorari granted. \n262 U.S. 739\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 700\n\n\n The plaintiff owned fifty shares of stock in the Idaho National Bank at Boise, Idaho. Miller, vice president of the bank, was buying the stock with a view to a merger. He talked with the plaintiff and told him that he would buy his stock and that they would have no difficulty in agreeing on the price. The plaintiff told this to Jones, an attorney at Boise, who owned fifteen shares, asked Jones to act for him, saying that they would sell their stock together, and told Miller that Jones would represent him. Later miller called on Jones and at Miller's request Jones, on November 30, 1917, wrote on a Western Union form-directing the Company to send it 'subject to the terms on \n\n[264 U.S. 281, 283]\n\u00a0\n back hereof,' the following telegram addressed to the plaintiff at 5767 Shafter Avenue, Oakland, California, where the plaintiff lived:\n'Miller advises Idaho National sold to Pacific offers me ninety dollars per share otherwise wait year and chances of liquidation says if fails to get two thirds stock liquidation will follow Will you take ninety dollars per share for yours I am inclined to accept offer for mine Answer.'\n\n The form had been filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Commission had approved the provisions and rates that it set forth. Among the terms on the back of the form were the following:\n'To guard against mistakes or delays, the sender ... should order it repeated, that is, telegraphed back to the originating office for comparison,' an additional half rate being charged. 'Unless otherwise indicated on its face, This is an unrepeated telegram and paid for as such, in consideration whereof it is agreed ... 1. The Company shall not be liable for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery, or for nondelivery, of any unrepeated telegram, beyond the amount received for sending the same. ... 2. In any event the Company shall not be liable for damages for any mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery, or for the nondelivery, of this telegram, whether caused by the negligence of its servants or otherwise, beyond the sum of fifty dollars, at which amount this telegram is hereby valued, unless a greater value is stated in writing hereon at the time the telegram is offered to the Company for transmission, and an additional sum paid or agreed to be paid based on such value equal to one-tenth of one per cent. thereof.'\n\n This telegram was an unrepeated message of the class known as night letter, and was not specially valued or paid for upon a value in excess of $ 50. It was the duty of the receiving clerk, Margaret Brown, to indorse her initials, \n\n[264 U.S. 281, 284]\n\u00a0\n the filing time and the amount of toll received, and to place the message on the sending hook for transmission. By inadvertence, although a competent clerk, she put it in a file of earlier messages instead of upon the hook, and it was not sent. The next day Jones's son inquired at the telegraph office for an answer and being told that there was none, asked if they had sent the telegram and was answered yes. On December 3 he asked again and was told that the plaintiff had received the message. Miller was ready and willing to buy the stock until December 5, 1917, and the plaintiff testified that he would have sold if he had received the telegram. Later the stock became worthless. The District Court found that there was no gross negligence but the Circuit Court of Appeals distinguished between a failure to take the first step toward transmission and some later neglect, held that the failure was not and as a matter of public policy could not be within the protection of the terms that we have stated and held the company liable for $4,500 with interest at seven per cent. from June 18, 1918, on which day the plaintiff made a demand.\n The plaintiff, the respondent here, does not deny that he is bound by the terms that we have recited. That was assumed below and is established law. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve, \n256 U.S. 566\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 584. Those terms apply as definitely to a nondelivery in consequence of a neglect or oversight at the first office as at any other. The moment that the message is received the contract attaches along with the responsibility, and the transit begins. We can perceive no legal distinction between that moment and the next when the message is handed to a transmitting clerk, or that on which a copy is given to a boy at the further end. The hand that holds the paper technically is that of the Company, but no more at the beginning than at the end, and as in fact it is that of servants, reasonable self-protection is allowed to the \n\n[264 U.S. 281, 285]\n\u00a0\n master against their neglects. One such self-protection sanctioned by the decisions is a valuation of the message, with liberty to the sender to fix a higher value on paying more for it. Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 148, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 257. The plaintiff finds no difficulty in valuing the message now. It was at least equally possible to value it when it was sent. See Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve, \n256 \nU.S. 566, 574\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 584; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Warren-Godwin Lumber Co., \n251 U.S. 27\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 69.\n When the message is valued it may be doubted whether the valuation can be affected by the intensity of the vituperative epithet applied to an admitted fault. Kirsch v. Postal Telegraph Cable Co., 100 Kan. 250, 252, 264 Pac. 267. At all events something more would have to be shown than is proved here to take the case out of the general rule. The act of the receiving clerk cannot reasonably be supposed to have been more than a momentary inadvertence. It was not a wilful wrong. The answers to the inquiries were probably the natural consequence of the first error, and the second answer probably was too late to have had any effect upon on the plaintiff's position. See Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n154 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1098. With regard to the amount of the valuation, if it is too low now, Unrepeated Message Case, 61 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 541, it was reasonable in 1917, Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n154 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1098. 38 L. Ed. 883; Unrepeated Message Case, 44 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 670. Whatever effect may be given to the judgment of the Commission in the later case, it was not intended to be retroactive. The rules prescribed by the Commission were to take effect on July 13, 1921.\n We have not adverted to first clause of the exemption, limiting liability to the amount received for sending the message. Obviously this has a narrower scope than the valuation clause and we should hesitate to hold that it exonerated the defendant in this case. Unrepeated Message Case, 61 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 541. \n\n[264 U.S. 281, 286]\n\u00a0\n Another clause not mentioned as yet reads:\n'The Company will not be liable for damages or statutory penalties in any case where the claim is not presented in writing within sixty days after the telegram is filed with the Company for transmission.'\n\n This could not be held to apply literally to a case where through the fault of the Company the plaintiff did not know of the message until the sixty days had passed. It might be held to give the measure of a reasonable time for presenting the claim after the fact was known, in the absence of anything more. But here the plaintiff called on Hackett, the General Manager at Boise, about February 14, 1918, as soon as he knew the facts. Directly after, he received a letter from Hackett regretting the occurrence and enclosing the amount paid by the plaintiff as toll. Three days later the plaintiff returned the check by letter saying 'an acceptance of this check on my part might be construed as a settlement of this matter,' so that the defendant then had written notice that a claim was made. There was further communication and finally on June 18 the plaintiff made a formal written demand. We should be unwilling to decide that the action was barred by this clause. But we are of opinion that his claim is limited to fifty dollars for the reasons given above.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissents. \n\n\n\n","210":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC & MANUFACTURING CO. v. FORMICA INSULATION(1924)\nNo. 102\nArgued: Decided: December 8, 1924\n\n\n\n This is a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in a patent suit. The Westinghouse Electric Company sued the Formica Com- \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 343]\n\u00a0\n pany charging it with infringement of claims 11 and 12 of patent No. 1,284, 432, issued November 12, 1918, to the complainant as assignee, on an application of O'Conor filed February 1, 1913. The patent covered a process for making composite electric insulation materials using paper, muslin, or other fibrous material. The fabric was to be coated on one side with an adhesive liquid, such as bakelite, a condensation product of phenol and formaldehyde. It was then dried by passing it over a series of rollers in a steam-heated oven. The thickness of the coating retained by the paper was regulated by varying the distance between the two rollers and by altering the viscosity of the liquid. The prepared paper was cut into sheets of any desired size, and a plate built up to the required thickness by placing the sheets together with the untreated side of each sheet next to the treated side of the adjacent sheet. The built-up plate was then placed between thin sheet steel plates on which had been rubbed a small amount of machine oil. Any desired number of the steel plates carrying the sheets of paper were placed between the platens of a hydraulic press which had been previously heated by steam. The press was closed and pressure applied to as much as 800 pounds per square inch. Steam heat was first applied and then a cooling period followed. The period of pressure and heat was varied in proportion to the thickness of the plate according to a table set forth. The effect was firmly to cement together the sheets of paper and further to impregnate the paper with the bakelite. Thus the plate was transformed into a hard and compact mass. After cooling, the plates of insulation were removed from the press and clamped between steel plates to prevent warping during the baking. The plates were then placed in ovens, with an air pressure of 140 pounds per square inch, and the temperature regulated between 100 and 140 degrees centigrade. These conditions were main \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 344]\n\u00a0\n tained for approximately eight hours, when the plates were removed from the oven and the finished product allowed to cool. The specifications further said that while the process was used for plates, the material could be similarly produced in the form of channel pieces or tubes that were cylindrical or rectangular in cross section or of other shape, as desired, by pressing in forms of the proper shape. The resultant material had a specific gravity of approximately 1.25, was practically nonabsorbent, even when soaked in hot water, and was insoluble.\n The first 10 claims subsequently allowed in the patent referred to the so-called 'two-step' process, namely, first, the application of heat and pressure to the superposed sheets and cooling them; and, second the baking of them under a lower pressure.\n The eleventh and twelfth claims, however, were as follows:\n'11. The process of manufacturing a nonplaniform article which consists in superposing a plurality of layers of fibrous material associated with an adhesive substance that is adapted to harden under the influence of heat and pressure into a substantially infusible and insoluble condition, and molding the superposed layers by means of a form of the proper shape while applying pressure and heat to compact and harden the materials.\n\n'12. The process of manufacturing a nonplaniform article which consists in superposing a plurality of layers of fibrous material associated with a phenolic condensation product and molding the superposed layers by means of a form of the proper shape while applying pressure and heat to compact and harden the materials.'\n\n It will be observed that there is no express provision or requirement in the eleventh and twelfth claims for the 'two-step' process as an element. The defendants do not use the two-step process but do make nonplaniform articles.\n The defenses were that the two claims were invalid for want of novelty, or if valid must be limited to the \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 345]\n\u00a0\n two-step process. A second defense was that complainant had been guilty of laches estopping it from prosecuting the action, in that it had known of the defendant's manufacture of its composition and its large investment in the business without objection for four years before the claims Nos. 11 and 12 were secured by the defendant as assignee from the Patent Office and did not sue for three years thereafter.\n In reply the plaintiff urged that the defendant being in privity with O'Conor in the assignment and the infringement was estopped to dispute the validity of the eleventh and twelfth claims construed according to the ordinary meaning of their language, which, as it contended, did not require the two-step process.\n The District Court sustained the defense based on complainant's laches and dismissed the bill.\n On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the defense of laches could not be sustained. Coming to consider the defense of estoppel, the court held that on the facts no estoppel arose as to the claims sued on, and proceeding then to the merits found that claims 11 and 12 were invalid for lack of invention.\n O'Conor was a mechanical engineer, and after graduation from college entered the employ of the Westinghouse Company at a small salary, with the understanding that he was to be allowed to work in association with experienced engineers and gain experience in the line of his profession, and that inventions made by him when in the company's employ were to become the property of the company and to be assigned by him to it. O'Conor made this invention and disclosed it by written description to the company, which through its legal department prepared his application for a patent and an assignment, both of which he executed, receiving the nominal consideration of one dollar. Thereafter, pending the appli- \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 346]\n\u00a0\n cation for the patent, O'Conor left the company's employ and associated himself in business with two others in the manufacture of electric insulating material in a partnership, which was thereafter organized into a corporation known as the Formica Company, and its stock divided between the partners. From 1913 the partnership and succeeding company have been engaged in the manufacture and sale of laminated products having a phenolic condensation binder. They have made nonplaniform articles, as well as flat plates, openly and with the knowledge and acquiescence of the Westinghouse Company from the beginning in 1913 down to the time this suit was brought, July 6, 1920\n\n\n When the application for the patent here in suit was filed and was assigned to the company, there were no claims based on a distinction between flat plates and nonplaniform articles. But the specifications signed by O'Conor contained the following:\n'While the process above described is that used for making plates, the insulating material may be produced in the form of channel pieces or tubes that are cylindrical or rectangular in cross section, or of other shape as desired, by pressing in forms of proper shape.'\n\n The art of making insulating material was well advanced when O'Conor entered it. A Haefely patent owned by the Westinghouse Company, when O'Conor began his experiments was for a process for making a hard material offering resistance to the electric current out of paper covered with varnish, wound around a mandrel and subjected to pressure and heat. The art also showed a forming press by Haefely for pressure of flat articles for such a purpose. There was a process patent to Thomson for making insulating material by applying to paper sheets an earthy or mineral substance with binding material, piling such sheets together and drying and heating the resulting mass. Baekland had \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 347]\n\u00a0\n invented much in this art and all before O'Conor. One of his discoveries was that of the 'bakelite' which O'Conor suggests using in his process-a combination of phenol and formaldehyde, a viscous fluid resisting the electric current and attaining great hardness under heat and pressure for use as a binder. Another patent of Baekland was for 'a composite cardboard consisting of superposed layers of paper or the like combined with intermediate layers of an insoluble, infusible condensation product of phenols and formaldehyde,' in which he described his process as follows:\n'I apply to the surface of any of the ordinary grades of paper, or to asbestos paper or the like, a coating of a liquid condensation product of phenols and formaldehyde of such character that it is capable of transformation under the action of heat into an insoluble and infusible body. For this purpose I may use either a liquid condensation product of the character described, or a solution of the same in alcohol or other appropriate solvent. This layer is permitted to dry somewhat, when a second sheet of paper is superposed upon the first and similarly treated, or the several layers may be coated and preferably dried before being superposed. The condensation product may be applied to one or both sides of the sheets. The desired number of sheets having been assembled, the composite article is compacted by pressure, with or without the aid of heat. Heat is now applied in order to effect the transformation of the condensation product into an insoluble and infusible body.'\n\n Messrs. John C. Kerr and Drury W. Cooper, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Dyrenforth, Lee, Chritton & Wiles, of Chicago, Ill. (John H. Lee, of Chicago, Ill., Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., and Wm. H. Dyrenforth, of Chicago, Ill., of counsel), for respondent. \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 348]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The important question in this case is the operation of the principle of estoppel on the character of defense to which the assignor of a patented invention is limited in a suit for infringement by the assignee. We may first usefully consider the rule that should obtain where the assignment is made after the issue of the patent, and then the difference in the rule, if any, where the assignment was made before the granting of the patent.\n Congress under its power to secure for limited times to inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries, has enacted laws conferring such an exclusive right by patent after an application with specification of the invention and claims therefor and a favorable decision by the Commissioner of Patents. The patent of the exclusive right against the public carries with it a presumption of its validity. Agawam Woolen Co. v. Jardon, 7 Wall. 583; Blanchard v. Putnam, 8 Wall. 420; Miller v. Eagle Mfg. Co., \n152 \nU.S. 186\n, 14 S. Ct. 310; Boyd v. Janesville Hay Tool Co., \n158 \nU.S. 260\n, 15 S. Ct. 837. It is not conclusive but the presumption gives the grant substance and value. By section 4898, Rev. St., every such patent or any interest therein shall be assignable in law by an instrument in writing, and the patentee or his assigns or legal representatives may, in like manner, grant and convey an exclusive right under his patent to the whole or any specified part of the United States. The section further provides that an assignment, grant or conveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent Office within three months from the date thereof. While a seal is not required to make an assignment legal, Gottfried v. Miller, \n104 U.S. 521\n, there seems to be no reason why the principles of estoppel by deed should not apply to assignment of a patent right in accordance with the \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 349]\n\u00a0\n statute. Its purpose is to furnish written and recorded evidence of title and to protect the purchaser of the title as recorded for value without notice. It was manifestly intended by Congress to surround the conveyance of patent property with safeguards resembling those usually attaching to that of land. This court has recognized the analogy between estates in land by estoppel and the right to enjoy a patent right in the use of an article conveyed by one without authority but who acquires it by subsequent conveyance. Gottfried v. Miller, \n104 U.S. 521\n; Littlefield v. Perry, 21 Wall. 205.\n There are no cases in this court in which the application of the principle of estoppel as by deed to the conveyance or assignment of patent property has been fully considered. But there are many in the reports of the Circuit and District Court decisions and in those of the Circuit Court of Appeals. They began as early as 1880 in Faulks v. Kamp (C. C.) 3 F. 898, and were followed by a myriad. The rule supported by them is that an assignor of a patent right is estopped to attack the utility, novelty or validity of a patented invention which he has assigned or granted as against any one claiming the right under his assignment or grant. As to the rest of the world, the patent may have no efficacy and create no right of monopoly; but the assignor cannot be heard to question the right of his assignee to exclude him from its use. Curran v. Burdsall, 20 F. 835; Ball & Socket Fastener Co. v. Ball Glove Fastening Co., 58 F. 818, 7 C. C. A. 498; Woodward v. Boston Lasting Machinery Co., 60 F. 283, 284, 8 C. C. A. 622; Babcock v. Clarkson, 63 F. 607, 11 C. C. A. 351; Noonan v. Chester Park Athletic Co., 99 F. 90, 91, 39 C. C. A. 426. There are later cases in nearly all the Circuit Courts of Appeal to the same point. In view of the usual finality of patent decisions in the Circuit Courts of Appeal, this court will not now lightly disturb a rule well settled by 45 years of judicial consideration and conclusion in those courts. \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 350]\n\u00a0\n The analogy between estoppel in conveyances of land and estoppel in assignments of a patent right is clear. If one lawfully conveys to another a patented right to exclude the public from the making, using and vending of an invention, fair dealing should prevent him from derogating from the title he has assigned, just as it estops a grantor of a deed of land from impeaching the effect of his solemn act as against his grantee. The grantor purports to convey the right to exclude others, in the one instance, from a defined tract of land, and in the other, from a described and limited field of the useful arts. The difference between the two cases is only the practical one of fixing exactly what is the subject-matter conveyed. A tract of land is easily determined by survey. Not so the scope of a patent right for an invention.\n As between the owner of a patent and the public, the scope of the right of exclusion granted is to be determined in the light of the state of the art at the time of the invention. Can the state of the art be shown in a suit by the assignee of a patent against the assignor for infringement to narrow or qualify the construction of the claims and relieve the assignor from the charge? The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Siemens-Halske Electric Co. v. Duncan Electric Co., 142 F. 157, 73 C. C. A. 375, seems to exclude any consideration of evidence of this kind for such a purpose. The same view is indicated in subsequent decisions of that court. Chicago Co. v. Pressed Steel Car Co., 243 F. 883, 887, 156 C. C. A. 395; Foltz Smokeless Furnace Co. v. Eureka Smokeless Furnace Co., 256 F. 847, 168 C. C. A. 193. We think, however, that the better rule, in view of the peculiar character of patent property, is that the state of the art may be considered. Otherwise the most satisfactory means of measuring the extent of the grant the government intended and which the assignor assigned would be denied to the court in \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 351]\n\u00a0\n reaching a just conclusion. Of course, the state of the art cannot be used to destroy the patent and defeat the grant, because the assignor is estopped to do this. But the state of the art may be used to construe and narrow the claims of the patent, conceding their validity. The distinction may be a nice one but seems to be workable. Such evidence might not be permissible in a case in which the assignor made specific representations as to the scope of the claims and their construction, inconsistent with the state of the art, on the faith of which the assignee purchased; but that would be a special instance of estoppel by conduct. We are dealing only with the estoppel of an assignment based on the specifications and claims without special matter in pais.\n Mr. Justice Lurton, when Circuit Judge, speaking for the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit, in Noonan v. Chester Park Athletic Co., 99 F. 90, 91, 39 C. C. A. 426, 427, used this language:\n'It seems to be well settled that the assignor of a patent is estopped from saying his patent is void for want of novelty or utility, or because anticipated by prior inventions. But this estoppel, for manifest reasons, does not prevent him from denying infringement. To determine such an issue, it is admissible to show the state of the art involved, that the court may see what the thing was which was assigned, and thus determine the primary or secondary character of the patent assigned, and the extent to which the doctrine of equivalents may be invoked against an infringer. The court will not assume against an assignor, and in favor of his assignee, anything more than that the invention presented a sufficient degree of utility and novelty to justify the issuance of the patent assigned, and will apply to the patent the same rule of construction, with this limitation, which would be applicable between the patentee and a stranger.' \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 352]\n\u00a0\n And he cites the following cases as sustaining this view:\n\n Circuit Court of Appeals, First Circuit, Ball & Socket Fastener Co. v. Ball Glove Fastening Co., 58 F. 818, 7 C. C. A. 498; Babcock v. Clarkson, 63 F. 607, 11 C. C. A. 351; Martin & Hill Cash-Carrier Co. v. Martin, 67 F. 786, 787, 14 C. C. A. 642. Since the Noonan Case, the view thus announced has been approved in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit in Plunger Elevator Co. v. Stokes, 212 F. 941, 943, 129 C. C. A. 461; of the Third Circuit in Roessing-Ernst Co. v. Coal & Coke By-Products Co., 219 F. 898, 899, 135 C. C. A. 562; Piano Motors Corporation v. Motor Player Corporation (C. C. A.) 282 F. 435, 437; of the Fourth Circuit in Leader Plow Co. v. Bridgewater Plow Co., 237 F. 376, 377, 150 C. C. A. 390; of the Sixth Circuit in Smith v. Ridgely, 103 F. 875, 43 C. C. A. 365; Babcock & Wilcox Co. v. Toledo Boiler Works, 170 F. 81, 85, 95 C. C. A. 363; United States Frumentum Co. v. Lauhoff, 216 F. 610, 132 C. C. A. 614; Schiebel Toy & Novelty Co. v. Clark, 217 F. 760, 763, 133 C. C. A. 490; in the Eighth Circuit in Moon Hopkins Co. v. Dalton C., 236 F. 936, 937, 150 C. C. A. 198; and of the Ninth Circuit in Leather Grille & Drapery Co. v. Cristopherson, 182 F. 817, 105 C. C. A. 249.\n We have been speaking of the application of estoppel in the assignment of patents after they have been granted and their specifications and claims have been fixed. The case before us, however, concerns assignment of an invention and an inchoate right to a patent therefor before the granting of it which, after the assignment at the instance of the assignee, ripened into a patent. Section 4895 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  9439) authorizes the granting of a patent to the assignee of the inventor. The assignment must be first entered of record in the Patent Office and in all such cases the application must be made and the specification sworn to by the inventor. It is apparent that the scope of the right conveyed in such an assignment is much less certainly defined than that of a granted patent, and the question of the extent of the estoppel \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 353]\n\u00a0\n against the assignor of such an inchoate right is more difficult to determine than in the case of a patent assigned after its granting. When the assignment is made before patent, the claims are subject to change by curtailment or enlargement by the Patent Office with the acquiescence or at the instance of the assignee and the extent of the claims to be allowed may ultimately include more than the assignor intended to claim. This difference might justify the view that the range of relevant and competent evidence in fixing the limits of the subsequent estoppel should be more liberal than in the case of an assignment of a granted patent. How this may be, we do not find it necessary to decide. We can well be clear, however, that if it is proper to limit the estoppel available for an assignee after patent as against his assignor by reference to the state of the art, a fortiori is such reference relevant where the estoppel is sought by the assignee before patent. In the light of this conclusion, we must now turn to the facts to which it should be applied.\n The art which O'Conor entered was that of a composition of materials for insulating purposes, of leaves of fibrous material like paper superposed one on another and united by an adhesive binder coating the leaves, subjected to heat and pressure and hardened into a compact mass and rendered capable of high resistance to the electric current. In the specification of his patent he disclosed his idea of the defect of the then art, which he proposed to remedy by his process, as follows:\n'Heretofore insulation material such as cardboard composed of layers of paper glued together has proved more or less unsatisfactory because of various defects such as absorption of moisture from the atmosphere, inability to resist heat and chemical action, and lack of physical strength. Insulating material ... must be free from these defects and in addition must possess high dielectric strength.' \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 354]\n\u00a0\n He proposed to achieve his purpose by use of paper or cardboard which was sold for such purpose, by a binder of bakelite or phenol and formaldehyde, also well known for such use, by hydraulic pressure of 800 pounds and steam heat, followed by colling and then by baking in an oven at high heat and low pressure. There was indeed nothing new in O'Conor's invention but the two-step of pressure and heat, cooling and baking. If this two-step process was new, and the estoppel requires us to hold as against O'Conor that it was, his assignee had a right to claim the application of it as new not only to flat articles of composition but also to nonplaniform articles as in the eleventh and twelfth claims for though O'Conor had not made such a claim, his original specification foreshadowed it as reasonable. In view of the art, however, it is very clear that the eleventh and twelfth claims must be read to include as an essential element of the combination therein claimed, the two-step process. Without this, there was nothing new in them in the field to which they applied.\n\n The eleventh and twelfth claims were made by the company as assignee after O'Conor had left the company's employ and were not allowed until four years after O'Conor had participated in the making of the composition herein complained of, and for three years thereafter the company made no objection to his continuing the manufacture. But it is said the assignee was entitled on O'Conor's original specifications to base claims which did not contain as an element the two-step process, because the sixth of his original claims was even broader than the eleventh and twelfth claims as subsequently made and allowed. It was as follows:\n'The process of manufacturing insulating material which consists in superposing layers of coated paper and applying heat and pressure thereto.'\n\n This was promptly rejected by the Patent Office as it must have been in the then state of the art. It was so absurdly broad and all inclusive as almost to \n\n[266 U.S. 342, 355]\n\u00a0\n indicate that it was made to be rejected. O'Conor's signature to such a claim under the circumstances of course does not estop him when in fact it was not allowed, and certainly should not be used to bolster up a broad construction of the eleventh and twelfth claims when as we have said the state of the art must limit them.\n We are clear then that the estoppel of the eleventh and twelfth claims against O'Conor does not extend to a single step process such as he has participated in as partner, stockholder or officer; and if it does not affect him, a fortiori does it not affect the respondent company.\n This result makes it unnecessary for us to consider the objections that the Formica Company is not affected by an estoppel which would operate against O'Conor, or that the alleged nominal character of the consideration moving to O'Conor cannot support an estoppel.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","211":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWHITE v. STUMP(1924)\nNo. 20\nArgued: Decided: November 24, 1924\n\n\n\n Mr. James E. Babb, of Lewiston, Idaho (Tannahill & Leeper, of Lewiston, Idaho, on the brief), for petitioner.\n Mr. Harve H. Phipps, of Spokane, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Peter Stump was adjudged a bankrupt on his voluntary petition, which was accompanied by the usual schedules. Among the assets listed was a quarter section of land on which he and his family had been and were residing; but \n\n[266 U.S. 310, 311]\n\u00a0\n nothing was said at the time about a homestead exemption. Two months later the bankrupt's wife, with his assent, asked that the land be set apart as an exempt homestead for their joint benefit. The trustee objected and on a hearing the exemption was disallowed by the referee. On review that ruling was reversed by the District Court, and on petition for revision the reversal was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 284 F. 199. The case is here on certiorari.\n The laws of the state of Idaho, where the land is situate, provide for a homestead exemption, but only where a declaration that the land is both occupied and claimed as a homestead is made and filed for record as therein prescribed. If the family consist of husband and wife, whether with or without children, either may make the declaration. It 'must' be executed and acknowledge like a conveyance of real property and 'must' be filed for record in the office of the county recorder. The exemption arises when the declaration is filed, and not before. Up to that time the land is subject to execution and attachment like other land; and where a levy is affected while the land is in that condition the subsequent making and filing of a declaration neither avoids the levy nor prevents a sale under it. Comp. Stat. Idaho 1919,  5441, 5462-5465; Smith v. Richards, 2 Idaho (Hasb.) 498, 21 P. 419; Wright v. Westheimer, 3 Idaho, (Hasb.) 232, 28 P. 430, 35 Am. St. Rep. 269; Law v. Spence, 5 Idaho, 244, 48 P. 282; Burbank v. Kirby, 6 Idaho, 210, 55 P. 295, 96 Am. St. Rep. 260.\n Here no declaration was made and filed for record until a month after Stump's petition in bankruptcy was filed and he was adjudged a bankrupt. A declaration was then made and filed by his wife for their joint benefit. Whether in these circumstances there was such a right to a homestead exemption as could be recognized and allowed in the bankruptcy proceeding is the question for decision.\n The District Court gave an affirmative answer in deference to the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for \n\n[266 U.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n that circuit in Brandt v. Mayhew, 218 F. 422, 134 C. C. A. 210, a case arising in California, in which it was held, one judge dissenting, that a bankrupt is not precluded from claiming a homestead as exempt merely because, when the petition in bankruptcy is filed, he has not done all that is required by the state law to entitle him to the exemption, but may rightfully demand that the exemption be allowed where he has met the requirements of the state law within a reasonable time after the filing of the petition. The Circuit Court of Appeals adhered to that decision, and therefore sustained the action of the District Court. Other courts in which the question has arisen have regarded the bankruptcy law as meaning that the right to such an exemption must be tested by the situation existing when the petition in bankruptcy is filed, and have held that where the land is not then exempt under the state law it passes to the trustee for the benefit of the creditors. In re Youngstrom, 153 F. 98, 82 C. C. A. 232; Edgington v. Taylor (C. C. A.) 270 F. 48; In re Lehfeldt (D. C.) 225 F. 681.\n The Bankruptcy Law does not directly grant or define any exemptions, but directs, in section 6 (Comp. St.  9590), that the bankrupt be allowed the exemptions 'prescribed by the state laws in force at the time of the filing of the petition'; in other words, it makes the state laws existing when the petition is filed the measure of the right to exemptions. It further provides that a voluntary bankrupt shall claim the exemptions to which he is entitled in a schedule filed 'with the petition,' and an involuntary bankrupt shall claim his in a schedule filed within 10 days after the adjudication, unless further time be granted (section 7, cl. 8 [ Comp. St.  9591]; that the trustee shall set apart the exempt property and report the same to the court as soon as practicable after his appointment (section 47a, cl. 11 [Comp. St.  9631]); that the trustee shall be vested by operation of law with the title of the bankrupt to all property, in so far as it is not exempt, which 'prior to the filing of the petition' he could by any means have trans ferred \n\n[266 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n or which might have levied upon and sold under judicial process (section 70a [Comp. St.  9654]); and that the bankrupt shall be given a discharge releasing him from debts owing 'at the time of the filing of the petition,' (sections 17 and 63 [Comp. St.  9601, 9647]).\n These and other provisions of the Bankruptcy Law show that the point of time which is to separate the old situation from the new in the bankrupt's affairs is the date when the petition is filed. This has been recognized in our decisions. Thus we have said that the law discloses a purpose 'to fix the line of cleavage' with special regard to the conditions existing when the petition is filed (Everett v. Judson, \n228 \nU.S. 474, 479\n, 32 S. Ct. 568, 46 L. R. A. [N. S.] 154), and that 'it is then that the bankruptcy proceeding is initiated, that the hands of the bankrupt and of his creditors are stayed and that his estate passes actually or potentially into the control of the bankruptcy court' ( Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co., \n239 \nU.S. 268, 275\n, 36 S. Ct. 50, 54; Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co., \n222 \nU.S. 300, 307\n, 32 S. Ct. 96). When the law speaks of property which is exempt and of rights to exemptions, it of course refers to some point of time. In our opinion this point of time is the one as of which the general estate passes out of the bankrupt's control, and with respect to which the status and rights of the bankrupt, the creditors and the trustee in other particulars are fixed. The provisions before cited show-some expressly and others impliedly-that one common point of time is intended and that it is the date of the filing of the petition. The bankrupt's right to control and dispose of the estate terminates as of that time, save only as to 'property which is exempt.' Section 70a. The exception, as its words and the context show, is not of property which would or might be exempt if some condition not performed were performed, but of property to which there is under the state law a present right of exemption-one which withdraws the property from levy and sale under judicial process. \n\n[266 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n The land in question here was not in that situation when the petition was filed. It was not then exempt under the state law, but was subject to levy and sale. One of the conditions on which it might have been rendered exempt had not been performed. Under the state law the fact that the other conditions were present did not suffice. The concurring presence of all was necessary to create a homestead exemption.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","212":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLIAM R. WARNER & CO. v. ELI LILLY & CO.(1924)\nNo. 32\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[265 U.S. 526, 527]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Geo. W. Wickersham, of New York City, Francis Rawle, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Roger S. Baldwin, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. E. W. Bradford, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent is a corporation engaged in the menufacture and sale of pharmaceutical and chemical products. In 1899 it began and has ever since continued to make and sell a liquid preparation of quinine, in combination with other substances, including yerbasanta and chocolate, under the name of Coco-Quinine.\n Petitioner also is a pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturer. The Pfeiffer Chemical Company, Searle & Hereth Company, and petitioner are under the same ownership and control. The first named company in 1906 began the manufacture of a liquid preparation which is substantially the same as respondent's preparation and \n\n[265 U.S. 526, 528]\n\u00a0\n which was put upon the market under the name of Quin-Coco. Two years later the Searle & Hereth Company engaged in the manufacture of the preparation, which ever since has been sold and distributed by petitioner.\n This suit was brought in the federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by respondent to enjoin petitioner from continuing to manufacture and sell the preparation if flavored or colored with chocolate, and also from using the name Quin-Coco, on the ground that it was an infringement of the name Coco-Quinine, to the use of which respondent had acquired an exclusive right. The District Court decided against respondent upon both grounds. 268 Fed. 156. On appeal the Court of Appeals ruled with the District Court upon the issue of infringement, but reversed the decree upon that of unfair competition. 275 Fed. 752.\n The entire record is here and both questions are open for consideration.\n First. We agree with the courts below that the charge of infringement was not sustained. The name 'Coco-Quinine' is descriptive of the ingredients which enter into the preparation. The same is equally true of the name 'Quin-Coco.' A name which is merely descriptive of the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of an article of trade cannot be appropriated as a trade-mark and the exclusive use of it afforded legal protection. The use of a similar name by another to truthfully describe his own product does not constitute a legal or moral wrong, even if its effect be to cause the public to mistake the origin or ownership of the product. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 323, 327; Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Co., \n220 \nU.S. 446, 453\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 456; Howe Scale Co. v. Wyck-off, Seamans & Benedict, \n198 \nU.S. 118, 140\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 609.\n Second. The issue of unfair competition, on which the courts below differed, presents a question of more difficulty. The testimony is voluminous, more than 200 \n\n[265 U.S. 526, 529]\n\u00a0\n witnesses having been examined; but, since the question with which we are now dealing is primarily one of fact, we have found it necessary to examine and consider it. Nothing is to be gained by reviewing the evidence at length, and we shall do no more than summarize the facts upon which we have reached our conclusions.\n The use of chocolate as an ingredient has a three-fold effect: It imparts to the preparation a distinctive color and a distinctive flavor, and to some extent, operates as a medium to suspend the quinine and prevent its precipitation. It has no therapeutic value; but it supplies the mixture with a quality of palatability for which there is no equally satisfactory substitute. Respondent, by laboratory experiments, first developed the idea of the addition of chocolate to the preparation for the purpose of giving it a characteristic color and an agreeable flavor. There was at the time no liquid preparation of quinine on the market containing chocolate, though there is evidence that it was sometimes so made up by druggists when called for. There is some evidence that petitioner endeavored by experiments to produce a preparation of the exact color and taste of that produced by respondent, and there is evidence in contradiction. We do not, however, regard it as important to determine upon which side lies the greater weight. Petitioner, in fact, did produce a preparation by the use of chocolate so exactly like that of respondent that they were incapable of being distinguished by ordinary sight or taste. By various trade methods an extensive and valuable market for the sale of respondent's preparation already had been established when the preparation of petitioner was put on the market. It is apparent, from a consideration of the testimony, that the efforts of petitioner to create a market for Quin-Coco were directed not so much to showing the merits of that preparation as they were to demonstrating its practical identity with Coco- Quinine, and, since it was sold at a \n\n[265 U.S. 526, 530]\n\u00a0\n lower price, inducing the purchasing druggist, in his own interest, to substitute, as far as he could, the former for the latter. In other words, petitioner sought to avail itself of the favorable repute which had been established for respondent's preparation in order to sell its own. Petitioner's salesmen appeared more anxious to convice the druggists with whom they were dealing that Quin-Coco was a good substitute for Coco- Quinine, and was cheaper, than they were to independently demonstrate its merits. The evidence establishes by a fair preponderance that some of petitioner's salesmen suggested that, without danger of detection, prescriptions and orders for Coco-Quinine could be filled by substituting Quin-Coco. More often, however, the feasibility of such a course was brought to the mind of the druggist by pointing out the identity of the two preparations and the enhanced profit to be made by selling Quin-Coco because of its lower price. There is much conflict in the testimony; but on the whole it fairly appears that petitioner's agents induced the substitution, either in direct terms or by suggestion or insinuation. Sales to druggists are in original bottles bearing clearly distinguishing labels and there is no suggestion of deception in those transactions; but sales to the ultimate purchasers are of the product in its naked form out of the bottle, and the testimony discloses many instances of passing off by retail druggists of petitioner's preparation when respondent's preparation was called for. That no deception was practiced on the retail dealers, and that they knew exactly what they were getting, is of no consequence. The wrong was in designedly enabling the dealers to palm off the preparation as that of the respondent. Coco-Cola Co. v. Gay-Ola Co., 200 Fed. 720, 119 C. C. A. 164; N. K. Fairbank Co. v. R. W. Bell Manuf'g Co., 77 Fed. 869, 875, 877-878, 23 C. C. A. 554; Lever v. Goodwin, L. R. 36 Ch. Div. 1, 3; Enoch Morgan's Sons Co. v. Whittier-Coburn Co. (C. C.) 118 Fed. 657, 661. One who induces another to commit a \n\n[265 U.S. 526, 531]\n\u00a0\n fraud and furnishes the means of consummating it is equally guilty and liable for the injury. Hostetter Co. v. Brueggeman-Reinert Distilling Co. ( C. C.) 46 Fed. 188, 189.\n The charge of unfair competition being established, it follows that equity will afford relief by injunction to prevent such unfair competition for the future. Several acts of unfair competition having been shown, we are warranted in concluding that petitioner is willing to continue that course of conduct, unless restrained. Hennessy v. Wine Growers' Ass'n (D. C.) 212 Fed. 308, 311. It remains to consider the character and extent of this relief.\n Respondent has no exclusive right to the use of its formula. Chocolate is used as an ingredient, not alone for the purpose of imparting a distinctive color, but for the purpose of also making the preparation peculiarly agreeable to the palate, to say nothing of its effect as a suspending medium. While it is not a medicinal element in the preparation, it serves a substantial and desirable use, which prevents it from being a mere matter of dress. It does not merely serve the incidental use of identifying the respondent's preparation (Coco-Cola Co. v. Gay-Ola Co., supra, page 724 [119 C. C. A. 164]) and it is doubtful whether it should be called a nonessential. The petitioner or any one else is at liberty under the law to manufacture and market an exactly similar preparation containing chocolate and to notify the public that it is being done. Saxlehner v. Wagner, \n216 \nU.S. 375, 380\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 298; Chadwick v. Covell, 151 Mass. 190, 23 N. E. 1068, 6 L. R. A. 839, 21 Am. St. Rep. 442. But the imitator of another's goods must sell them as his own production. He cannot lawfully palm them off on the public as the goods of his competitor. The manufacturer or vendor is entitled to the reputation which his goods have acquired and the public to the means of distinguishing between them and other goods; and protection is accorded against unfair dealing whether there be a technical trade-mark or not. The wrong is in the sale of the goods of one manufacturer or vendor as those \n\n[265 U.S. 526, 532]\n\u00a0\n of another. Elgin National Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Co., \n179 \nU.S. 665, 674\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 270. If petitioner had been content to manufacture the preparation and let it make its own way in the field of open and fair competition, there would be nothing more to be said. It was not thus content, however, but availed itself of unfair means, either expressly or tacitly, to impose its preparation on the ultimate purchaser as and for the product of respondent.\n Nevertheless, the right to which respondent is entitled is that of being protected against unfair competition, not of having the aid of a decree to create or support, or assist in creating or supporting, a monopoly of the sale of a preparation which every one, including petitioner, is free to make and vend. The legal wrong does not consist in the mere use of chocolate as an ingredient, but in the unfair and fraudulent advantage which is taken of such use to pass off the product as that of respondent. The use disassociated from the fraud is entirely lawful, and if is a against the fraud that the injunction lies. But respondent being entitled to relief, is entitled to effective relief; and any doubt in respect of the extent thereof must be resolved in its favor as the innocent producer and against the petitioner, which has shown by its conduct that it is not to be trusted. Clearly, the relief should extend far enough to enjoin petitioner, and its various agents, from, directly or indirectly, representing or suggesting to its customers the feasibility or possibility of passing off Quin-Coco for Coco-Quinine. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that petitioner should be unconditionally enjoined from the use of chocolate. We think this goes too far; but, having regard to the past conduct of petitioner, the practices or some druggists to which it has led, and the right of respondent to an effective remedy, we think the decree fairly may require that the original packages sold to druggists shall not only bear labels clearly distinguishing petitioner's bottled product from the bottled product of \n\n[265 U.S. 526, 533]\n\u00a0\n respondent, but that these labels shall state affirmatively that the preparation is not to be sold or dispensed as Coco-Quinine or be used in filling prescriptions or orders calling for the latter. With these general suggestions, the details and form of the injunction can be more satisfactorily determined by the District Court. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","213":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILSON v. ILLINOIS SOUTHERN R CO(1924)\nNo. 131\nArgued: January 3, 1924Decided: January 14, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 574, 575]\n\u00a0\n Mr. June C. Smith, of Centralia, Ill., for appellants.\n Mr. George B. Gillespie, of Springfield, Ill., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity to restrain the collection of taxes for the years 1917, 1918, 1919 and 1920 upon the track and rolling stock then belonging to the Illinois Southern Railway Company. It alleges that the property was erroneously and fraudulently overvalued, out of all proportion to the other taxable property in the State, and invokes the jurisdiction of the District Court on the ground that the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution is infringed. It alleges further that the sums that properly could have been charged have been paid, that if the additional amounts demanded could be recovered at all after payment it would be only by a multiplicity of suits against the taxing bodies of the several counties where the collections are made. It is argued that in any proceeding at law in these counties, it would be impossible to secure a uniform or any adequate readjustment of the total valuation, \n\n[263 U.S. 574, 576]\n\u00a0\n which is made by a state board, and so that equity only can afford adequate relief. The bill prays that the defendants, who are the collectors for five counties, may be restrained from applying to their respective county courts for judgments under the summary proceedings provided by statute for the collection of taxes on real estate (Cahill's Ill. St. 1923, c. 120,  191), and that the Court will determine the amounts, if any, remaining equitably due and unpaid. The defendants ultimately relied upon a motion to dismiss for want of equity. The District Court granted an injunction as prayed, and the case is here on the single question whether the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law. When the jurisdiction of the District Court rests solely upon a claim under the Constitution, the merits are open on a direct appeal to this Court. Holder v. Aultman, M. &. Co., \n169 \nU.S. 81, 88\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 269; Northwestern Laundry v. Des Moines, \n239 \nU.S. 486, 491\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 206; McMillan Contracting Co. v. Abernathy, Jan. 7, 1924, \n263 U.S. 438\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 200, 68 L. Ed. --.\n The appellants rely mainly upon Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Salm, \n258 U.S. 122\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 207. In that case a bill charging fraudulent overvaluation was dismissed and the dismissal was affirmed by this Court on two grounds, that there was an adequate remedy at law and that the plaintiff had not tendered or offered to pay the amount confessedly due. The latter ground is absent here. As to the former it seems to us that the present case is to be distinguished. Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Salm arose upon as assessment of real estate by county assessors in a single county, as to which the remedies available were pointed out. Here the assessment was of property in five counties, by the State Board of Equalization for 1917 and 1918, and by its successor the State Tax Commission for the two later years. Assuming that in each of the counties before the tax could be collected a judgment must be obtained in the county court in a civil suit and that in such suits the defendants, the present plaintiffs, \n\n[263 U.S. 574, 577]\n\u00a0\n could set up the facts here relied upon, as in the Keokuk Co.'s Case, not only would those suits be many, but there would be insuperable difficulty in determining what the proper assessment against the whole road should be and in apportioning the due share to the county concerned. This difficulty would recur in each of the five counties with not improbably different results in each. It seems to us that the right of full defence in those suits, if it exists, is not an adequate remedy at law. Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., \n207 U.S. 20\n, 38-40, 28 Sup. Ct. 7, 12 Ann. Cas. 757; Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. R., \n120 \nU.S. 130, 134\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 430.\n We have stated what the appellants relied upon. Perhaps, however, it should be added that after the substitution of the State Tax Commission for the Board of Equalization, a provision was made for an appeal from the Commission to the Circuit Court of the County 'for the purpose of having the lawfulness of such assessment inquired into and determined' upon a record of the evidence and proceedings before it prepared by the Commission, with a further appeal to the Supreme Court. The statute provides that the remedy by appeal shall not be construed to be exclusive. Cahill's Ill. Stat. 1923, c. 120,  10, p. 2853. How far such an appeal would be adequate upon a charge of fraud against the Commission may be doubted, and the adequacy of a remedy at law must be clear. Union Pacific R. R. Co. v.

C., for petitioner.\n Mr. George Ross Hull, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a second petition for a writ of habeas corpus by a Chinese in custody under an order of deportation issued under section 19 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 jj).\n In the first petition the validity of the order was assailed on two grounds: One that the Secretary of Labor \n\n[265 U.S. 239, 240]\n\u00a0\n issued it without lawful jurisdiction, and the other that the administrative hearing on which it rested was not adequate or fair but essentially arbitrary. The return, besides answering the first ground, denied there was in fact any basis for the second. At the hearing in the District Court on these issues the petitioner offered no proof in support of the second ground. The court ruled that the first was not good in law, remanded the petitioner and dismissed his petition. He appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and it affirmed the decision.\n Later the second petition was presented to the same District Court. In it the petitioner relied entirely on the second ground set forth before. There was some elaboration in stating it, but no enlargement of the substance. The petitioner sought to distinguish the two petitions by alleging in the second that the earlier one was 'based solely' on the jurisdictional objection; but that allegation was not true. The return in the second case fully denied the charge that the administrative hearing was inadequate, unfair, and arbitrary, set up the prior petition and the proceedings thereon, and prayed a dismissal of the second petition.\n After a hearing, the District Court ruled that the doctrine of res judicata applied, held the decision in the first case was conclusive in the second; remanded the petitioner, and dismissed the petition. Wong Sun v. Fluckey, 283 Fed. 989. On an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals that decision was affirmed. Wong Sun v. United States, 293 Fed. 273.\n In Salinger v. Loisel, \n265 U.S. 224\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 519, 68 L. Ed. --, just decided we held that in the federal courts the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to a refusal to discharge a prisoner on habeas corpus but that in those courts, where the prisoner presents a second petition, the weight to be given to the prior refusal is to be determined according to a sound judicial discretion guided and controlled by a consideration of whatever has a rational bearing on the subject. \n\n[265 U.S. 239, 241]\n\u00a0\n It therefore must be held that in this case the courts below erred in applying the inflexible doctrine of res judicata. But it does not follow that the judgment should be reversed; for it plainly appears that the situation was one where, according to a sound judicial discretion, controlling weight must have been given to the prior refusal. The only ground on which the order for deportation was assailed in the second petition had been set up in the first petition. The petitioner had full opportunity to offer proof of it at the hearing on the first petition, and, if he was intending to rely on that ground, good faith required that he produce the proof then. To reserve the proof for use in attempting to support a later petition, if the first failed, was to make an abusive use of the writ of habeas corpus. No reason for not presenting the proof at the outset is offered. It has not been embodied in the record, but what is said of it there and in the briefs shows that it was accessible all the time. If an alien whose deportation has been ordered can do what was attempted here, it is easy to see that he can postpone the execution of the order indefinitely. Here the execution already has been postponed almost four years.\n We conclude that the judgment was right, although a wrong reason was given for it. The delay resulting from the course pursued by the petitioner has been unreasonable; so the mandate from this court will issue forthwith.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","215":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWORK v. U S EX REL LYNN(1924)\nNo. 17\nArgued: Decided: November 17, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 161, 162]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. C. Edward Wright, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Conrad H. Syme, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a petition, in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, for a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary of the Interior to pay to the relator as guardian of Rosa Lasley, an incompetent Osage Indian, her share of certain tribal income. The court sustained a demurrer \n\n[266 U.S. 161, 163]\n\u00a0\n to the answer, and on the defendant's declining to plead further, a judgment was entered awarding the writ. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (52 App. D. C. 155, 285 F. 889), and the case is here on writ of error.\n Rosa Lasley is an adult member of the Osage Tribe, enrolled as such, and entitled to share in the tribal income. She never was given a certificate of competency by the Secretary of the Interior. In 1919 the county court of Osage county, Okl., adjudged her an incompetent person and appointed the relator her guardian. Up to the end of September, 1921, her share of the tribal income was regularly paid to the guardian, and he duly accounted therefor to the county court. But the defendant refused to make further payments unless the guardian would agree to invest the moneys in United States bonds or Oklahoma state, county, or school bonds, or to place the same at interest on time deposits in Oklahoma banks. This the guardian declined to do, because he believed the power to direct and control the investment of the moneys, after they were paid to him, was in the county court. Early in 1922, when the petition was filed, the income due to the ward and standing to her credit in the public accounts with the Osages was approximately $9,000 and further sums were becoming due and being so credited.\n In his answer the defendant justified his refusal to pay on the ground that in administering the Act of March 3, 1921, c. 120,  4, 41 Stat. 1249, relating to such payments, he had construed it as meaning that in the case of an incompetent adult having a legal guardian 'all income available, including any amount in excess of $1,000 quarterly, should be paid to the guardian,' but that the payment should, or might in the defendant's discretion, be made subject to a restriction that the \n\n[266 U.S. 161, 164]\n\u00a0\n moneys be invested or deposited as already indicated; that he had given effect to that construction by adopting and promulgating regulations embodying such a restriction, and that the guardian had declined to assent to it.\n Whether the construction so put on the act is right is the question for decision. Other prior and related acts have a bearing on the question.\n The Osage Tribe was settled many years ago on a reservation covering all or much of what is now Osage county, Okl. See chapter 310, 17 Stat. 228.\n By an Act of June 28, 1906, c. 3572, 34 Stat. 539, Congress adopted a plan for distributing the lands and funds of the tribe among its members. Most of the lands were to be allotted in severalty, partly as homesteads and partly as surplus land; and the remaining lands, including some town lots and buildings, were to be sold for the benefit of the tribe. The oil, gas, coal, and other minerals were to be reserved to the tribe for 25 years and leased during that period on royalties. Certain tribal funds were to be held in trust by the United States for 25 years and then paid to the members. In the meantime, and as soon as practicable, these funds were to be segregated and placed to the credit of the individual members on the basis of a pro rata division. The amounts credited were to draw interest and the interest was to be paid to the members quarterly. The interest due to minors was to be paid to the parents, but where the Commissioner of Indian Affairs became satisfied that the parents were misusing or squandering the money further payment might be withheld, and where the parents were deceased payment was to be made to a legal guardian. The proceeds from the lands, town lots, and buildings that were to be sold, together with the royalties from oil, gas, coal, and other mineral leases, and any money received from grazing privileges, were to be placed in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the individual members \n\n[266 U.S. 161, 165]\n\u00a0\n and, subject to deductions not material here, were to be paid to them in the manner at the times the interest on the trust funds was to be paid. For a period of 25 years all members were to be regarded as without capacity to sell or dispose of the lands allotted to them, save where adults were given certificates of competency by the Secretary of the Interior on his finding, after investigation, that they were fully capable of caring for their own affairs. On the issue of such a certificate the lands of the member other than the homestead were to be taxable, and he was to have the right to manage, control and dispose of all excepting the homestead.\n Some changes in the act were effected by a joint resolution of February 27, 1909 (35 Stat. 1167), and an act of March 3 of the same year ( chapter 256, 35 Stat. 778), but they are without present bearing.\n By an Act of April 18, 1912, c. 83, 37 Stat. 86, Congress altered the first act in some respects and supplemented it in others. The only provision then adopted and material here expressly subjects to the jurisdiction of the local county courts the estates of Osages who are deceased or are orphan minors, insane or otherwise incompetent. That provision is as follows:\n'Sec. 3. That the property of deceased and of orphan minor, insane, or other incompetent allottees of the Osage Tribe, such incompetency being determined by the laws of the state of Oklahoma, which are hereby extended for such purpose to the allottees of said tribe, shall, in probate matters, be subject to the jurisdiction of the county courts of the state of Oklahoma, but a copy of all papers filed in the county court shall be served on the superintendent of the Osage Agency at the time of filing, and said superintendent is authorized, whenever the interests of the allottee require, to appear in the county court for the protection of the interests of the allottee. The super \n\n[266 U.S. 161, 166]\n\u00a0\n intendent of the Osage Agency or the Secretary of the Interior, whenever he deems the same necessary, may investigate the conduct of executors, administrators, and guardians or other persons having in charge the estate of any deceased allottee or of minors or persons incompetent under the laws of Oklahoma, and whenever he shall be of opinion that the estate is in any manner being dissipated or wasted or is being permitted to deteriorate in value by reason of the negligence, carelessness, or incompetency of the guardian or other person in charge of the estate, the superintendent of the Osage Agency or the Secretary of the Interior or his representative shall have power, and it shall be his duty, to report said matter to the county court and take the necessary steps to have such case fully investigated, and also to prosecute any remedy, either civil or criminal, as the exigencies of the case and the preservation and protection of the interests of the allottee or his estate may require,' etc.\n\n Next came the Act of March 3, 1921, with which we are particularly concerned. It enlarges the period for which the oil, gas, coal and other minerals were reserved, extends the life of all valid oil and gas leases existing at the end of the original period and changes the original plan in some other particulars. Section 4 is the important one here and reads as follows:\n'Sec. 4. That from and after the passage of this act the Secretary of the Interior shall cause to be paid at the end of each fiscal quarter to each adult member of the Osage Tribe having a certificate of competency his or her pro rata share, either as a member of the tribe or heir of a deceased member, of the interest on trust funds, the bonus received from the sale of leases, and the royalties received during the previous fiscal quarter, and so long as the income is sufficient to pay to the adult members of said tribe not having a certificate of competency \n\n[266 U.S. 161, 167]\n\u00a0\n $1,000 quarterly except where incompetent adult members have legal guardians, in which case the income of such incompetents shall be paid to their legal guardians, and to pay for maintenance and education to the parents or natural guardians or legal guardians actually having minor members under twenty-one years of age personally in charge $500 quarterly out of the income of said minors, all of said quarterly payments to legal guardians and adults, not having certificates of competency, to be paid under the supervision of the Superintendent of the Osage Agency, and to invest the remainder after paying all the taxes of such members either in United States bonds or in Oklahoma state, county, or school bonds, or place the same on time deposits at interest in banks in the state of Oklahoma for the benefit of each individual member under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe,' etc.\n\n While this section is in some respects loosely framed, we think its purpose and meaning are reasonably plain-particularly when it is examined in the light of the prior acts, the mischief it was intended to correct, and its legislative history.\n When the first act was passed it was believed that the income to be paid quarterly would not be in excess of the current needs of the members. For about 10 years that proved to be true. Thereafter increased production of oil and gas under the leases that were given resulted in royalties which swelled the income to a point where the quarterly payments were greatly in excess of current needs and were leading to gross extravagance and waste. Administrative measures restricting the payments were adopted, but their validity was questioned (see Work v. Mosier, \n261 \nU.S. 352\n, 43 S. Ct. 389), and the matter was called to the attention of Congress by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary recommended the enactment of a provision which, as respects all members other than adults \n\n[266 U.S. 161, 168]\n\u00a0\n with certificates of competency, would enable him, in his discretion, to limit the payments to amounts deemed necessary for the maintenance of the members and to invest the excess for their benefit for such time and in such manner as appeared to him advisable. A bill to that effect was introduced but not passed. Instead, section 4 as set forth above was enacted. It evidently is designed to be comprehensive of payments to members of every class; to distinguish between such adults as have certificates of competency and such as are without them, and also between adults and minors; to cover all payments to legal guardians, whether on behalf of incompetent adults or minors, and all payments to parents on behalf of minor children; to limit the amounts to be paid where a limit is deemed advisable; and to authorize and require the investment of the excess in designated securities or time deposits. Unlike the provision that was proposed and rejected, the section is intended in itself to limit the amounts to be paid, in so far as they are to be limited, and to prescribe the manner of investing the excess. Thus it directly determines the questions which the rejected provision was intended to commit to the judgment of the Secretary.\n The obviously mistaken use of the words 'to pay' and 'to invest' in some of the clauses instead of 'shall cause to be paid' and 'shall invest,' or their equivalents, does not introduce any uncertainty into the section or affect its meaning. The sense is made plain by the context.\n In our opinion the section must be taken as making it the plain duty of the Secretary to cause the several payments of income to be made in the amounts and at the times specified, and to invest the excess, where there is such, in prescribed securities, or to deposit it in prescribed banks, for the benefit of those to whom it is owing. The investment clause obviously refers to the moneys which \n\n[266 U.S. 161, 169]\n\u00a0\n are withheld, not to those which are paid. Where the payment is to a guardian, the county court alone is empowered to direct and control the investment of what is paid. This is apparent when the section is read, as it should be, with section 3 of the act of 1912, before quoted. Under the latter the Secretary may invoke action by the county court in respect of any matter affecting the Indian ward's estate, and, where he does he is entitled as of right to a full consideration of the matter presented; but he can exercise no direct control over the use or investment of the money after it is paid to the guardian.\n The defendant relies on the clause requiring all payments to guardians and adults without certificates of competency to be made 'under the supervision' of the superintendent of the Osage Agency; but we think this clause is not intended to cut down or narrow the others and that it refers to a supervision designed to effectuate the payments specifically directed by other clauses, and gives no warrant for imposing conditions at variance with such directions. There is ample room for supervision, and also need of it, without enlarging or narrowing any clause by construction.\n We hold therefore that the Secretary exceeded his authority in imposing a restriction as to how the money should be invested or deposited after it was paid to the guardian.\n For the purposes of these payments the section assigns the members of three major classes. The first comprises all adults having certificates of competency, the second all adults who are without such certificates, and the third all minors. The directions for payment take up the classes in that order. As to the first the direction is that the member be paid his full share of the income. Whatever is due is to be paid. As to the other classes the directions begin with the qualifying words 'so long as the income is sufficient' and then proceed to require \n\n[266 U.S. 161, 170]\n\u00a0\n that specific amounts be paid. As to the third class the amount is $500 for each member, whether the payment is to his parents or to his guardian. As to the second class the direction, apart from the qualifying words just noticed, is 'to pay to the adult members of said tribe not having a certificate of competency $1,000 quarterly, except where adult members have legal guardians, in which case the income of such incompetents shall be paid to their legal guardians.'\n In his answer the defendant took the position that this provision, while limiting each payment to $1,000 out of the member's share where he is without a guardian, requires that the full share be paid where he has a guardian. Afterwards the defendant changed his position and came to insist that the limit of $1,000 applies where the member has a guardian as well as where he is without one. The courts below acceded to the first position. But we are of opinion that the later insistence is right. The directions as a whole show that the personal capacity of the member is made the test of whether his full share of the income shall be paid, or only a limited amount deemed sufficient for his current needs. If he is an adult and has a certificate of competency showing he is fully capable of managing his own affairs the full share is to be paid; otherwise only a limited sum-$1, 000 where he is an adult and $500 where he is a minor. The clause saying, 'except where incompetent adult members have legal guardians, in which case the income of such incompetents shall be paid to their legal guardians,' is not an independent direction, but merely an excepting clause showing that the income which under the principal provision would be payable to the ward is to go to the guardian. In this respect it puts guardians of members who are in the second class on the same plane that the next provision puts guardians of members who are in the third class. In both cases the guardian is to receive what would \n\n[266 U.S. 161, 171]\n\u00a0\n go to the ward if he were not under guardianship, and no more. This is what naturally would be expected, and we think it is what the statute intends.\n Our conclusion on the whole case is that a writ of mandamus was rightly awarded, but that instead of commanding the defendant to pay the ward's full share of the income, it should have commanded him to recognize and respect the right of the relator to be paid, without any restriction as to how the same should be invested or deposited, $1,000 quarterly out of the ward's share so long as it is sufficient for the purpose. Because of the error in that regard, the judgments of both courts will be reversed and the case remanded to the Supreme Court of the District for the entry of a judgment in conformity with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","216":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASS'N OF COLUMBUS, OHIO, v. DAVIS(1924)\nNo. 249\nArgued: January 11, 1924Decided: February 18, 1924\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. I. Boulger, of Columbus, Ohio, Frank Davis, Jr., of Washington, D. C., Henry A. Williams, of Columbus, Ohio, and Guy W. Mallon, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioners.\n Mr. Arthur J. Vorys, of Columbus, Ohio, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Mary J. Sessions, a citizen and resident of Columbus, Ohio, died on April 1, 1919, leaving a will executed September \n\n[264 U.S. 47, 48]\n\u00a0\n 17, 1914, and disposing of a considerable estate. The executor paid a tax of $31,000 to the United States as the so-called 'estate tax' under the Revenue Act of 1918, enacted February 24, 1919 (chapter 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1096 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/4a, et seq.]).\n The question in the case is what effect this payment shall have in the distribution of the estate among the legatees and beneficiaries under the will. After providing that her just debts and funeral expenses be paid, and making a number of specific legacies and devises, the testatrix gave the rest, residue, and remainder of all her property, of every description, including lapsed legacies, to the Young Men's Christian Association of Columbus, the Young Women's Christian Association of Columbus, Ohio, Berea College, and the American Missionary Association, to be divided equally among them.\n Section 401 of the Estate Tax Law, ubi supra (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/4 b), imposes 'a tax equal to the sum of the following percentages of the value of the net estate,' determined as provided in section 403, 'upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of this act.' Then follow the percentages graduated according to value.\n Section 403 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/4 d) provides that for the purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be determined in the case of a resident of the United States by deducting (1) funeral and administration expenses, claims against the estate, losses from casualties not insured against and amounts which by law of the domicile are required for support of dependents of testator, but not including income taxes or estate, succession, legacy or inheritance taxes, but (2) including property received by decedent by will or descent within five years on which an estate tax was paid, and (3) deducting:\n'The amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or gifts, to or for use of the United States, any state, territory, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, for exclusively public purposes, or to or for \n\n[264 U.S. 47, 49]\n\u00a0\n the use of any corporation organized ... exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, ...' and ( 4) 'an exemption of $50,000.'\n\n It is admitted that the corporations mentioned in the residuary clause of the will come within the description of subdivision (3).\n The executor deducted from the gross estate the debts, losses, and charges and the specific devises and bequests to find the value of the residuary estate, which, together with the debts, losses, and charges, and $ 50,000, he then deducted from the gross estate, to get the value of the net estate by a proper percentage of which the tax was measured and fixed. After paying the tax, he brought an action in the common pleas court of Franklin county, Ohio, asking the direction of the court as to whether the tax should be deducted from the amounts which were about to be distributed to the specific legatees and devisees, or from the residuary estate given to the charitable and educational institutions named. All those taking under the will were made defendants. The common pleas court and the Court of Appeals of Franklin county and the state Supreme Court all held that the tax must be paid out of the residuary estate, and a judgment was entered accordingly. We have brought the case here by certiorari because of the federal question, seasonably made in all the courts by the residuary legatees, that in the payment of the federal estate tax out of their residuum they are deprived of a federal right of exemption from the tax intended to be secured to them by subdivision (3) of section 403.\n The argument of the petitioners is that, as the tax is expressly made equal to a percentage of the value of the net estate and is imposed upon the transfer of that net estate, Congress cannot have intended that the tax \n\n[264 U.S. 47, 50]\n\u00a0\n should be paid out of the very gifts which by subdivision (3) are excluded from the net estate. It is further urged that the manifest purpose of Congress was to exempt the beneficiaries under subdivision (3) from tax and the result of the construction by the Ohio courts is in this case that they are the only ones to pay it. These arguments are persuasive, but they derive much of their strength from the special circumstances of the present case. They are pressed from a different standpoint from that of Congress. What was being imposed here was an excise upon the transfer of an estate upon death of the owner. It was not a tax upon succession and receipt of benefits under the law or the will. It was death duties, as distinguished from a legacy or succession tax. What this law taxes is not the interest to which the legatees and devisees succeeded on death, but the interest which ceased by reason of the death. Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 48\n, 49 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 747.\n Congress was thus looking at the subject from the standpoint of the testator and not from the immediate point of view of the beneficiaries. It was intending to favor gifts for altruistic objects, not by specific exemption of those gifts but by encouraging testators to make such gifts. Congress was in reality dealing with the testator before his death. It said to him:\n'If you will make such gifts, we will reduce your death duties and measure them, not by your whole estate, but by that amount, less what you give.'\n\n In section 408 it is declared to be the intent and purpose of Congress that as far as it is practicable, and unless otherwise directed by the testator, the tax is to be paid out of the estate before distribution.\n There is nothing in subdivision (3) of section 403 which exempts the recipients of altruistic gifts from taxation; it only requires a deduction of them in calculating the amount of the estate which is to measure the tax. It exempts the estate from a tax on what is thus deducted just \n\n[264 U.S. 47, 51]\n\u00a0\n as subdivision (4) exempts in terms the estate from taxation on its first $ 50,000; but this does not operate to exempt any legatee who may be entitled to the first $50,000 in the distribution from deduction to contribute to the tax ultimately imposed, if by the law of the state such should be its incidence.\n It was wholly within the power of the testatrix to exempt her altruistic gifts from payment of the tax by specific direction to her executor if she chose. It must be presumed, when she failed to exercise the power, that she intended the incidence of the tax to be where otherwise by law it must be, and therefore that it was her purpose that her residuary legatees were to receive all that was left after paying all charges, including this tax, out of her estate. The donees of the altruistic gifts profit much by the deduction made under subdivision (3), even though they do receive less by the amount of this tax. Had subdivision (3) not been in the statute, the tax would have been much heavier, measured by a higher percentage of the value of the whole estate including their gifts. It is hardly true to say that under the judgment of Ohio courts these residuary gifts are taxed. The gifts are and were intended by the testator to be indefinite in amount, and to be what was left after paying funeral expenses, attorney's fees, executor's compensation, debts of the decedent, and taxes. These donees do not pay the taxes, any more than they pay the funeral expenses, the lawyers, the executors, and the testator's debts.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","217":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nZIANG SUNG WAN v. U S(1924)\nNo. 127\nArgued: Decided: October 13, 1924\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. C. Dennis, Frederic D. McKenney, James A. O'Shea, Charles Fahy, and John W. Davis, all of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Peyton Gordon, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n[266 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On January 31, 1919, the police department of the District of Columbia learned that three Chinamen, the inmates of a house in Washington occupied by the Chinese Educational Mission, had been murdered. They were known to have been alive late in the evening of January 29. Police officers were told by Li, a student, that, earlier on the same evening, he had seen at the Mission a resident of New York City named Wan. Acting under instructions of the superintendent of police, two detectives started immediately for New York, taking Li with them. On February 1, they entered Wan's room in a lodging house, found him there, and brought him to Washington. He was not formally arrested until February 9. Later, \n\n[266 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n he was indicted, in the Supreme Court of the District, for the murder of one of the Chinamen; was found guilty; and was sentenced to be hanged. The Court of Appeals of the District affirmed the judgment. 289 F. 908, 53 App. D. C. 250. A writ of certiorari was granted. \n263 \nU.S. 693\n, 44 S. Ct. 34.\n The main question for decision1 is whether, on the facts disclosed in the testimony of the superintendent of police, three detectives and the chief medical officer of the jail, the trial court erred in admitting as evidence statements made by the defendant to the police officers before and shortly after his formal arrest. \n2\n Four of the statements were oral. These, if admissible, were important evidence. The fifth was a stenographic report of an interrogation of the defendant conducted by the detectives, after the arrest. This report contained a full confession. The introduction of each of the statements was duly objected to on the ground that the government failed to show that it had been voluntarily made and that from the testimony of its own witnesses the contrary appeared. The court admitted the statements. It later charged the jury:\n'The test of the case, and the inquiry that you will have to \n\n[266 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n make in answer is, Did the questioning, did the physical condition, did the importunate questioning, if you choose to call it so, render the confession made by the defendant not his own; but did it substitute for his will the will of another, and thus was it or not his voluntary act?'\n\n Wan was a native of China. He had come to the United States in 1916, at the age of 22, as a student. In 1918, he engaged in a business which proved unsuccessful. Since December of that year, or earlier, his health had been bad. He had an attack of Spanish influenza. He suffered continuously from a chronic stomach trouble which led him to eat sparingly and irregularly. When the detectives entered his room unannounced they found him in bed. They had no search warrant; but they made a search of the room and his effects, including the bed in which he lay. They were accompanied by a New York police officer; but they did not arrest Wan. They requested that he return with them to Washington. He told them he was too sick. Li, who had been left waiting outside the closed door and was called in, told Wan that both of them were suspected of the murder. Then, Wan consented to go with the detectives to Washington.\n On arrival in Washington, Wan was not put formally under arrest; but he was taken to a secluded room. In the presence of three detectives, the superintendent of police, and Li, he was subjected there to questioning for five or six hours. Late in the evening of that first day, the detectives took him to Hotel Dewey; and, without entering his name in the hotel registry, placed him in a bedroom on an upper floor. In that room he was detained continuously one week. Throughout the period, he was sick and, most of the time, in bed. A physician was repeatedly called. It was a police surgeon who came. In vain Wan asked to see his brother, with whom he lived in New York, who had nursed him in his illness, who had come to Washington at his request in January, who had returned with \n\n[266 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n him to New York, and whom, as he later learned, the detectives had also brought to Washington, were detaining in another room of the hotel, and were subjecting to like interrogation.\n Wan was held in the hotel room without formal arrest, incommunicado. But he was not left alone. Every moment of the day, and of the night, at least one member of the police force was on guard inside his room. Three ordinary policemen were assigned to this duty. Each served eight hours; the shifts beginning at midnight, at 8 in the morning, and at 4 in the afternoon. Morning, afternoon, and evening (and at least on one occasion after midnight) the prisoner was visited by the superintendent of police and\/or one or more of the detectives. The sole purpose of these visits was to interrogate him. Regardless of Wan's wishes and protest, his condition of health, or the hour, they engaged him in conversation. He was subjected to persistent, lengthy, and repeated cross-examination. Sometimes it was subtle, sometimes severe. Always the examination was conducted with a view to entrapping Wan into a confession of his own guilt and\/or that of his brother. Whenever these visitors entered the room, the guard was stationed outside the closed door.\n On the eighth day, the accusatory questioning took a more excruciating form. A detective was in attendance throughout the day. In the evening, Wan was taken from Hotel Dewey to the Mission. There, continuously for ten hours, this sick man was led from floor to floor minutely to examine and re-examine the scene of the triple murder and every object connected with it, to give explanations, and to answer questions. The places where the dead men were discovered; the revolver with which presumably the murder was committed, the blood stains and the finger prints thereon; the bullet holes in the walls; the discharged cartridges found upon the floor; the clothes of the murdered men; the blood stains on the \n\n[266 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n floor and the stairs; a bloody handkerchief; the coat and pillow which had been found covering the dead men's faces; photographs, taken by the police, of the men as they lay dead; the doors and windows through which the murderer might have entered or made his escape; photostat copies of writings, by means of which it was sought to prove that Wan was implicated in a forgery incident to the murder; all these were shown him. Every supposed fact ascertained by the detectives in the course of their investigation was related to him. Concerning every object, every incident detailed, he was, in the presence of a stenographer, plied with questions by the superintendent of police and the detectives. By these he was engaged in argument; sometimes separately, sometimes in joint attack. The process of interrogation became ever more insistent. In passed at times from inquiry into command. From 7 o'clock in the evening until 5 o'clock in the morning the questioning continued. Before it was concluded, Li, who was again in attendance, had left the Mission about midnight, worn out by the long hours. The superintendent of police had returned to his home, apparently exhausted. One of the detectives had fallen asleep. To Wan, not a moment of sleep was allowed.\n On the ninth day, at 20 minutes past 5 in the morning, Wan was taken from the Mission to the station house and placed formally under arrest. There the interrogation was promptly resumed. Again the detectives were in attendance, day and evening, plying their questions, pointing out alleged contradictions, arguing with the prisoner, and urging him to confess, lest his brother be deemed guilty of the crime. Still the statements secured failed to satisfy the detectives' craving for evidence. On the tenth day, Wan was 'bundled up,' was again taken to the Mission, was again questioned there for hours, and there 'the whole thing was again talked of and enacted.' On the eleventh day, a formal interrogation \n\n[266 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n of Wan was conducted at the station house by the detectives in the presence of a stenographer. On the twelfth day, the verbatim typewritten report of the interrogation (which occupies 12 pages of the printed record) was read to Wan, in his cell at the jail. There he signed the report and initialed each page. On the thirteenth day, for the first time, Wan was visited by the chief medical officer of the jail, in the performance of his duties. This experienced physician and surgeon testified, without contradiction, to the condition of the prisoner:\n'[He] found ... [Wan] lying in a bunk in the cell, very weak, very much exhausted, very much emaciated; he complained of abdominal pain, which was rather intense. He told witness, and witness afterwards saw, that he vomited if he attempted to take food; that it was difficult or impossible for his bowels to move unless they were assisted by an enema; witness thought he was very seriously ill; ... ordered certain tests by the laboratory; ... had his blood examined and his abdomen X-rayed and had him removed from the cell to the Red Cross room; ... concluded he was suffering from spastic colitis [ involving contraction of the bowels]. ... The result of that contraction would be almost constant pain, excited by any further additions to the contents of the tract at that point, and vomiting and persistent constipation. ... Witness knows defendant was in bed at least a month after his treatment was prescribed. From witness' observation and medical experience, judging from the defendant's emaciation and history he gave witness, and his condition generally, would say that when witness saw the defendant on February 13th he had been ill for a matter of weeks. ... He told me he had been talked to all one night and had not received any medical attention, and had been in constant pain all of this time and had been unable to eat for days, and considering all those facts I came to the conclusion \n\n[266 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n that he was so exhausted that he was really-he told me also that he had signed a confession.'\n\n Then the witness was further questioned by the court:\n'Question. You thought he was so exhausted mentally that he would not know what he was signing. ... Would he know what he was signing?\n\n'Answer. He would know what he was signing, yes.\n\n'Question. Would he be liable to sign a confession that would lead him to the gallows in that condition?\n\n'Answer. I think he would, if he wanted to be left alone.\n\n'Question. With spastic colitis, if he was accused of crime he would simply sign a paper and say, 'You hang me'? This is your opinion as a medical man?\n\n'Answer. I say, if he was as sick as that, and in as great pain as that, he would do anything to have the torture stopped.'\n\n The Court of Appeals appears to have held the prisoner's statements admissible on the ground that a confession made by one competent to act is to be deemed voluntary, as a matter of law, if it was not induced by a promise or a threat, and that here there was evidence sufficient to justify a finding of fact that these statements were not so induced. In the federal courts, the requisite of voluntariness is not satisfied by establishing merely that the confession was not induced by a promise or a threat. A confession is voluntary in law if, and only if, it was, in fact, voluntarily made. A confession may have been given voluntarily, although it was made to police officers, while in custody, and in answer to an examination conducted by them. \n3\n But a confession obtained by compulsion must be excluded whatever may have been the \n\n[266 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n character of the compulsion, and whether the compulsion was applied in a judicial proceeding or otherwise. Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532\n, 18 S. Ct. 183.4 None of the five statements introduced by the government as admissions or confessions was made until after Wan had been subjected for seven days to the interrogation. The testimony given by the superintendent of police, the three detectives and the chief medical officer left no room for a contention that the statements of the defendant were, in fact, voluntary. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[266 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n The undisputed facts showed that compulsion was applied. As to that matter there was no issue upon which the jury could properly have been required or permitted \n\n[266 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n to pass. The alleged oral statements and the written confession should have been excluded. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The indictment was found on September 30, 1919; the verdict rendered on January 9, 1920; and the sentence imposed on May 14, 1920. The time for filing the bill of exceptions, which under the rule would have expired June 21, 1920, was, on that day, extended to November 1, 1920; and it was not filed until the latter date. Before it was settled, the judge who had presided at the trial died. A motion to vacate the judgment, made on this ground, was denied on November 22, 1921. Thereupon the bill of exceptions was signed by the Chief Justice of the court. It was contended here, among other things, that the judgment should be set aside because a bill of exceptions can be settled only by the judge who presided at the trial. The contention is unfounded. Roney v. United States, 43 App. D. C. 533. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] With the exception of these statements, the government introduced only circumstantial evidence. The defendant testified on his own behalf, asserting his innocence. He described the conditions under which the statements had been made, denied or explained them, and insisted that the confession was a suggested one. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Hopt v.

The character of the pressure applied is illustrated by the following extracts from the testimony of the detectives:\n'... Sometimes witness has sat and talked to him, or rather talked at him twenty minutes or half an hour, and asked him could he explain certain phases of this case, without his uttering a word or making any reply whatever.'\n\n'A good many times during the course of the investigation he would ask to be left alone, but we did not leave him alone, and we would ask him a question, and if it was rather pointed he would say he was tired, to leave him alone, 'I will talk no more to you.' Sometimes would be 20 or 30 minutes before he would answer or say a word; ... asked him the same questions over and over again a great many times without getting any answer at all. ...\n\n'... Defendant had continuously asked to be alone and not bothered whenever he was asked a pointed question and if he answered it it might implicate him or embarrass him; he would say, 'Let me alone, I talk no more to you tonight, I don't feel well.' This was done repeatedly whenever he was pressed for an answer to a pointed question; sometimes we would leave him alone and witness sometimes stayed there and talked at him for a while until we got tried of it; ... told defendant witness thought his sickness was more in his mind than in his body.' \n\n On the eighth day, at the Mission: 'Well, he sat and rolled his eyes when I asked him why he came out to the house the second time, why he did not go to the cafe instead of coming away out to the house, and he sat there and rolled his eyes at me and Burlingame [another of the detectives] said, 'Answer his question,' and then he turned to his brother and started in the Chiness language, and Burlingame said, 'Here, don't speak Chinese; answer Kelly's question,' Then he raised up with a coat hanger and Burlingame caught him on the shoulders and said, 'We don't want anything like that here.' This was about 1 o'clock in the morning, and we left somewhere around 4 o'clock; not much was said after 4 o'clock, just talking; Burlingame objected to defendant talking in Chinese, because he wanted him to answer questions; requested him once and then sat him down in the chair. ...\n'... Defendant was not permitted to sleep or to go back to hotel . ...\n\n'... Witness did try to force an answer out of him by asking him to answer the questions, but not by physical force or anything of that kind ; ... it was on that occasion [on the ninth day, at the station house, after the allnight interrogation at the Mission] that witness told defendant, 'If you are guilty, and your brother is innocent, I want to know, for I am holding your brother just the same as I am holding you.' Witness thinks he said, 'Now is the time to tell me,' intimating to him that he had been in confinement a long time and witness wanted to know something about it; they were both in confinement and witness was anxious for him to tell about his brother; was satisfied he was guilty but did not tell him so at that time; was just about that time witness said 'things look bad for you,' or 'things look black for you,' and you ought to tell me the truth. ... Went over practically and rehashed all the case as far as they had learned about it and related all the circumstances against him; told him a lot of things, but never offered any inducement, because witness has had too much experience in that line.'\n\n Witness went to the station house Sunday night for the purpose of still talking to him about the case. 'I wanted to straighten out a great many circumstances which pointed to him; ... wanted to know from him whether he was guilty; wanted him to tell the truth; asked him on a number of occasions to tell the truth, and those circumstances which pointed very strongly against him, strongly indicated to witness' mind that he knew a great deal more about the case than he told of; that we had caught him in several contradictory statements and witness said; 'We are all firmly of the belief that you know who killed those men;' sat and watched him and looked at him carefully and for a long time after I would tell him those things and would say, 'Now you think it over,' and stayed right there with him.\n'Q. Your purpose in telling him those things was to make him talk?\n\n'A. My purpose was to get him to tell me the truth about this case.\n\n'Q. Answer the question will you?\n\n'A. Well, he had to talk.'\n\n'...
